Abby Bogart was called a virus at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. The 13-year-old, who is both Asian American and Black, was deeply hurt by the
remark, which she says was made by someone she had considered to be a close friend at the time. "I remember that day bawling to my mom," she said. "We were just
sitting there hugging each other and talking it out. We were just very emotional and it was a very sad night."
One in eight Asian Americans reported hate incidents in 2020, according to a national coalition battling the problem. And one in 10 reported anti-Asian hate incidents in
the first quarter of 2021, including physical assaults, verbal harassment, civil rights violations and online harassment.
It's an issue that affects adults and children, according to the latest data from the San Francisco-based nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate.
Of those who reported hate incidents in 2020, 16% came from Asian Americans ages 12 to 20. And about 80% of them reported being bullied or verbally harassed, often
at school, Stop AAPI Hate found.
Racism against people of Asian descent is an ongoing problem, "but this pandemic, it has been more active," said Bogart, an eighth-grader at Metro Early College Middle
School, a public STEM school on the Northwest Side. "Since the pandemic, I feel like it's more blatant."
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans overall reached an "alarming level" in the United States, according to an August report by the United Nations. More than 1,800 racist
incidents against Asian Americans were reported from March to May.
The attacks included physical assaults, vandalism, verbal harassment, denial of access to services and public spaces, the report said. Victims also reported being spat on,
blocked from public transportation, discriminated against in workplaces, shunned, beaten, stabbed, and insulted as transmitters of the coronavirus.
In March, a Georgia man went on a shooting spree at three Atlanta spas, killing eight people, including six Asian women, provoking fear in a community already feeling
fearful and intimidated in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
A month earlier, a 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed across the face with a box cutter and left bleeding inside a New York City subway train as his assailant fled.
And in late January, an 84-year-old Thai immigrant in San Francisco was violently shoved to the ground and died after what his family called an attack "driven by hate"
and prosecutors said was horrific and senseless. ProQuest document 1 of 1 Full Text Newspaper ' I feel like it's more blatant ' : Students afraid amid rise in anti - Asian hate Henry , M.

And in late January , an 84 - year - old Thai immigrant in San Francisco was violently shoved to the ground and died after what his family called an attack " driven by hate " and prosecutors said was horrific and senseless . With the rise in hate incidents nationwide and the new school year less than a month away, many Asian American students in central Ohio are bracing for the potential of
new or continued verbal assaults by fellow students when they return to school in the fall.
"I am obviously concerned about possible instances that could occur regarding my race," said Lou Cariello, who is Asian American.
The 17-year-old senior at Bexley High School chose to do her schooling remotely last year because of concerns about contracting COVID-19 and xenophobic comments by
classmates about Asians and the origin of the virus.
"I was scared to even walk around my neighborhood with my dogs because I didn't want anyone to look at me as they were driving by or say something," she said.
About 2% of Bexley school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander, according to the most recent data from the Ohio Department of Education. At Columbus City
Schools, the state's largest district, the percentage is nearly 4%.
Cariello, who was adopted from China when she was a year old, remembers some students asking her racist questions even before the pandemic such as, 'Do you
support eating dogs?', 'Why are you eating that weird food?' and 'Are you a communist?'
"I didn't want to imagine what it was going to be like if I went back to school in-person in the midst of everything going on," she said.
She currently plans to go back to school in person for her senior year and said she has a couple of teachers she feels comfortable confiding in if something were to
happen.
Racist incidents targeting Asian Americans occurred before COVID-19, but the pandemic increased the frequency and level of bullying, said Sharon Kim, a member of Ohio
Progressive Asian Women's Leadership, a grassroots community group committed to empowering women of Asian and Pacific Islander descent.
"Being targeted because of someone's race or ethnicity or whatever difference, these are concerns that us parents have had even before the pandemic," she said. "The
sad fact of the matter is the pandemic... just really increased the bullying that was already present."
Even before their son Elliot was born, she and her husband worried about him being harassed and bullied because of his Asian ethnicity.
"It's not if it's going to happen, it's when it's going to happen," Kim said.
Elliot, now 5, is going to be a first-grader at Ecole Kenwood French Immersion Elementary School in Columbus City Schools. He recently told his mother, she said, how
someone pulled back their eyes at him as part of a racist gesture in 2019 when he was in preschool.
"It's pretty heartbreaking," she said. "It's just a reminder that this kind of racialized experience is already in his life experience as something that's probably going to
happen again."
The pandemic has "really shown how the world views Asian Americans and it's been incredibly disheartening," said Annie Johnson, a junior at Dublin Coffman High School.
She said schools should take action against students who make racist remarks.
"My race, my heritage, my culture is not a joke. It's not your punchline," said Johnson who is Asian American and white. "A lot of these jokes, I don't get what's funny
about it."
About 21% of Dublin school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander, according Ohio Department of Education data.
Hearing xenophobic comments takes a toll on the 15-year-old.
"It's so frustrating just because you know you are hearing this and it's not true but at the same time, you know there's nothing you can do about it," Johnson said.
Another way schools can help Asian American and other minority students is by hiring employees whose job is to focus on inclusion and equality for all students in every
school building, said Gloria Chan, a 17-year-old senior at Thomas Worthington High School.
Nearly 5% of Worthington school students are Asian American or Pacific Islander like Chan, according to the latest state education data.
"I think it really starts with the teachers, because if the students are allowed to get by with that in the classroom, then they are going to do it outside of the classroom
and at home, and it's just going to get worse," Chan said.
