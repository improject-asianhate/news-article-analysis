An Asian American father was attacked while walking outside of a grocery store in San Francisco's Mission Bay neighborhood with his 1-year-old child, ABC 7 reports.
The 36-year-old victim, who asked to be called "Bruce," was waiting to cross the street at the intersection of 4th and Channel streets last Friday afternoon, according to a
police report obtained by SF Gate. His child was sitting in a stroller.
Police say the alleged attacker 26-year-old Sidney Hammond struck the man from behind, causing him to fall to the ground.
"I was right on the ground and in that exact second I was trying to shield my head and prevent any worse injuries," Bruce told ABC 7. "I couldn't protect my child. I was
on the floor and he was in a stroller that was slowly rolling away, so it's definitely very scary as a parent."
Bruce fears the attack was racially motivated but police say the attack was likely random and not racially motivated.
Bruce told ABC 7 that he had one wish:
"That my attacker can be somewhere where he can't harm anyone else or if he needs help he can get the help he needs."
Hammond has been charged with assault, false imprisonment and child endangerment and is currently in county jail, SF Gate reports.
