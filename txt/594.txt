A video posted on Reddit's r/PublicFreakout forum featuring a white man admitting to being racist towards an Asian American man has gone viral.
The video was posted by Reddit user u/tefunka and taken in the parking lot of 798 House, a restaurant in El Monte, California. It shows an Asian American man
confronting a white man in the parking lot.
The white man can be seen calling the Asian American "f*cking Chinese" and an "Asian motherf*cker." He tells the Asian American man to "go eat some f*cking rice" and
to go back to his country.
"I was born here, motherf*cker," the Asian American man replies. "Why don't you go back to your own f*cking country?"
The White man tells the Asian American man that "this is [his] country." The Asian American man asks him if he is an aboriginal, referencing the fact that Native Americans
were in the country before either of them.
The Asian American man also calls the White man a racist, and the White man admits to being racist.
"Yeah, I'm f*cking racist," the man replies. "I'm protecting my f*cking country, you motherf**ker."
It is unclear how the incident started. The Reddit post states that the man called the driver a racist slur, and the Asian American man, who was also a passenger
defended the driver. The video has gone viral on Reddit.
