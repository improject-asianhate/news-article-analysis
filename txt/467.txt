Spiking anti-Asian violence in the United States has prompted people in Asia to reconsider study plans at US universities and question their confidence in America as a
world role model, according to a report.
Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Americans scapegoating China as the source of COVID-19 has targeted random Asian people, including the elderly, hurling
racial slurs or even launching violent attacks, which resulted in deadly incidents, USA TODAY reported on Wednesday.
On March 16, six of the eight people killed in a mass shooting at Atlanta-area spas were Asian women. On April 15, many of the victims in a shooting at a FedEx facility in
Indianapolis were Sikh, a religion with origins in India.
Asian people stated the violence soiled impressions of the United States as racially tolerant society and a top choice for overseas study and research, according to the
newspaper.
"The human toll (from) the recent race-based violence has challenged those previously held beliefs" among South Koreans that America was a model for good
governance and multicultural society, Leif-Eric Easley, associate professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul, told the daily
Japanese national Akiko Horiba, 43, noted that she found Americans to be "kind" during her graduate study in Boston from 2001 to 2003, but now she's unsure whether
she would come if she had the chance again.
"I would be a little afraid to visit America because I'm a woman and I saw a video of someone beating Asian ladies, I don't really recommend it to the younger
generation," Horiba, who works in Tokyo, told the paper.
The Stop AAPI Hate, a group tracking incidents of violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than 2,808 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate
from March 2020 through the end of the year.
The California-based advocacy group tracked 987 in the first two months of 2021, the report quoted the group as saying. - FNA
