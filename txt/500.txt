"I don't have the answer to solving racism, but more racism is not the solution."
Ty Penserga
Boynton Beach vice mayor
BOYNTON BEACH - Horrific accounts of violence targeting Asian Americans have dominated headlines in recent weeks, but Boynton Beach Vice Mayor Ty Penserga can
attest it's not a recent phenomenon.
Penserga, born in the Philippines and the only elected official in Palm Beach County of Asian descent, said he was "bullied and picked on" as a kid for his looks and vividly
recalls getting "jumped" at JFK Middle School in Riviera Beach by a pair of attackers using made-up words like "chong" and "ching" while they beat on him.
Penserga, 32, will be one of the speakers Saturday afternoon at a vigil in Lake Worth Beach's Bryant Park to remember the victims in a surge of attacks against Asian
Americans around the country, including in Atlanta where six Asian American women were among eight people killed during a shooting rampage on March 16.
Asian Americans, Penserga said, are "seen as the punching bag. We are the ones that nobody is afraid of. We are the ones that don't fight back. That's what I wish
would change. People need to know that we will fight back and that we are a political force to be reckoned with."
A paucity of established national political leaders have made Asian Americans an easy group to target, Penserga laments. He draws a comparison with Black people and
figures like Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson "who organize, bring attention, apply pressure and get people to change" when social issues affect their community.
"We don't have that," Penserga said.
Hate crimes against Asian Americans in major U.S. cities jumped by 150 percent in 2020, according to a study by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at
California State University, which based its numbers on police department statistics.
That increase took place while overall hate crimes fell by 7 percent, according to the study.
The situation doesn't seem to have gotten any better in 2021 with a series of high-profile incidents including:
The shootings at three Altanta-based spas that left eight people dead, including six women of Asian descent. Robert Aaron Long, 21, is facing eight first-degree murder
counts but authorities have not filed hate crime charges against him.
New York City police arrested a man this week for brutally stomping on a 65-year-old Filipino woman in an assault widely viewed on social media. Brandon Elliott, on
parole for killing his mother, allegedly told his victim "you don't belong here" during the attack.
In January, an 84-year-old native of Thailand going for a morning walk in his San Francisco neighborhood was pushed from behind by a man galloping at full speed and
died from injuries sustained after he hit the pavement. A 19-year-old man has been charged in the case.
Former President Donald Trump has drawn criticism for inflammatory rhetoric around the COVID-19 epidemic that many, like Penserga, say has led to the burst in racist
incidents.
Trump regularly referred to the coronavirus as the "kung flu" or "Chinese virus."
Penserga, a chemistry teacher at Suncoast High School, said that he was recently asked by one of his students why it was wrong to refer to the "China virus."

" "What Trump has done is give permission to people to lash out, to make snide comments, to blame Asian Americans for all these problems, and it has only exacerbated
the situation," said Penserga, who emigrated to the U.S. with his mother when he was 6. "But it was there long before this."
Anti-Asian bigotry spurred Penserga
to get into politics
Despite his own early experience with anti-Asian bigotry, Penserga said he didn't realize the depth of the problem until he was a student at Temple University in
Philadelphia.
The siblings of his Asian friends reported repeated incidents of harassment and physical violence and Penserga was gripped by "how helpless they felt."
That left him with the realization that "no one was coming to help us, but ourselves," moving him to get into politics.
Penserga said his speech at Saturday's vigil will include the "complicated fact" that several of the recent incidents in which Asian Americans were victimized were allegedly
perpetrated by Black men.
Comparisons between Blacks and Asian Americans, who are perceived to be succeeding in America despite their minority status, have long existed in order to divide the
races, Penserga said.
Blacks are told, "Hey, look at those Asians. They're doing well. Why can't you?" Penserga said. That breeds resentment and distrust.
"I don't have the answer to solving racism, but more racism is not the solution," Penserga said.
Saturday's vigil is being sponsored by the Bangladeshi-American Democratic Club and will take place from noon to 3 p.m. at Bryant Park, located at 100 Golfview Road.
"We need to get back to the soul of this country which is, united we stand," said Junaid Akther, the club's president. "That's the way we should live."
Penserga, who was raised in Boynton Beach, said he hasn't been singled out for physical violence since middle school, but has been subjected to more subtle racism,
especially since the COVID-19 outbreak.
At the beginning of the pandemic, Penserga said people "would just move out of my way" when he went grocery shopping. He still "gets looks" and hears muffled
comments from other customers when he enters restaurants.
"They're uncomfortable that you're there and want you to get up and leave," Penserga said.
"But I'm not getting up and leaving."
