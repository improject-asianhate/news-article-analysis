Phoenix Police DepartmentThe family of a Filipino American man killed in Phoenix after being struck in the face
is a victim of an anti-Asian hate crime, reports People.
Police say 41-year-old Marcus Williams punched 71-year-old Juanito Falcon in the face for “no apparent reason.”
Falcon fell to the ground, suffered head injuries and died two days later in the hospital on February 18.
Authorities arrested Williams March 4.

motivated.
