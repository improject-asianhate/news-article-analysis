Denny Kim was walking to dinner in Koreatown in February when he was attacked.
Two men approached Kim, a 27-year-old Air Force veteran, and shouted anti-Asian slurs, including "Chinese virus," before taking a swing at him. He was left with a black
eye and an injured nose.
It was "absolutely unprovoked," Kim, who is Asian American, told KTLA-TV at the time. "I didn't know who these guys are."
He had become one of a growing number of victims of anti-Asian hate crimes, which continue to surge in Los Angeles and around the country, a new study has found. The
Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino examined police data from 16 jurisdictions across the country, finding a 164% increase in reports
of anti-Asian hate crimes in the first quarter of 2021 compared with the same period last year.
New York saw the greatest increase, at 223%, followed by 140% in San Francisco, 80% in Los Angeles and 60% in Boston. Some cities, including Phoenix, Seattle and
Miami, reported no change.
The study's author, Brian Levin, said the jurisdictions were chosen because they have large Asian American populations and a history of collecting reliable data on hate
crimes.
"There's a national story, and there's also local and regional stories, but it's fairly consistent," said Levin, the center's director and a professor of criminal justice. "The
nature of these crimes are violent."
In Los Angeles, there were nine documented anti-Asian hate crimes in the first quarter of this year, while in San Francisco, there were 12. Both cities had five in the same
period last year. ProQuest document 1 of 1 Full Text ❘ Newspaper Study confirms surge in attacks ; Hate crimes against Asian Americans rose 164 % in first quarter ; L.A. saw 80 % increase .

Both cities had five in the same period last year . Heightened awareness often drives increased reporting, but Levin said the study's findings point to a legitimate jump in violence.
"Some of this increase that we've seen is going to be due to what we call 'reporting effect,' certainly, but not at this level," he said. "You have all these jigsaw puzzle
pieces you put together, but it points to a horrifying surge in violence against our Asian American community, which is being sustained."
Some experts have noted that such attacks are probably underreported because of language barriers or technological issues.
Hate crimes are defined as criminal acts motivated by characteristics such as race, religion or sexual orientation. Hate incidents do not rise to the level of criminality but
include acts like bullying, name calling and verbal abuse.
A California-based advocacy organization for Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, Stop AAPI Hate, said it received nearly 3,800 reports of attacks nationwide between
March 19, 2020, and February 28, 2021. About 68% were verbal harassment, 21% were shunning (deliberate avoidance), and 11% were physical assaults.
According to Levin's report, the first-quarter increase follows a historic surge that began in March last year amid a rise in both COVID-19 cases and the "political and
online stigmatizing of Asians." In 2020, anti-Asian hate crimes increased 146% across 26 of the country's largest jurisdictions, the report says.
This year, attacks in the U.S. have included spitting, rock throwing and harassment. Many Asian Americans believe the Atlanta-area shootings in March that left eight
people dead, including six Asian women, were hate crimes, though law enforcement officials have said racial bias did not appear to be a motive.
Experts point to a number of factors behind the surge, including the use during the pandemic of stigmatizing language such as "Kung flu" and "China virus."
In March 2020, then-President Trump tweeted the phrase "China virus" more than 20 times, the report says. Spikes in Google keyword searches for the phrase appeared
as recently as this January, according to the report -- the same month Trump used it in a tweet decrying as "fake news" the COVID-19 case and death counts from the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Dorinne Kondo, professor of American studies and ethnicity at USC, said the uptick in attacks is not surprising.
"There's no doubt that Trump legitimized the public expression of what some people may have secretly felt... but it builds on histories that have been here since
inception," Kondo said.
Anti-Asian sentiment is woven into much of American history, Kondo said, from the California Alien Land Law of 1913, which made land ownership illegal for immigrants,
to Japanese American internment camps during World War II.
New laws and leadership may help, Kondo added, but the problems won't disappear overnight.
"The thing about hate crime is it's not irrational hate," she said. "It's the absolutely predictable outcome of structural inequality, so these incidents will continue as long
as there are structural inequalities."
In California, several of the recent incidents have been violent and sustained.
In one, an Asian American woman in El Cerrito was spat upon and called racist slurs while in her own garage. In another, a Ladera Ranch family was repeatedly harassed
with rocks, verbal attacks and pounding at the door over the course of several months.
In yet another Los Angeles incident, an attacker in Eagle Rock apparently mistook an elderly Latina woman for Asian, calling her an anti-Chinese slur before reportedly
pulling her hair and breaking her nose.
In California, where 15% of residents are Asian or Pacific Islander, several areas have taken steps to address the increase in attacks. The Orange County Board of
Supervisors in March unanimously passed two resolutions denouncing hate crimes and committing to taking action. Huntington Beach took a similar step in April.
The Los Angeles Human Relations Commission in 2019 launched the L.A. vs. Hate campaign to address issues in the county. Campaign leader Terri Villa-McDowell said
Tuesday that victims can report hate crimes and hate incidents without going though law enforcement by dialing 211 or filling out a form online. Reports can be made
anonymously and are accessible in 140 languages.
The state is considering legislation that would establish a Commission on the State of Hate, which would provide more resources to various agencies and the public,
require a minimum of four community forums each year and require comprehensive accounting of hate crimes statewide, among other goals.
California Assemblyman Richard Bloom, who authored the legislation, Assembly Bill 1126, said he was driven by "frustration with increased hate locally and around the
world."
"We can't eradicate hate, but we can name it and aim to understand how and why feelings of dislike snowball into full-blown hateful conduct and hate crimes," Bloom
said in an email.
If the bill becomes law, the commission will be the first of its kind in the nation, he said.
Levin noted that if the study's first-quarter findings are any indication for the rest of the year, there is much work to be done.
"This is one quarter of one year with only 16 jurisdictions," he said. "It's horrifying."
