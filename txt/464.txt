"We have to be comfortable being uncomfortable."
J. Chong, on speaking out against racist language and behavior
ASHEVILLE - What was supposed to be an easy cooking lesson devolved into a display of hate.
Chef J. Chong didn't flinch when racists invaded her Zoom cooking tutorial to hurl bigoted epithets. It didn't even feel real until she saw the look of horror on her wife's
face.
Chong was broadcasting a cooking lesson via the video conferencing tool Zoom to support the Campaign for Southern Equality. Chong's wife, Danielle Wheeler, who is
white, was behind the camera.
The hateful torrent the video-bombers unleashed on her livestream, from homophobic insults to anti-Asian slurs, flowed freely for all who joined to hear.
The 20-second incident was punctuated with an insidious lie: "Coronavirus is here because of you," one in the group of invaders yelled at Chong.
That was in April 2020, and violence against Asian-Americans has only intensified.
Over the past year, Asian Americans reported the greatest year-over-year increase in serious incidents of online harassment, according to a new survey the Anti-
Defamation League shared with USA Today.
"Asian-American people are still now being blamed for (COVID) to this day, a year into this pandemic," Chong, who was born in Canada and moved to Gulfport,
Mississippi, on a soccer scholarship.
Still, Chong said bigotry has always been a part of her life, even when she lived as a child in multicultural Toronto. Her first memory of experiencing racism because of her
Chinese heritage was at the age of 5.
"I experience a lot of microaggressions growing up," she said. Those included jokes about Asian people, which a young Chong laughed off.

Chong, now 43, is not sure why those jokes were acceptable then, but the impulse to shrug off the insults remained ingrained in her as an adult. It was on display when
her Zoom class was interrupted.
"At that moment, it didn't even emotionally affect me," Chong said. "I've dealt with it my whole life. Unfortunately, I'm numb and was able to continue and just bounce it
off."
But Chong said the look of terror on her wife's face as she stood in the kitchen the couple shares
said she felt violated.

A voice for Asian-Americans
Chong has not been deterred from sharing her love of cooking throughout the pandemic. A former sous chef with Katie Button restaurants, Chong still teaches
Cantonese cooking and other techniques with an affable, easy style.
Her food can be found at a variety of pop-ups, most announced through @jchong_eats on Instagram. Her handmade dumplings are also a hot commodity at local farmers
markets.
On March 20, Chong set up her dumpling stand at the ASAP Farmers Market with a mission: to donate all proceeds to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders Women Lead
and NQPIA, the National Queer Asian Pacific Islander Alliance.
Just days earlier, a white man had systematically gunned down eight people, most of them Asian-American women, in Atlanta-area massage parlors.
Chong promoted her benefit on social media and gained a few new customers at market that day. Others donated funds through Venmo.
"It felt good and it was heartwarming to know that people are becoming aware and trying to take a stand," said Chong, who raised more than $1,200 that day for the
two groups supporting Asian women.
'Be comfortable being uncomfortable'
Still, there's more work to be done, and Chong said she'll continue to use her voice to lift up the Asian community and bring awareness to ongoing violence.
Despite the increased media attention, she said, many in the Asian community continue to feel invisible.
"I still think there is a large part of the population that does not see us or understand what is happening," she said.
Erin McGrady, co-owner of Authentic Asheville and a Korean-American, said Asian-owned businesses deserve extra attention right now.
Chinese restaurants have been hit especially hard with prejudice leading to precipitous drops in business. A year ago, in the height of pandemic fear, more than half of
the nation's Chinese restaurants closed, some permanently, according to Restaurant Business.
"Purchase from Asian-owned businesses like J. Chong's," McGrady said. "She did an amazing thing last weekend in donating 100% of her proceeds back to the AAPI
community. We can all in turn support her and others in our community."
McGrady mentioned El Kimchi food truck, Wild Ginger Noodle Bar, Itto Ramen Bar and Tapas and Lee's One Fortune Farm among her favorite Asian-owned businesses.
She also recommended business owners take the Don't Ask Your Black Friend webinar by Jefferson Ellison of the Asheville-based Jawbreaking Creative. The course
teaches entrepreneurs how to incorporate anti-racism into marketing efforts.
"It's one of the best ways to start or continue your journey towards being an ally for people of color," McGrady said. "I can't emphasize enough the importance about
what is shared in the course."
Laura Smith, a South Korea-born chef who moved to Birmingham when she was 5 months old to live with adoptive parents, is the co-owner of Baba Nahm at the Grove
Arcade.
Smith said she did not grow up with racism, but that hasn't prevented her from fuming with anger about the ongoing hate against people of color.
Most recently, said Smith, she's been watching the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, who knelt for nine minutes on George Floyd's neck.
Darnella Frazier, who shot the infamous video of Floyd as he gasped for air, told prosecutors she has stayed up some nights "apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd
for not doing more and not physically interacting and not saving his life."
"I don't want to be someone who stands on the sidelines and records," said Smith. "I want to make a difference. Where are we in this day and age, and why do we
stand by?"
Smith also mentioned the brutal attack on 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight, in connection with which Brandon Elliot, 38, of New York City, was
recently arrested.
In a surveillance video, staff of the luxury apartment in front of which the assault took place closed the door in front of the grievously injured woman.
"If you can't act to protect a person of color, at least speak up about it," Smith said.
People, she said, need to be educated about the various forms racism takes and move into accepting that the United States has a real problem.
"It has not gone away," Smith said of racism. "But it should."
Eliminating racism, said Chong, will take more than not being racist; it will require actively working to be anti-racist.
She said the onus is on bystanders, particularly white people, to step up and use their voices for change.
"It can't always come from the people who are targeted," said Chong. "It has to come from power, and in the United States white people have a lot of power - it's time
for that community to speak up." " When we're young , we want people to like us , so it's very difficult to tell people not to make Asian jokes , " she said .
