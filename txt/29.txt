Hundreds of people huddled with signs reading "#StopAsianHate" on Saturday afternoon steps from Chinatown Square in Chicago's latest protest against anti-Asian racism after the shooting spree across Atlanta-area spas this month that left eight dead, six of them women of Asian descent. 
The 2 p.m. rally was led by the Chinatown Security Foundation and the Coalition for a Better Chinese American Community, with more than 65 other Asian American organizations in attendance, according to an event summary.
It follows other protests over the past week that also drew hundreds in Chicago to speak out against the recent surge of violence and racism targeting Asian Americans, including a Friday night vigil at Horner Park.
Julie Moy, an 18-year-old from McKinley Park, had brought her 15-year-old cousin to the outdoor mall in the plaza that morning when they noticed a sign advertising the rally plastered on a restaurant. They walked over to the tables set up on the other side of the "Chinese in America" mural and grabbed some posters.
"We decided to join because there aren't many rallies against Asian hate, and it just needs to be more of a thing," Moy said.
Her younger cousin Jason added, "My side of the family is actually from Chinatown, so I feel like being Chinese is deeply rooted in who I am. I feel that it's important to show our support, especially since what happened to the people in Georgia."
The March 16 massacre in Georgia deepened an old wound for the Asian American community already grappling with a year of fear following the coronavirus pandemic, which many felt caused them to be scapegoated. In recent months, there has also been a wave of reported violence against Asian Americans across the U.S., including an alleged attack last weekend in Chicago that remains under police investigation.
The rally began with an acknowledgment of three Asian American men who were killed in Chicago last year. They were Weizhong Xiong, 38, and Huayi Bian, 37, who both were fatally shot in a Chinatown parking lot in February 2020, and Shuai Guan, 33, who was killed in a shooting in Bridgeport last December. Their deaths came during a year of skyrocketing crime in the city.
Chris Huang, president of the Chinatown Security Foundation, discussed plans to add more security cameras to the neighborhood but said the United States's deep-rooted prejudice against Asians cannot be solved by that alone.
"This attitude of Asians being looked down on, taken advantage of, treated unfairly have been here since my grandfather came to work on the railroad in the early 1900s," Huang said.
Grace Chan McKibben, executive director of CBCAC, said Saturday's protest was part of a "growing movement of Asian Americans demanding that our voices be heard." The Georgia shootings have only "heightened the nation's awareness of the racism and sexism that our community has been all too familiar with," she added.
AARP Illinois executive council member Nancy Chen led the crowd in a chant of "enough is enough" after sharing her personal fears as older Asian Americans face heightened vulnerability in the recent violence.
"I'm a 76-year-old grandmother," Chen said. "I know exactly how our elderly folks in our community feel. ... We should not have to be worried about walking on the street in our neighborhood and worry about being attacked and killed."
Nationwide, anti-Asian hate crime reports surged by 149% last year, according to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University's San Bernardino campus. That is despite a 7% drop overall in 2020 hate crime reports.
And a national coalition of Asian American organizations collected 3,795 reports on anti-Asian racism from March 2020 to February, finding almost 70% of them came from Asian women.
The organizers of the rally presented five demands: increase Chinatown safety; respond to anti-Asian hate crimes with timeliness and cultural sensitivity; create a website to report such attacks; pass an Illinois bill to mandate teaching Asian American history in public schools; and fund Asian American community organizations.
Illinois Department of Human Services Secretary Grace Hou, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle attended, as well as multiple lawmakers from Illinois' congressional delegation and statehouse.
Foxx, who in her remarks dinged former President Donald Trump for what she said was espousing "white supremacy" during the COVID-19 pandemic, noted her office's role in prosecuting suspects in the three homicides in Chinatown and Bridgeport.
"Though the pandemic has slowed down our court systems, it has not slowed down our quest for justice," Foxx said. "Those cases are still pending. We will seek justice and accountability."
Moy and Jason, the two cousins from McKinley Park and Chinatown who joined the rally, said the rally surprised them with the large crowds spilling onto the second floor of the mall and the racial diversity among its attendees.
"I wasn't really expecting this," Jason said. "I feel like very proud and happy to see such a great turnout for the rally."
