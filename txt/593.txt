An elderly Asian man is speaking out after he was attacked in Los Angeles' Koreatown last September, ABC 7 reports. The man says he saw his attacker days after they
were arrested.
On September 20, Samuel Kang was waiting for a bus at the corner of 5th Street and Western Avenue when the suspect attacked him. Kang told ABC 7 the attacker told
him to go back to his country.
"Son of a b--, m----, go back to your country, go back to your country," Kang recalls the attacker saying.
The suspect was arrested. Court records show the suspect was released hours later. Kang saw him a few days after the attack.
"I was just distraught and flabbergasted. I want the justice system to do its work better than before and how I was treated," Kang told ABC 7.
Attacks against Asian Americans have risen throughout the pandemic. Stop AAPI Hate, an organization tracking anti-Asian hate incidents, has recorded 9,081 incidents
from March 19, 2020, to June 30, 2021.
Many of the attacks have victimized elderly Asian people like Kang. Now, some cities have organized groups of volunteers to walk elderly Asian people home, PIX11
reports.
