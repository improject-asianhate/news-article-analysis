Late Tuesday morning, an Asian American mother says she was spit at and called the “Chinese virus,” in the
Queens borough of New York City. Officials are now investigating the incident as a hate crime, ABC 7 NY reports.
The 25-year-old mother told police the incident occurred between 10:30 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. in the area of
Kissena Corridor Park in the Fresh Meadows neighborhood, PIX11 reports.
The woman said the man spit on her and called her the “Chinese virus” several times. The NYPD’s Asian Hate
crimes Task Force is investigating the incident as a possible hate crime.
The suspect is thought to be a man in his 30s, about 200 pounds, 5’5″ tall, according to ABC 7 NY.
The incident will be confirmed as a hate crime if the attacker commits the offense again.
