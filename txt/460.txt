Photo via FacebookA Sky Zone in Maple Grove, Minnesota, closed temporarily after reports of an alleged racial attack. The incident is said to have involved two children, who made
racially insensitive comments towards one another.
News of the incident was spread through social media. On April 16, Angela Kim described an attack on a boy name Enzo.
"Finding out that Enzo was racially attacked and physically assaulted tonight and I wasn't there just makes me feel some sort of way!!!!!!!!" Kim wrote in her post.
She said that Enzo asked two adults for help, but did not receive it. A parent also
On April 17, Kim posted again thanking people for their support. She added that they were working with Sky Zone in Maple Grove to comb through security footage to identify the
other people involved. She alluded to the fact that the attackers had made jokes about the coronavirus and told Enzo to go back to his own country.
As Am News attempted to contact Kim to clarify her relationship with Enzo and the incident but have not heard back.
Yana Reko later posted further details about the incident to her Facebook page on behalf of a "friend because she's tired and feeling defeated."
Reko said that on Saturday "a sibling of one of our students" was attacked at the Sky Zone in Maple Grove. The 10-year-old boy was cornered, slapped, choked, body-slammed,
told to go back to China and screamed at about bringing the Chinese flu to America. Reko says the boy was not Chinese.
Maple Grove Police were informed of the incident on April 18. In an April 26 press release, they confirmed that an incident between two juveniles aged 9 and 10 had occurred on
April 16 at the Maple Grove Sky Zone.

racial comments" towards each other.
It is unclear at this time what comments may have been made to the other child involved. AsAm News contacted Maple Grove Police Department who said they could not give out
further information. ProQuest document 1 of 1 Full Text Newspaper Trampoline Park Temporarily Closed After Racial Incident Tamanaha , A. ( 2021 , Apr 28 ) .
