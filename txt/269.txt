After reviewing my interview notes for the whole year, I find one word that sticks out - racism. I have listened to
the stories of many members from the Chinese community since COVID-19 began spreading in the United
States early this year and Asian Americans first reported facing racial bias.
Closing the notebook, I saw three faces in my mind's eye - they are filled with confusion, frustration and fear.
Never more fearful
Julie Tang had been a judge at the San Francisco Superior Court for 26 years. The person who understands
more of self-protection than average people said she was "happy sheltering in my little condominium "because
she did not want to risk being spit upon or told to go back to China.
Though racial prejudice is not new to the Chinese immigrant who has lived in the US for 50 years, Tang said she
has never felt more fearful for her personal safety than now.
"I just don't want to confront it now because this is a very scary time. It is like going back to a war where you
can be shot at," she said. "When racism rears its ugly head, we don't know if we can protect ourselves or our
family."
Some of my friends told me they sympathize with the fear of the retired judge even though they have not
experienced any incident yet.

Anti-Chinese racism the other side of pandemic

A friend said she has been relying on online grocery delivery since March just to avoid any potential racist
incident.
Firsthand experience
Simon is a student of biology from China at the University of Texas' MD Anderson Cancer Center. When he was
shunned on the street while wearing a mask in March, he was not sure if the act was racist until he read the
news about rising racism against Asians.
One of the first violent racist attacks related to COVID-19 happened on March 14 in Midland, Texas. Three Asian
American family members, including a 2-year-old and a 6-year-old, were stabbed because the suspect thought
the family "infected people with the coronavirus".
For the first time in his life, Simon, who preferred to be called by first name only, said he searched the internet
for tips on how to respond to racist attacks.
"I think you would not understand the feeling of being discriminated against until you have experienced it
yourself," he said.
Finding support online
Elaine Peng is a mental health advocate and educator in the Bay Area.
What aggravates the challenges that the pandemic has already posed for her service recipients is the US
government's attempted ban on WeChat.
The Chinese social networking app is like a lifeline for those who need her assistance, said Peng, because all
their support groups are on WeChat and it is the only Chinese language communication app available in the US.
"I think the WeChat ban is targeting our Chinese communities. It's used to continue the government's racist
agenda," Peng said.
She has since joined organizing efforts to raise awareness of anti-Asian racism, such as inviting elected officials
and community members to speak up at online meetings and signing petitions to protest anti-China rhetoric.
During a recent phone call, Simon told me he would stay and continue his study in the US, despite the pandemic
and other challenges.
"As they say, a crisis brings out both the best and the worst in people. I'm glad to see there also are a lot of
people who believe in equality and stand against racism," he said.
