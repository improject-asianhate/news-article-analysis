Abstract

Days before a shooting in Atlanta that left eight people dead, six of them Asian women, Asian American and Pacific Islander women sounded the alarm in Indiana.
"This is something people need to recognize," Ariana Cavallini said. "These hate incidents, this white supremacy is hurting us. It's happening across the country and it's happening locally to Asian Americans."
A suspect was arrested and charged with murder and assault after shootings at three Atlanta-area spas on Tuesday.
Local law enforcement stated the suspect has said his alleged actions were not motivated by race, but anti-Asian harassment and hate crimes have surged to more than 3,000 nation-wide in the past year. The incidents are tied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic and many were violent.
These events have ignited some Asian Hoosiers, many of whom have long felt invisible and not heard, to speak out and advocate on behalf of others in their community about the discrimination and racism Asians are facing and have been facing for years.
And they want Indiana Governor Eric Holcomb to act.
"It's unfortunate that it had to take death and murder," Cavallini said, "for people to start listening to us."
The 24-year-old Filipino American Hoosier is a member of the Indiana Chapter of the National Asian Pacific Islander Women's Forum (NAPAWF), a group based in Indianapolis and Bloomington founded last year to meet the needs of Asian American and Pacific Islander women, girls, and the community.
The group, which also locally and nation-wide works to make an impact on public policy to drive systemic change, gathered nearly 2,000 signatures in a petition from Asian Hoosiers, community leaders and allies asking Holcomb to establish an Asian American and Pacific Islander statewide advisory committee that can help address issues such as racism, discrimination, language access, health care resources and legal help, among others.
The petition, which was delivered to the governor on March 11, also asks Holcomb to implement programs and resources to support the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities in Indiana without escalating law enforcement and to condemn these hate crimes publicly.
As of Thursday, the group had not gotten a response from the governor's office on the petition or guidance about how to move forward with an advisory committee.
On Wednesday, during a weekly COVID-19 press conference Holcomb spoke on anti-Asian hate crimes after a journalist asked him what he thought about the incident in Atlanta and the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes but he didn't address the petition.
"There is no place for it," he said. "Not just in Indiana, but in the country."
Anti-Asian hate crimes
In an emailed statement to IndyStar, Holcomb referenced Indiana's hate crimes bill, which he signed in 2019. The bill allows judges to consider bias when handing down criminal sentences based on a victim's real or perceived traits. That includes skin color, creed, disability, national origin, race, religion and sexual orientation.
The bill excludes gender, gender identity and age.
"Anyone that seeks to terrorize or cause fear needs to be held accountable for that. Racism is counter to Hoosier values. It's not what we stand for," he said in the statement. "There is no higher priority than the safety and security of Hoosiers."
Nationwide Asian women are targets of anti-Asian racism more often than men. According to a report by Stop AAPI Hate, women made up 68% of the reports, compared to men, who made up 29%.
Although there's no data yet available about the total of anti-Asian harassment incidents in Indiana, according to NAPAWF, some incidents have been documented in Plymouth, Chesterton, Martinsville and Mooresville.
The Anti-Defamation League tracked increases in white supremacist hate propaganda activity. In 2020, 57 such incidents were reported in Indiana, which is a 24% increase from 46 incidents in 2019.
'We are not OK'
Sunny Shuai, 44, said Asian Hoosiers have been scared to go out in public since the pandemic started due to the rise in discrimination.
Shuai immigrated from China and has been calling Indiana home for more than two decades.
"People tend to think that we're fine, that Asians are fine because we tend to stay quiet because we don't speak up as often as others, but we are not OK," she said. "We have lived in fear for so long. We love the United States, this is our home but now we don't feel safe."
Some Asian Hoosiers believe more outreach from elected officials and law enforcement is needed to build trust and prevent more fear from spreading in the community
Liz Prevot, 35, of Greenwood said Asian Hoosiers deserve to feel protected.
"As we watch these hate crimes go up, not only an advisory council is needed but we should be able to get to know our police officers and to understand what our rights are," Prevot said. "We should be able to trust our police officers and we need to be working with them."
According to Census data, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 4% of Marion County's population and Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander Hoosiers make up less than 1%.
The population has grown in some Indianapolis suburbs and surrounding counties.
Asian Hoosiers make up 6% of Hamilton County's population, 7% of Monroe County's and 4% of Johnson County's population.
Statewide, Asian Hoosiers make up nearly 3% of the population. And according to the Migration Policy Institute, 34% of immigrants living in Indiana in 2019 were Asian.
Gurinder Hohl, who is the CEO of the Immigrant Welcome Center in Indianapolis, said there's a lack of awareness in the community about the injustice Asian Americans have faced through the years.
"The systemic racism that exists in our country needs to be addressed," Hohl said. "We need to acknowledge that, and we need to keep telling the stories of these injustices the Asian communities are facing."
Acknowledging the contributions of immigrants and Asian American and Pacific Islander Hoosiers could be a step forward, she said.
"We need to have conversations in the community," Hohl said, "and create a space where they feel welcome and that's where elected officials can play a big role."
