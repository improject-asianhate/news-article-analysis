A University of Arizona research team documented 34 Asian students' experiences facing discrimination during
the pandemic last year, and it wants to hear from more UA Asian students.
Five interdisciplinary UA doctoral students with diverse Asian backgrounds — Kiera Midori Coulter, Jared Joshua
Anucha Barnett, Raynimol Thomas, Sei Eun Kim and Zhenqiang Zhao — noticed the national trend of Asian
discrimination and hate crimes on the news and social media last summer. Some of them had faced
discrimination as well.
"We started to talk about what we, as social scientists, can do something for our community?" one of the
researchers, Zhenqiang Zhao, told The Arizona Republic.
Having known each other for a long time, the five students decided to do a research project on the issue.
The purpose of the project was to learn about the experiences of Asian students, specifically East and Southeast
Asian students, at UA during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the project's consent form.
Some harassment stems from the origins of the 2019 new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, first identified
that year in Wuhan, China.
This study sought to understand how Asian students perceived and experienced anti-Asian discrimination related

to COVID-19, the potential impacts of anti-Asian discrimination on ethnic identity, and how anti-Asian
discrimination related to activism, the form said.
Student: 'He said scum bucket China boy here to take our
checks and then spat on me'
After collecting data in October and November 2020, the team presented its preliminary analysis in an online
meeting hosted by the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth, and Families on March 4.
The FMI serves as a catalyst for cross-disciplinary research on children, youth and families at the University of
Arizona, according to the institute's Facebook page.
In its preliminary analysis, the team identified three types of anti-Asian discrimination that Asian students
experienced due to the pandemic: vicarious (indirect) discrimination, overt (direct) discrimination and
ambiguous discrimination, Zhao said.
In the presentation, the team provided quotes from the student participants about their experiences.
One participant said he had a couple of experiences when going to the lab, according to the presentation.
"So I have to take the public transportation and when I go pass along the bus stops. Some, some guy. I did not
look at him. He said scum bucket China boy here to take our checks and then spat on me and I'm like okay and
I just kept walking," the participant said, according to the presentation.
The student participants were not identified by the research team or by The Republic because they have been
targets of harassment.
"They use some profanity and they're like all the Chinese are here to kill us," another participant said.
The team also found physical aversions against Asian people.
A freshman at the University of Arizona experienced physical aversions when the person was in high school,
lived in Chandler, and worked in the drive-thru at a fast-food chain restaurant, according to the presentation.
"I had a customer not want to be served by me," the freshman said, according to the presentation. "They want
to be served by someone else when they came to the window."
The worker told their manager who took care of the situation by telling the customer they couldn't serve them
anymore, according to the presentation.
The team defined indirect discrimination as hearing about or seeing another person's experiences of racism via
the news media or social media, or an experience reported by family members or friends that may or may not
be witnessed by the participants, Zhao explained in the presentation.
"I have a friend who worked at a cafe and she also had a similar experience where a customer came up to her
and asked her if she was from China and my friend said yes. And he started saying, you know, you know, go
back to China and things like that. Basically blaming her for the pandemic," another participant said.
Another participant said they were asked "where are you from" more often than before the pandemic. "But I feel
a little uncomfortable because it seems they, the person, asked me vaguely if you brought a virus from China,"
the participant said.
The team learned that Asian and Asian American students are aware of the hostile and discriminatory social

contexts that have made them more cautious in their daily lives, Sei Eun Kim explained in the presentation.
Given that the study took place in Phoenix and Tucson, the research team highlighted the need for research
from Asian and Asian Americans in rural areas during these times, Kim said.
Support sought for Asian students during the in-person fall semester
The University of Arizona announced on March 9 its plans to return to majority in-person learning for the fall
semester.
Hopefully, the team members have their perspectives, voices and thoughts organized and unified at the UA,
"so that in the transition to the fall semester, Asian Americans and Asian students will feel that they have
resources and support, and that there are followers who are doing this research that can actually boost their
confidence and their sense of unity and comfort," Kim said.
Zhao said he hopes the college and its departments can be ready for these kinds of issues for Asian people in
the fall semester.
"Our ultimate goal or final goal is that we really want Asian Americans' and other Asian students' voices to be
heard by society or by the campus, by the college," Zhao said. "And we can get the support from the
department, from the school, and from each other."
UA Asian students (both international and domestic students) who have lived in the U.S. during the pandemic
and are willing to participate in the research can visit http://tiny.cc/asianvoice to complete the survey. Eligible
candidates will be contacted by the research team.
Universities say no
documented anti-Asian
incidents since March 2020
Police departments for Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University and University of Arizona told
The Republic that they did not have documented anti-Asian incidents or hate crimes since the start of the
pandemic in March 2020.
"I have not heard of any anti-Asian discrimination at U of A since the pandemic started," Sgt. Sean Shields, of
the University of Arizona Police Department, told The Republic.
The Phoenix Police Department and Maricopa County Sheriff's Office did not respond to The Republic's inquiry
about anti-Asian incidents since March 2020.
The FBI said it will use all authority granted to it by federal law to investigate and hold those who commit
violent acts accountable for their actions, FBI spokesperson Jill McCabe said.
"We want to remind everyone that any violent criminal act against any person because of their race, ethnicity
or national origin is a hate crime. This includes violence toward Asian Americans or individuals from East
Asian countries," McCabe said in an email to The Republic.
