Who gets to decide what is racism, hate? 
Eight people, six of them women of Asian descent, were killed Tuesday in three shootings at Atlanta-area spas before police arrested Robert Aaron Long, 21, a white man, and charged him with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault. For many, the killings were clear acts of racism – yet the notion drew pushback from authorities and critics on social media, writes USA TODAY's Marc Ramirez. For some, the situation echoes a history of moments when others’ perceived racist experiences were downplayed and dismissed by detractors who called such concerns overblown or too emotional. “Those in power – and in this case, those who are white and male – maintain their power partly by determining and defining what constitutes violations of these rules,” said Charissa Cheah, a psychology professor at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. "What we are seeing is a key characteristic of institutional and systemic racism and misogyny.”
The victims in the Georgia shootings included a small-business owner, an Army veteran and a wife on a date with her husband. Some of the victims' names had not been released as of Thursday afternoon; others were identified as Xiaojie Tan, 49, Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, Paul Andre Michels, 54, and Daoyou Feng, 44. 
Asian women lived in fear – long before the shootings Tuesday night that showed America the brutality of anti-Asian violence.

Do you know this person? The FBI wants to know
The FBI seeks help in identifying 10 suspects allegedly involved in assaults on police officers during the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Assistant Director Steven D'Antuono said the suspects were drawn from videos showing rioters wielding clubs, flagpoles, furniture pieces, stolen police shields and chemical spray as they stormed undermanned officer lines outside the Capitol. Others are shown in hand-to-hand combat. "Our work is far from over," D'Antuono said in a video appeal. "We need the help of the American people." Of the more than 300 people arrested, D'Antuono said, at least 65 have been charged with assaulting officers, but "some of the most violent offenders have yet to be identified."

NAACP to NFL: Don't fund Fox News
The NAACP sent a letter to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell asking the league not to allow Fox to use it as a bargaining tool during upcoming rights fees negotiations, and thus help fund Fox News. The NAACP called the network "a uniquely destructive force" that "foments racism, undermines public health recovery from the pandemic, and repeatedly attacks the legitimacy of last year’s Presidential election." The letter, sent March 9 and obtained by USA TODAY Sports, says in part that "the NFL’s programming should not be used as a bargaining tool for Rupert Murdoch to help fund Fox News’ hatred, bigotry, lies and racism." The NFL did not immediately return a request for comment; however, the league announced a mega-deal Thursday afternoon with television partners CBS, Fox, NBC and ESPN/ABC.

The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is safe, Europe regulator says
Europe's top medicines regulator said Thursday the AstraZeneca-Oxford University COVID-19 vaccine is safe and should be delivered across Europe and elsewhere. A number of countries, including Germany, France and Italy, paused on giving the AstraZeneca vaccine amid reports of unusual blood clots in several people among the 18 million who have received at least one dose. The vaccine is not available in the USA, where a large-scale study has been finished but not made public. The United States is finalizing efforts to send a combined 4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Mexico and Canada in its first export of shots. Millions of doses have been stockpiled in the USA, in case it receives emergency use authorization, sparking an international outcry that lifesaving doses were being withheld when they could be used elsewhere.
More than 15% of U.S. adults are fully vaccinated, and 28% have had at least one dose, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says.
