Police have arrested a suspect and charged him with a hate crime for punching an Asian woman unprovoked on a Manhattan street, New York Daily News reports.
Authorities arrested 47-year-old Vincent Diehl on Tuesday, August 24. They charged Diehl with assault as a hate crime and aggravated harassment.
Diehl is accused of punching a 52-year-old Asian woman near the intersection of First Avenue and East 18th Street in Stuyvesant Town around 1:30 p.m. on Sunday,
August 22, MEAWW reports.
Diehl allegedly ran up to the woman and punched her in the head.
"Get the f-k out of here," he is said to have screamed, according to the New York Daily News. "Go back to your country."
The victim received medical treatment at the scene. She was not hurt badly.
Diehl's arraignment was pending in Manhattan Criminal Court on Wednesday.
