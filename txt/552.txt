A pregnant Asian woman says that a man spat at her and her husband while they were sitting in traffic. She alleges that the man also used explicit language, SF Gate
reports.
Tina and her husband were sitting in her car on 14th Street near Broadway in Downtown Oakland Friday morning when a man approached, KPIX reports. She says the
man spat in her face and yelled expletives at her.
"The car window wouldn't go as fast as we expected so by the time he got close to me, he had already spat in the car, and on my face, and taunting us to get out the car
to fight him," Tina told KPIX. "It's in my eyes, on my lips, it wasn't a pretty sight."
Tina took a COVID-19 test after the incident and says she plans to take another one. She told KPIX she believes the attack is racially motivated.
"If you look at the video, I think he had already targeted our car, because he was walking straight towards our car," she said. "Our windows (were) down, there were
other people on the streets, he didn't provoke anyone."
