Living amid a pandemic is enough to make all of us afraid. No one today, at least no one with any sense, can enjoy freedom from fear. Some of us have more reason to fear
than others. Think of our doctors and nurses, our sick and elderly. Think of our fellow citizens who have lost their livelihoods. Then think about those who have become visible
scapegoats for our predicament.
On Wednesday, a group of prominent Chinese Australians issued an open letter warning that national unity was at risk. According to the group, which includes former Australian
of the Year John Yu, writer Benjamin Law and chef Adam Liaw, "the recent rise in anti-Chinese sentiment is driving a marked escalation in racial abuse against Asian
Australians".
There is growing evidence of a deterioration. The Australian Human Rights Commission has recorded a spike in racial discrimination complaints. There are reports across the
country of Asian Australians experiencing verbal abuse, evictions, even physical attacks. In Sydney this week, a man was charged with intimidation after cracking a whip and
threatening people outside the Chinese consulate.
Minorities rarely fare well during pandemics. In the current case, Chinese and Asian Australians were almost certain to be targeted for backlash. For the virus did originate in
Wuhan, China. The Chinese government did fail to respond quickly enough to the outbreak.
But these aren't reasons to be vilifying or targeting anyone who looks Chinese. And they're far from good reasons to be calling COVID-19 "the Chinese virus", as Donald Trump
and others have christened it. Viruses don't have ethnic or racial characteristics. So far, mainstream Australian political leaders have avoided Trumpian excess. But why, then,
has anti-Chinese sentiment appeared nonetheless to grow?
Discrimination always arises from existing anxieties and prejudices. And for some time now, anti-Chinese sentiment has been brewing. Often running alongside concerns about
Chinese Communist Party "fifth columnists", there is unease about Chinese buyers outbidding locals at home auctions, or acquiring agricultural land.
It's fertile ground for anger to sprout. Consider the outrage over the panic hoarding of goods, including by supposed busloads of shopping "tourists" encroaching on
supermarkets in regional towns. The absence of evidence hasn't prevented the wide circulation of stories about Asian tourist buses launching sinister raids. Perhaps it's because
they fit neatly into existing narratives, built on suspicion.
Things could get worse. The likelihood of further economic pain and prolonged physical isolation may see prejudice and anger fester.
Yet racism poses a threat to the solidarity needed right now. As the American political scientist Francis Fukuyama has highlighted, the countries faring best in dealing with the
coronavirus are characterised by trust. What matters is "whether citizens trust their leaders, and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state".
Case in point: the US, where the human disaster is measured in deaths rapidly mounting by the thousands. The Trump administration has succeeded only in sowing a distrust of
government usually found in failed states.
The task at hand isn't just about meeting the immediate health and economic threat of the pandemic. It's also about ensuring we come out of the crisis the right way.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has to date spoken about our society and economy going into a period of hibernation. And in his speech to Parliament on Wednesday, he spoke
about "defending and protecting Australia's national sovereignty".
However, will we ever return to what we knew as normal? In politics, a Coalition government is acting (at least temporarily) like a social democratic one, having introduced a
massive stimulus package. Beyond politics, in work and in society, many of the old rules may no longer exist.
It's still too soon to know, but our pandemic response may end up less of a hibernation, and more of a transition. History shows that crises are often moments for transforming
society. Rather than merely a challenge of national defence, as the PM suggests, this pandemic also presents one of reconstruction.
Having pulled up the drawbridge for now, there's a risk of our national sentiment becoming too insular, too defensive. What's needed isn't so much a rallying cry of sovereignty,
but of nation-building. If we need trust, it's not only trust in government, it's trust among citizens.
The kind of nation we rebuild - the kind of social contract we re-enact - will be determined not just by government, but by us as citizens. In these extraordinary times, almost all
our lives have grown more ordinary. The little things, the gestures and exchanges between us, have taken on new meaning. All the more reason to stamp out the racism, often
