Mira Yusef was flooded with terror, anger, frustration and grief as she watched from her Des Moines home while the news of Tuesday's shooting rampage in Atlanta unfolded.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, of Woodstock, Georgia, is accused of opening fire at three spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight people – most of whom were Asian women. Authorities identified the victims on Friday as Soon C. Park, Hyun Jung Grant, Suncha Kim, Yong A. Yue, Delaina Ashley Yaun, Paul Andre Michels, Xiaojie Tan and Daoyou Feng.
Atlanta police say it's too soon to label the killings as a hate crime, despite a national outcry to do so from experts, activists and Asian Americans across the country.
While Long claimed the killings were motivated by a self-proclaimed sex addiction, many Asians and Pacific Islanders nationwide, including here in Iowa, have pointed to the carnage as yet another example of a rise in violent attacks against Asian Americans. They view the attacks as fueled by racism and xenophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic and anti-China rhetoric conveyed by former President Donald Trump and other prominent conservatives.
In Iowa, recent reports of anti-Asian racism have mainly taken the form of increased microaggressions against people perceived to be from China, where the initial outbreak of COVID-19 was first disclosed in January 2020. But Tuesday's killings were not the first time Yusef, who is Filipina, has had to join in collectively grieving a violent attack against her community.
Yusef said Thursday that, while the increase of violence against Asians and Pacific Islanders is "terrifying," it's worth noting that racism against those groups is nothing new. Rather, the increase in anti-Asian attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic has only highlighted deeply rooted historical and transnational racism against Asians and Pacific Islanders and violence against Asian women, she said.
Yusef cited many examples, including the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882; American colonialism in Asian countries; domestic and sexual violence due to harmful, hypersexual stereotypes of "docile, submissive" Asian women; and, during the pandemic, the stabbing of three members of an Asian American family – including two small children – in Texas because the suspect thought they were "Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus," according to an FBI intelligence report.
"There is a lack of analysis – we cannot forget that anti-Asian sentiment is also deeply connected with anti-Blackness, xenophobia, white supremacy," said Yusef, co-founder of the Des Moines-based organization Monsoon Asians and Pacific Islanders in Solidarity.
"If (authorities) will just say, 'he is a sex addict or he had a bad day,' then we ignore the right questions: Why would he choose a massage parlor with low-wage Asian women employees? As Asian women, we are seen as invisible, submissive. It's like we're nothing."
Advocates: Microaggressions, racist attacks against Asian Iowans under-reported
Just one month into the pandemic, Iowa's Asians and Pacific Islanders were already sharing stories among each other, and publicly, of increased racism against their communities and a growing fear of anti-Asian violence both locally and nationally.
Asian Iowans previously shared with the Register information about microaggressions they had experienced. Some examples appeared explicit and included individuals being yelled at with "coronavirus," a white couple leaving a grocery line to avoid standing next to an Asian American mother buying a birthday cake for her son, and a white woman leaving a Chinese restaurant after asking the owners if they were Chinese.
Other examples were more subtle, such as tense looks or stares.
In 2019, there were 29,370 Asians and Pacific Islanders in the Des Moines metro area, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, or 4.2% of the population. That was up from 3.7% in 2015.
In 2017, 2.6% of Iowa's total population was Asian, according to the State Data Center, with Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City having the largest numbers. That percentage is projected to grow to 4.4% by 2050, the center reported.
Nu Huynh, executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance, has been keeping tabs on potential racism and xenophobia tied to COVID-19 with an online form people can fill out for complaints. Since the start of the pandemic, she has been encouraging the community to report any type of racism or xenophobia, from microaggressions to violent attacks.
So far, she's received only a handful of complaints, Huynh said, the most violent being an egg thrown at an Asian Iowan.
"We just have been very fortunate here in Iowa that we have not seen the level of violence that we are seeing around the world," Huynh told the Register, acknowledging that it's possible there could be attacks and microaggressions that haven't been reported.
Des Moines police data shows that aggravated assaults against Asian victims decreased from 33 incidents in 2019 to 24 in 2020. The Des Moines Police Department was still compiling data of other crimes against Asians, including harassment, as of Thursday night.
Last year, the Iowa Civil Rights Commission took nine discrimination complaints from Iowans who identify as Asian. None has been filed in 2021.
"There's probably a lot of people that are experiencing (racism and xenophobia), but they're not saying anything," Huynh said. Obstacles to filing reports include fear of retaliation and victims not believing that will make a difference, she said.
Nationally, more than 3,800 incidents of racism and xenophobia against Asians and Pacific Islanders were recorded between March 2020 and February by Stop AAPI Hate, a San Francisco-based reporting center.
The majority of discrimination reported involved verbal harassment and shunning, according to a Stop AAPI Hate report, which found that discrimination mostly occurred at businesses, followed by public streets.
Further, the report indicates, women reported hate incidents 2.3 times more than men.
'The solidarity shown
has been beautiful'
Despite the terror and grief, Yusef said that, in Des Moines, the "solidarity shown has been beautiful" in response to the Atlanta killings and increased concerns about racism and xenophobia against Asians and Pacific Islanders.
Apart from the community reaching out and checking in on her, Yusef said her organization, Monsoon Asians and Pacific Islanders, has received many donations, which she plans to send directly to the victims' families and coworkers.
Organizations such as the NAACP of Des Moines have released statements in solidarity, as well.
Additionally, Huynh has said she's seen a lot of solidarity both in business partnerships and in rallying the community to support Asian and Pacific Islander businesses in Iowa.
Lucky Lotus, which serves Laotian, Vietnamese and Chinese specialties in Des Moines' Woodland Heights neighborhood, announced Thursday morning that the restaurant plans to donate 25% of its proceeds through the end of the week to the Iowa Asian Alliance.
"We lead with love and kindness, but we cannot stay silent. Uniting Asian, Asian American, and Pacific Islander communities to foster growth and development will lead to a more vibrant and prosperous community, which we believe will in turn help prevent violent acts of hate from corrupting the most vulnerable in our neighborhoods," the restaurant wrote in a statement.
And on Saturday, the community will come together for a vigil from noon to 4 p.m. at the Pappajohn Sculpture Park to remember the lives of the eight killed in Atlanta, as well as to pay respect to other Asians and Pacific Islanders who have experienced racism and xenophobia.
