The recent horrendous fatal shooting of eight people - six of them of Asian descent - was yet another senseless killing by an American man who hated women and, in
particular, Asian women. This horrific crime was stretched to nearly one hour at three different Atlanta adult parlours, resulting in targeted hatred toward mostly Asian
women.
The audacious Cherokee County Sheriff's Office's Capt. Jay Baker's synopsis of the killer's actions was: "He was pretty much fed up and kind of at the end of his rope.
Yesterday was a really bad day for him, and this is what he did." The loss of eight innocent lives relegated to this evil criminal carnage to "a bad day" is perturbing.
As painful as it was to hear these comments from the sheriff, internet sleuths and journalists found Baker's Facebook posts promoting shirts that called COVID-19 an
"IMPORTED VIRUS FROM CHY-NA."
With the rhetoric coming from the U.S. during this COVID era, there has been an increase in Asian hate incidents in Canada. According to Project 1907, a grassroots
group made up of Asian women that collects data on incidents of racism, hate, and violence experienced by the Asian diaspora in Canada:
Canada has a higher number of anti-Asian racism reports per Asian capita than the United States;
Women are impacted the most, reporting six per cent of all incidents;
In B.C., women are even more disproportionately impacted, accounting for nearly 70 per cent of all reported incidents;
Verbal abuse and harassment are widespread, occurring in 65 per cent of all reported incidents;
Nearly 30 per cent of reported incidents are assault, including targeted coughing, spitting and physical attacks and violence.
According to a report released by the Vancouver Police Department, there has been a 717 per cent increase in anti-Asian hate crimes from 2019 to 2020. On April 3, Fight
COVID Racism reported 980 incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes across Canada during the pandemic.
According to 2016 Statistics Canada, approximately 1,400 people of Asian descent live in Peterborough, and during this COVID pandemic, they have been feeling the
effects of anti-Asian racism. Their racist incidents have been more subtle, a microaggression, "feeling of being watched" or "getting a look," the feeling of "what are you
doing here," or "you don't belong here."
During this COVID-19 era, members of an Asian family who have lived in Peterborough for a few years were celebrating their child's birthday party. For the first time since
living in Peterborough, a stranger yelled, "Go back to China."
Not all Asians are from China, and they are not a monolithic ethnic group.
The diversity among Asians is vast and varied like any other ethnic group. The ignorance of people, allied with the philosophy of Trumpism, has given rise to the anti-Asian
racism. Their narrative may also include references to the Chinese Communist political system and Chinese oligarchy. These detrimental opinions are red herrings and
should have no place within the context of anti-Asian racism.
Instead, we need to stop this cycle of hate toward those who are different from ourselves. Stop the labelling of others, eliminate the negative stereotypes; stop the
microaggressions! We need to come together in solidarity and break the exclusivity barriers to create a supportive, welcoming, caring society - one where we are all
treated with dignity, respect, and equity as human beings.
We need to move beyond our statements, Black Lives Matter, Stop Asian Hate; we need to take a stand and be bold. These actions can range from checking in with your
Asian friends on their well-being. Are they feeling safe in our community? Listening to other racialized groups, hearing their narratives, educating yourselves, being bold
and taking a stand against hate.
Even small acts of kindness give us hope, energy, and the opportunity for conversations. As Peterboroughians, reach out and make this community a place that treats all
citizens regardless of a person's demographic: race, gender, religion, gender orientation, ethnic group, social-economic status, or ability/disability as one with equity.
Here's how you can make a difference.
