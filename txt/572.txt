Full Text The recent rise in anti-Asian hate crimes are horrific and heartbreaking, but also just the latest instance of anti-
Asian hate in our country.
In the past month alone, stories of hate crimes and racist language against Asian-Americans have become
commonplace on social media and news outlets. These attacks don't just harm their victims, they also harm the
mental and physical health of Asian-Americans and all Americans.
As an Asian-American physician, I would know.
Of the 2,000 students who attended my high school in Omaha, Nebraska, there were a total of seven or eight
Asians in the whole school - amid only 12 students of color. I felt the pressure of wanting to fit in - of wanting to
be white - and that pressure of course took a toll on my well-being.
The numerous instances of anti-Asian racism we experience - from seemingly less serious jokes about our eyes;
to having, "Go back to [insert wrong country here]!" yelled at us; to being the victim of or witness to physical
attacks - have dire consequences for our health. Trauma after trauma compounds, and racist barriers to health
care make it even harder to treat.
But it's not just Asian-Americans who are harmed by these racist actions, it's all of us.
Take, for example, the Asian hate enabled by many during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are all tired of the
pandemic: having to quarantine, avoid loved ones, and wear a mask all the time bothers us - it's only human.
When our lives are interrupted and filled with worry and frustration, we're faced with a decision about how to
move forward. Unfortunately, in American history, it's been common for some to spiral into negativity and seek
someone to blame - as we've seen with Japanese internment camps, McCarthyism and Islamophobia following
9/11.
Like a nervous athlete who gets inside his or her head and 'chokes', some people make a worried situation
worse by becoming negative and hateful contributing to the heavy mental and physical burden already carried by
Asian Americans.
But think also of where we could be as a nation had those Americans channeled their energy into eradicating the
pandemic and easing the economic burden it caused.
Nervous athletes don't have to choke - with the right mindset they can use this energy to instead have
sometimes unbelievable performances - when you hear of an athlete "in the zone," this is what they mean.
If we want to be stronger - if we all want to be healthier and happier - we have to learn how to channel our
energy not into hate, racism, or blame, but into positive solutions.
