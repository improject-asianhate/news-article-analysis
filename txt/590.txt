The Orange County Human Relations Commission found a 19-fold increase in attacks against Asians Americans, reports the Los Angeles Times.
The findings analyzing attacks in 2020 mirrors a statewide report which found a 107% increase in hate incidents against Asians.
"When there are spikes, when there are increases, we have seen an increase locally for anti-Asian hate," Mary Anne Foo, executive director of the
Orange County Asian Pacific Islander Community Alliance, said to the Voice of OC.
Foo says part of the spike can be blamed not only on the pandemic, but the rising anti-China sentiment in national and international politics.
Supervisor Katrina Foley says this sentiment is also reflected in comments made by the public during Board of Supervisor meetings.
"We hear speakers that, in my opinion, that are often making comments that are truly bigoted and connecting COVID with communism," Foley said. "The
public health response to COVID is somehow related to communism and tying it to China. It's very sad to see that happening. I know that [OC Health
Officer Dr. Clayton Chau] has taken the brunt of it, (Board) Chairman [Andrew] Do as well."
Do told As AmNews back in July that he's faced racism during his entire six years on the board, but it has increased of late.
"I think the the language coming from the last administration stoked that fire, legitimized the fringe elements to come out, and and if anything, feel more
legitimate," said Do who is a Republican. "They feel like, hey, maybe these racist thoughts that I have are not so out of the ordinary, if people at the very
top talk the way I do." ProQuest document 1 of 1 Full Text | Newspaper Orange County sees 19 fold increase in anti - Asian hate crimes Randall . ( 2021 , Sep 18 ) .

coordinator for the Orange County Human Relations Commission.
