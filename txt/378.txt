At least two Lehigh Valley colleges have issued statements of support for members of the Asian, Asian American
and Pacific Islander communities as instances of harassment and violence against them increase during the
coronavirus pandemic.
In a letter sent to students and staff Wednesday, Lafayette College officials denounced "all such racially
motivated and xenophobic acts of harassment and violence" and urged members of the community to stand in
solidarity with those on the receiving end of it.
Last week, Muhlenberg College President Kathleen Harring sent a similar letter to students and staff, saying the
"rise in physical violence against Asian Americans is alarming and compounds the issues of inequity felt among
Asian American communities during the pandemic."
"Our Asian students, faculty and staff are struggling with the insidious anti-Asian hate that continues to pervade
society - both nearby and around the world," Harring said. "Muhlenberg condemns all forms of racism and
stands in solidarity with our Asian American, Asian and Pacific Islander community members. We support them
with steadfast resolve."
Researchers have seen a marked uptick in racist attacks against Asians and Asian Americans during the
pandemic, attributed at least in part to former President Donald Trump's habit of blaming China for spreading
the coronavirus.

Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit that tracks incidents of discrimination, hate and xenophobia against Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders in the U.S., has received nearly 3,000 hate-incident reports across the country
since the start of the pandemic.
A report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino,
showed anti-Asian hate crimes surged 149% in 2020, "with the first spike occurring in March and April amidst a
rise in COVID cases and negative stereotyping of Asians relating to the pandemic."
In the letter, Lafayette officials called on the community to make sure students and staff feel safe at the school.
"Reach out to students, faculty, and staff to ask about their well-being and offer assistance, interrupt any hateful
speech or behavior, and report an incident of bias if you hear of or witness one," according to the letter.
Students who have experienced any acts of harassment or bias can reach out to seek support, contact the
Counseling Center for assistance or report it.
"Prejudice, discrimination, and violence against any one of us is prejudice, discrimination, and violence against
all of us," the letter ends.
