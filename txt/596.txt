UW-Madison Police arrested a man on a tentative charge of disorderly conduct with a hate crime enhancer after he allegedly spit on and made comments about COVID-19
to an Asian-American student last month.
Morgan R. Kroll, 37, of Madison, was arrested Monday and appeared in court Thursday, police spokesperson Marc Lovicott said. UW-Madison Police identified Kroll through
security cameras and with the assistance of the Madison Police Department.
Kroll, who is not affiliated with UW-Madison, is now banned from the campus as part of his court-ordered bail conditions. A phone message left with Kroll's attorney, Jason
Gonzalez, was not returned Friday.
The student told police she was walking on West Dayton Street near Ogg Hall shortly before 10 p.m. on Sept. 15 when a man approached her, spat in her face and made
statements about COVID-19. She told investigators she felt targeted because of her race and appearance.
Racist, anti-Chinese graffiti appeared on the UW-Madison campus at the beginning of the pandemic. One message said, "It's from China #CHINESEVIRUS," mirroring
language used by President Donald Trump despite the World Health Organization going out of its way to avoid including people or places when naming the disease.
University officials denounced behavior blaming China for COVID-19 and held a town hall for students in March 2020. They said at the time that 82 bias incident reports
had been filed so far in the spring 2020 semester, more than half of which involved discrimination toward Asian or international students.
About 20% of the university's student body identify as Asian or come from overseas, according to UW-Madison data.
