New York City police have arrested and charged the suspect wanted in the attack of an Asian woman near Time Square, ABC 6 reports.
On Monday, March 29, a surveillance video of a man kicking and stomping on an Asian woman as she walked to church surfaced. Police have now identified the man as 38-year-old Brandon Elliot, NBC New York reports.
Thanks to assistance from the public and excellent investigative work by @NYPDHateCrimes Detectives, the individual wanted for Monday’s assault of a 65 year-old Asian female, at 360 West 43rd St, was arrested and charged with Felony Assault as a Hate Crime.
— NYPD Hate Crimes (@NYPDHateCrimes) March 31, 2021 Elliot was arrested and charged with felony assault as a hate crime late Tuesday night. Residents in the area had identified Elliot as a local homeless man, according to ABC 6.
According to an NYPD spokesperson, Elliot had been released from prison in 2019, NBC New York reports. He was serving time for killing his mother 17 years ago.
Elliot will be arraigned on Wednesday, March 31.
The victim, who police sources have identified as Vilma Kari, left the hospital on Tuesday after being treated for serious injuries, according to NBC New York.
