A week after Warner Bros.' international rollout of "Godzilla vs. Kong" set a new pandemic record for a Hollywood film, its North American release continued to hint at a
forthcoming return to the box office with a pandemic-best opening of $48.5 million (U.S.) over five days since its Wednesday debut and $32.2 million this weekend,
according to estimates from measurement firm Comscore.
The previous benchmark for a pandemic-era domestic opening was the debut of "Wonder Woman 1984" in December, with $16.7 million over the three-day Christmas
weekend. "Godzilla vs. Kong," which simultaneously debuted domestically in theatres and on HBO Max, played in 3,064 locations, the most since the pandemic began
more than a year ago. It currently stands at $285.4 million in global receipts.
"The resounding success of 'Godzilla vs. Kong' represents an incredibly important and positive milestone both financially and symbolically for the movie industry," said Paul
Dergarabedian, a senior media analyst at Comscore. "We are seeing that as consumer confidence grows, so too does the ability of movie theatres to generate stronger
box office."
Elsewhere at the box office this weekend, Sony Screen Gems' "The Unholy" opened in 1,850 locations to $3.2 million and Atlas Distribution's "The Girl Who Believes in
Miracles" premiered in 680 locations to $580,068.
Although U.S. theatres are slowly returning after a year of harried reopenings and closings, major theatres including Regal and AMC and smaller chains have not yet
reopened.

Monet exhibit comes to Toronto
Toronto is getting another immersive exhibition dedicated to a famous painter.
"Beyond Monet: The Immersive Experience" is expected to make its world premiere at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre this summer for a limited run.
"People of all ages can be part of every brush stroke as Monet's artwork comes to life in front of their very eyes," a news release says, with music, sound effects and
scenography as part of the experience within a 50,000-square-foot space. French painter Claude Monet (1840 to 1926) was a founder of the Impressionist movement.
"Beyond Monet" was created by Montreal's Normal Studio and is presented by Beyond Exhibitions Inc.
Visitors will be physically distanced with timed-entry tickets to limit capacity.

Nike sues maker of Lil Nas X shoes
Looks like Lil Nas X's "Satan Shoes" collaboration has taken a step too far.
The Hollywood Reporter said fulfilment of orders of the controversial sneaker has stopped after a U.S. District Court in New York approved Nike's request for a temporary
restraining order against Mschf, the Brooklyn-based collective that collaborated with the singer-rapper on the shoes.
Nike sued the collective Monday, alleging trademark infringement, false designation of origin and trademark dilution. The sneakers are based on Nike's Air Max 97, but
with a pentagram pendant and a drop of human blood in every sole.
Lil Nas X, who was not listed as a defendant in the lawsuit, released the sneakers as part of a promotion for his new song "Montero (Call Me by Your Name)."

Arden Cho says she experienced a racist attack in which a man threatened to kill her. The "Teen Wolf" star was walking her dog Wednesday night when the man
screamed "I'm going to motherf---ing kill you c--- and your f---ing dog," she said in an emotional Instagram post. Cho, a second-generation Korean American who also
stars on "Chicago Med," encouraged other people to speak up against anti-Asian racism and violence, which has increased since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic
in March 2020.
Simon Bassett, the character played by Regé-Jean Page, the breakout star of the Netflix series "Bridgerton," will not return for the show's second season, Netflix and
Shondaland, Shonda Rhimes' production company, announced Friday. The news was delivered, appropriately enough, via a missive from Lady Whistledown, the show's
mysterious narrator - and sometimes instigator - of scandal.
DMX's longtime New York-based lawyer, Murray Richman, said the rapper was on life support Saturday evening at White Plains Hospital. "He had a heart attack. He's quite
ill," Richman said. Richman said he could not confirm reports that DMX, 50, overdosed on drugs and was not sure what caused the heart attack. Over the years, DMX has
battled with substance abuse. The rapper cancelled a series of shows to check himself into a rehabilitation facility in 2019. On Instagram, his team said he apologized for
the cancelled shows.
