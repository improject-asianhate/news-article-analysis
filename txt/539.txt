A Brooklyn man was awaiting arraignment on hate-crime charges in three separate anti-Asian attacks in the past month, law-enforcement
officials said Thursday.
Joseph Russo, 27 years old, was arrested Wednesday in the three incidents, including one on March 5 when he allegedly pushed a 64-year-old
Asian-American woman to the ground in the Gravesend section of Brooklyn, New York Police Department officials said.
Mr. Russo is also accused of pulling the hair of a 32-year-old Asian woman on March 22 outside a building in the Homecrest section of the
borough, according to the officials. He also allegedly pushed a 77-year-old Asian man to the ground on April 5 while the man was buying
groceries in the Sheepshead Bay section of the borough, the officials said.
Violence Against Asian-Americans
Video surveillance shows Mr. Russo committing the March 22 and April 5 attacks, according to the officials. Minor injuries were reported in the
incidents, the officials said.
Mr. Russo was awaiting arraignment in criminal court in Brooklyn on Thursday. He was charged with crimes including assault as a hate crime and
aggravated harassment as a hate crime, the officials said.
An attorney for Mr. Russo couldn't be reached for comment.
The alleged attacks come amid a rise in complaints of hate crimes against Asian Americans in New York City and other U.S. cities.
Asians were targeted in 39 New York City hate crimes from Jan. 1 through April 4 of this year, up from 11 in the same period in 2020, according
to the NYPD. The NYPD recorded 28 hate crimes against Asians for 2020, up from three in 2019.
Phil Wong, president of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, a nonprofit volunteer group, said in an interview Thursday
that bias attacks on Asian-Americans and other groups occur regularly in the city. "All New York City residents are entitled to feel safe while
walking in the streets," Mr. Wong said. "Because of all these attacks, not just Asians, but, I think, everyone feels unsafe."
Some of the alleged hate crimes against Asian-Americans in New York City have been motivated by the false belief that Asians are responsible
for the Covid-19 pandemic, according to NYPD officials. The NYPD has responded to the crimes by increasing efforts to investigate and prevent
bias incidents.

undercover officer on Tuesday arrested a woman who began harassing Asian people at a salon in Manhattan, according to police officials.
