What to do about hate crimes increasing in the Bay Area
By Christopher Dolan and Mari 
Bandoma Callado
T
his week’s question from Lin 
S. in Oakland who asks:
Q: It’s been devastating to 
hear about the increase in anti-Asian 
hate incidents and violence against the 
Asian American and Pacific Islander 
community, including attacks on the 
elderly and the recent mass shooting 
in Atlanta. It does not seem like many 
of these incidents are being charged as 
a “hate crime.” What is a “hate crime” 
under the law? What should I do if I 
am a victim of a hate crime or if I wit-
ness a hate crime?
A: The Dolan Law Firm is 
appalled by the increasing displays 
of violence and hate targeting Asian 
Americans and Pacific Islanders, 
including the shootings in Atlanta 
which left eight dead, six of which 
were AAPI women, as well as the 
vicious attacks on elderly AAPI in 
the San Francisco Bay Area over 
the last few weeks. Our deepest 
sympathies go out to the friends 
and family of the victims of these 
horrifying acts of violence. 
Unfortunately, discrimination 
and violence against AAPI com-
munities are not new. The United 
States has a long and well-docu-
mented history of discrimination 
and hate-based incidents against 
AAPI communities. Since the 
arrival of Chinese immigrants as 
laborers in the 1850s, Asian Amer-
icans have always been the subject 
of racist violence. For example, the 
Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 was 
enacted as Asian immigrants were 
viewed as threats, Japanese Amer-
icans were incarcerated during 
World War II, , and Asian Muslims 
and Sikh communities were tar-
geted post-911. At the beginning of 
the COVID-19 pandemic, elected 
officials referred to coronavirus as

the “Chinese virus” or “Kung-Flu,” 
fueling anti-Asian sentiment. While 
hate crimes decreased generally, 
anti-Asian hate incidents surged by 
nearly 150% in 2020. The targets of 
violence have disproportionately 
been older people and women, 
according to a report published by 
Stop AAPI Hate.
California Penal Code section 
422.55 defines a “hate crime” as “a 
criminal act committed because 
of the victim’s actual or perceived 
disability, gender, nationality, race, 
or ethnicity, religion, sexual orien-
tation, or association with a person 
or group with one or more of these 
actual or perceived characteris-
tics.” Hate incidents, on the other 
hand, involve actions or behavior 
motivated by hate, but are legally 
protected by the First Amendment 
right to freedom of expression. This 
includes hate speech, which is often 
intended to intimidate or incite 
violence or discrimination against 
certain groups. The U.S. Constitu-
tion allows hate speech as long as 
it does not interfere with the civil 
rights of others. However, race-
based or anti-LGBTQ slurs can be 
evidence of a hate crime when used 
during a commission of an underly-
ing crime.
California Penal Code section 
422.6 makes it a stand-alone crime 
to willfully interfere, by force or 
threat of violence, with someone 
else’s civil rights, or knowingly 
damage or destroy their property 
because of that person’s actual or 
perceived protected characteris-
tic(s). There are also related civil 
remedies under the Ralph Act and 
Bane Act that can be enforced 
through the civil courts.
If you are a victim or witness of a 
hate crime, dial 911 if it is an emer-
gency and get yourself to safety. 
Second, get medical help if neces-
sary. Third, document details of 
the crime as soon as you can. It will 
be important to note the physical 
appearance of the perpetrator (age, 
height, weight, clothes, gender, race 
and other distinguishing charac-
teristics) and to make notes about 
what happened, including the exact 
words that were said (any racial or 
anti-LGBTQ slurs). If it is safe, save 
potential evidence by taking photos 
and by getting names, phone num-
bers and emails of other victims and 
witnesses.
To report the incident, contact 
your local police department and/
or the FBI to file a report. Make 
sure to get the responding officer’s 
name, badge number and case 
number. We also recommend urg-
ing the police officer to check the 
hate/bias-motivation or hate crime/
incident box on the police report. 
Report the incident to organiza-
tions like Stop AAPI Hate, which 
has been tracking incidents of hate, 
violence, harassment and discrim-
ination against AAPIs since March 
2020.
If you feel you have been a victim 
of a hate crime, contact an attorney 
immediately. The Dolan Law Firm 
is committed to representing vic-
tims of hate crimes, harassment, 
and discrimination that are mem-
bers of the AAPI community and 
other marginalized communities 
statewide.
