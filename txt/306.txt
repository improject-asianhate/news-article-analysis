A 75-year-old Asian man has died after succumbing to injuries sustained from a robbery. The suspect is now
facing special circumstance murder charges.
On Thursday, Alameda County DA Nancy O’Malley filed special circumstances murder and multiple serious felony
charges against Teaunte Bailey, 26, in connection with crimes committed on two different dates in Oakland, CA,
according to a press release.
Bailey allegedly pushed 75-year-old Pak Ho to the ground and robbed him on the morning of March 9 in the
Adams Point neighborhood of Oakland. He fled in his car and was eventually apprehended.
Ho’s head hit the pavement after Bailey shoved him, causing him to sustain a traumatic head injury and brain
damage. He died of his injuries on Thursday.
Bailey is also being charged in connection with a similar crime that occurred February 19 2021. That day he
allegedly broke into a senior living apartment and shoved the 72-year-old victim inside. Police say he stole the
victim’s phone and several other items.
Bailey is being held at Santa Rita jail without bail, according to ABC 7. He is set to be arraigned on Friday, March
12.
