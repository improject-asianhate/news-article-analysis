The new coronavirus is spreading fast around the world and so is racism against Asian people.
TV personality and Korean-American lawyer Suh Dong-joo, 36, lashed out at the increasing number of racially motivated attacks against Koreans and other Asians in the United
States amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
'Do you want us to wear a mask or not wear a mask? I'm getting mixed messages here,' Suh, who lives in San Francisco, wrote on Instagram. 'If Asians get beat up for both
wearing a mask and not, what do you expect us to do?'
The comment comes five days after she posted the photo of herself wearing a face mask, saying she was concerned about growing racism.
Asians see increase in racially motivated attacks against them
As the virus from the Chinese city of Wuhan continues to affect people around the world, concerns have been growing over xenophobic and racist attacks against people
'whoever look Chinese.'
Earlier in February, a video posted on Twitter of a women wearing a mask being punched, kicked and called a 'diseased b****' by a man in a New York City subway went viral.
On Feb. 24, Jonathan Mok, a 23-year-old Singaporean, was attacked while walking down the streets in London by a group of four men who said: 'we don't want your
coronavirus in our country.' The attack resulted in a broken bone near his eye.
On Mar. 6, another disturbing video was widely circulated on social media, in which a black man sprayed Febreeze air freshener at an Asian guy after having an argument on a
New York City train.
