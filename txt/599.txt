Nan Zhang's dream to become a police officer with the Albuquerque Police Department ended when she says a pattern of harassment forced her to resign from the police
academy.
KOB reports she has filed a complaint with the Department of Workforce Solutions alleging discrimination.
According to KOAT, the Department of Justice is also looking into her complaint and could launch its own investigation.
"People kept telling me that you don't belong here," Zhang said to KOAT. "They tell me these things every day. This is harassment. I mean, it's just because of my age, my
language and my race."
In her complaint, she alleges abuse and discrimination and says she was given the nickname "Cadet COVID."
She quotes another cadet as saying "Because of her Chinese accent, she could get herself or one of us killed," according to KOB.
"For Nan, there was no other choice to do this both on behalf of herself and all other you know Asian Americans that are in situations like this, facing discrimination," said
Thomas Grover, who is representing Zhang.
However, the mayor's office says two separate investigations failed to substantiate any of Zhang's claims.
"I really want to become a police officer, honestly," Zhang said. "But I don't think they will accept the people who look like me. Look different. Talk different."
