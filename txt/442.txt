up by 114%.
The first spike in anti-Asian hate crimes started in March and April of last year, when the pandemic began to
send the country into lockdown. In March, the FBI warned of an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans
in light of COVID-19.

The coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 29 million people in the United States, with over 525,000
deaths attributed to the virus.
