Full Text
A new poll conducted in California found a sharp increase in the number of people who agree Asian Americans face discrimination.
The same survey also found Asian Americans, more than any other group, fear being victims of violence.
The poll conducted with the Los Angeles Times by a number of community groups revealed 73% of Asian Americans are afraid of being victims of violence and 68% are
afraid of being bullied, mocked or harassed in public, according to CBS5.
"It's really unfair, I would say, because we're American just like everyone else here," Priscilla Lee said to the San Francisco TV station. "I'm afraid for my grandma. I sent a
voice message to her telling her stay inside please, don't even go out. For my parents too - when my mom goes on a walk I say, 'Don't go by yourself.""
KTLA reports 70% of Californians agree Asian Americans frequently or sometimes face discrimination. That's an increase of 15% over the same questions asked in
February 2020.
Last year 63% of Asian Americans said they were discriminated against. That's now increased to 79%.
The Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment calls the poll results a "profound shift" and an opportunity to build "allyship."
Eric Vien told CBS5 he worries about his mother's safety.
"I always tell her 'be careful,'" Vien said. "We bought her pepper spray just in case too."
