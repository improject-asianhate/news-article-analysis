The latest use of "China virus" and "kung flu" by the US president and some other US leaders is not just a
presidential election year stunt and a desperate bid to deflect public attention from the administration's failure
to timely and appropriately respond to the pandemic, but blatant racism that people should not ignore, let alone
condone.
The US president indulged in racist slurs during his 2016 election campaign, and now with his job approval
rating holding steady at a low level and the picture of the US' response to the novel coronavirus pandemic
looking increasingly bleak, blaming China to distract American public attention has become a strategy for the US
administration ahead of the presidential election scheduled for November.
Gallup polls in the past week showed that only 38 percent of Americans approve of the job the US president has
been doing while a new high of 65 percent of adults in the US say the pandemic situation in the country is
getting worse, contradicting what the US administration claims.
With more than 3 million COVID-19 cases and 131,000 deaths, the US is by far the worst-hit country, which
reflects its poor pandemic control and mitigation response. Many other economies, such as the European Union,
have effectively flattened, even lowered the curve after suffering a heavy blow. Yet the world's only superpower
continues to set single-day records - it registered more than 60,000 new cases on Tuesday.
That's why US politicians have intensified their attacks against China, often using racist language, in campaign

rallies, on TV and social media, in a bid to deflect public criticism.
Sadly, resorting to such racist rhetoric is regarded as a good strategy by some Republicans to appeal to the
voters. The fact that many supporters in campaign rallies cheered the leaders who used racist language should
shock the world, especially after worldwide anti-racism protests sparked by the death of African American
George Floyd due to police brutality in Minnesota on May 25.
The racist slurs relished by top US officials are also partly responsible for the increasing discrimination and
attacks against Asian Americans. A Pew survey released on July 1 showed that about four in 10 US adults say it
has become more common for people to express racist views against Asians since the pandemic broke out.
However, the condemnation of such racist language against Asian Americans is more muted than during the
recent Black Lives Matter movement. Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser with a track record of hate
speech against China, has frequently used lies and racist language in his interviews with US media outlets lately,
but he has often gone unchecked and unchallenged. Which speaks volumes of how media outlets sometimes,
intentionally and unintentionally, spread racism.
MSNBC host Ali Velshi set a good example by quickly contesting Navarro who was peddling his conspiracy theory
last Saturday on a program saying China "spawned the virus" and "they hid the virus. They sent hundreds of
thousands of Chinese nationals over here to seed and spread the virus before we knew". Velshi was quick to
question Navarro: "What are you talking about?"
And in reply to the US president's tweet on Monday that "China has caused great damage to the United States
and the rest of the World!", I tweeted that the whole world knows how incompetent and anti-science he has
been in his response to the outbreak. The tweet received more than half a million views and has been quoted by
several news outlets.
Those US politicians may not stop using xenophobia and racism to advance their political agenda, but at least
sane people across the world should speak out more forcefully against such hate rhetoric, so as to not become
their accomplices.
