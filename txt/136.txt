ASHEVILLE – J Chong had her culinary lesson set. Pesto pasta, made from ingredients she discovered in her
cupboards, would make for a flavorful, accessible meal, one her homebound audience could replicate through their
computer screens.
The Asheville-based Campaign for Southern Equality had invited Chong to lead this free, virtual cooking tutorial for
its The Front Porch series of community webinars. The 42-year-old Chong, who serves on the CSE board, had
already posted a few meal demonstrations on her Instagram during the coronavirus outbreak. Doing another with
CSE seemed like a perfect fit.
"To me, cooking is easy," said Chong, an executive sous chef with Katie Button Restaurants. "But when we're stuck
at home and some are homeschooling and some have kids, cooking can be very stressful. I like to offer some help
to the community."
Minutes before the lesson began on Zoom, a video conferencing platform, Chong received a brief warning from a
CSE staff member: "There may be some people who interrupt the class." Chong didn't give the caution much
concern.
"No biggie," she thought. "If it happens then we will work through it."

Held in the afternoon of March 27, the lesson started seamlessly. Chong's wife, Danielle, filmed and CSE staff
monitored the Zoom video stream, handling any technical difficulties and booting out any unwelcome guests.
Around 10 attendees signed on to watch Chong turn spinach, parmesan, parsley, dill, and some almonds into a
thick pesto sauce.
About half an hour into the lesson, after Chong tossed the sauce with cooked penne and was preparing to take
audience questions, several new accounts flooded in the video stream.
Chong's first thought: "Cool, more people are joining."
Instead, the new entrants began spewing a string of slurs toward Chong. Both verbally and on Zoom's chat feature,
the intruders got off a torrent of anti-Asian and homophobic epithets before CSE staff scrambled to block off all
accounts. While the entire episode lasted around 20 seconds, those listening in said it seemed much longer.
"It felt like forever," said Al Murray, CSE's director of engagement and organizational development. "It was
infuriating. It was heartbreaking. J is an incredible human and just walks through the world with so much kindness.
She is the last person I'd wish this upon."
Chong, for her part, remained stoic. "I am a queer Asian, and those words I've heard all my life," she said. "My wife
told me I didn't flinch while it was happening."
While few words in a xenophobe's vocabulary can shake Chong, one line uttered during her cooking tutorial was
new. Never before had she received the taunt: "The coronavirus is happening because of you."
Anti-Asian hate in the time of COVID-19
The intrusion into J Chong's pesto pasta lesson represented two broad trends of the COVID-19 outbreak: disruptive
video chat "bombings" and growing incidents - both nationally and locally - of discrimination against Asian-
Americans.
Social distancing, working from home, and remote schooling have bolstered the prevalence of video conferencing
services like Zoom. Yet greater use has been accompanied by an uptick in "Zoombombings," as internet
provocateurs around the world coordinate to barge into personal conversations to stir chaos.
At physical and online events, CSE staff said they're always on alert for any unwanted guests wishing to protest the
organization's pro-LGBTQ messages. Still, the planned interruption of Chong's lesson took the monitors by surprise.
"We didn't have any awareness of it," Murray said. "We have been hosting webinars with open attendance
processes in the past and haven't seen anything like this happen."
Alongside "Zoombombings" many anti-Asian incidents have been reported as some accuse China for the virus's
evolution into a global pandemic.
In late March, UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University released statements denouncing coronavirus-linked racism
against Asians.
Ricky Leung of the advocacy group North Carolina Asian Americans Together said his organization has heard from
Asian North Carolinians fearing discrimination. "We've been getting inquiries about it pretty much since February,"
Leung said. "People are just kind of concerned."'
North Carolina is home to one of the fastest growing Asian American populations in the United States. According to
the U.S. Census Bureau, no other racial or ethnicity group in the state has grown as quickly since 2010. Asian
Americans now make up 3.1% of North Carolina's total population with larger communities in Greensboro,
Charlotte, and Raleigh.

In Asheville, Calvin Chu, a self-employed entrepreneur, said his Chinese-American ethnicity still makes him unique.
"I stand out wherever it is that I go in Asheville," he said.
In an April 10 Facebook post, Chu described a recent trip to get his oil changed, revealing his thoughts that the
cold, uneasy reactions he perceived from the staff may have had something to do with his ethnicity.
"I felt a little bit thrown off and frustrated," Chu said.
J Chong believes awareness can help diminish misinformation and fear.
"I think it's very, very important that people know this is happening to Asian Americans right now," said Chong,
who is also of Chinese descent. "All the world is suffering right now. We're all going through this together. It's a
global pandemic. It's just very unfortunate right now that Asian Americans are being targeted. So, it's very
important we talk about it."
Chong's second cooking tutorial
After the CSE monitors banished the "Zoombombers", Chong continued the lesson by fielding culinary questions.
The returning audience, she said, was supportive and shocked.
Al Gregory and other CSE staff regrouped over the following days and researched a more rigorous process to weed
out intruders on future webinars. For future events, those wishing to attend must have a password, RSVP, and then
be placed on a waiting list as CSE staff verify their identifies and intentions. While Gregory said this system should
prevent what happened to Chong from happening again, they acknowledge these added steps come at a cost.
"We don't like having those barriers with people and spaces that are intended to be safe and to help foster
connection," Gregory said.
Immediately following the pesto pasta lesson, CSE asked if Chong would teach another class in the Front Porch
series. She didn't hesitate in her response.
"I'm not one to allow stuff like this to stop me," said Chong, who had detailed her "Zoombombing" experience on
Instagram. "If they asked me to do more, I'll continue doing more."
On the afternoon of April 10, Chong guided a virtual audience of 12 through a Shrimp pasta recipe with a Caesar
salad side. Gregory and their fellow CSE staff watched for any unapproved accounts but none appeared. Chong said
it was a perfect way to end the week.
