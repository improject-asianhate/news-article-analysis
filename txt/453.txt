A home in northeast Louisville, Kentucky, has been vandalized with anti-Asian slurs, ABC 11 reports.
Todd Blankenship opened his door around 11 a.m. on Saturday, April 24, to find the words "GO HOME, Chinese communists," and other racial
slurs spray-painted in yellow across his home.
Blankenship lives in the home with his Thai American wife Sassy and their three children. Sassy has a green card and is currently going through
the process of becoming a citizen, according to WLKY.
Sassy has lived in America for the past four years. In those four years, she says she has never experienced discrimination until now.
"I feel sad because I don't understand. I am Thai, I am an Asian woman. I did not hurt anyone. I did not do anything bad," Sassy told ABC 11.
Blankenship said he didn't think this type of incident happened in their "nice neighborhood." He added that the hardest part of the situation is
explaining it to his daughter. ProQuest document 1 of 1 Full Text | Newspaper Kentucky Home Vandalized With Anti - Asian Slurs Tamanaha , A. ( 2021 , Apr 28 ) .
