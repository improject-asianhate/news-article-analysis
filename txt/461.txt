Joseph Russo, 27, faces multiple charges for hate crimes against Asian Americans.
The first incident occurred on March 5 around 9:20 a.m. local time in the Gravesend neighborhood of Brooklyn. Russo is accused of pushing a 64-year-old Asian American
woman onto the sidewalk, ABC reported.
On March 22, around 7:45 a.m. local time, authorities charge him with attacking an Asian American for the second time. Police say he grabbed a 32-year-old Asian woman
by her hair on Kings Highway in Homecrest.
In a video released by police, Russo can be seen dragging the victim by her hair a few feet before releasing her, according to the New York Post.
In the third and most recent incident, Russo randomly pushed a 77-year-old man while he looked at vegetables for sale in front of the J&R NY Supermarket in Sheepshead
Bay.
Cops have stated Russo is facing charges of assault and harassment as hate crimes in each of the incidents.
