The Others. Them.
The very words sound sinister. No wonder they became the titles of horror movies.
But they're what we focus on, in a time of fear. Prejudice could be the one thing that spreads more easily than COVID-19.
"In an epidemic, a lot of feelings get very primitive," said psychologist and psychoanalyst Spyros D. Orfanos. "People get very fearful and xenophobic. They need to externalize
the blame. They need to find somebody who is at fault for this."
Groups that can be "blamed" for the epidemic — Asians in particular — have been reporting an uptick of bias incidents in the last two months. Groups that have been associated
with a particular outbreak, such as Orthodox Jews, have reported the same.
Even the best of us — as we heroically come together to fight a common enemy — are liable to regard our fellow beings with just a wee bit of suspicion.
We worry about The Other — the neighbor we cross the street to avoid, the person in the store we back away from.
And we worry, especially, about people seen as apart from the community — the ones whose ways are unfamiliar, and whose motives are suspect. Them.
"I think in general people are either consciously or unconsciously biased towards other races," said Orfanos, director of New York University's postdoctoral program in
psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. "And whenever something unexpected or fearful happens, a threat that is unprecedented, it interferes with our thinking."
Unlike the Others of "The Others" (2001) — ghosts — and the Them of "Them!" (1954) — giant ants — our other-ing of others right now has a superficial basis in truth.
There is, in fact, a disease called COVID-19 that some of us are carrying.
It did originate in a particular country — as all diseases do — though that's pretty much academic, since it's now worldwide. And there have been cases of localized outbreaks
connected with some particular groups (and many other outbreaks not connected with them).
But it's telling that the bias incidents tend to be aimed mostly at populations that are already stigmatized. Asians and Jews, in particular.
There's been an incident
Incidents ranging from verbal harassment (67.3%) to physical assault (10%) to being coughed and spat on (2.7%) to being banned from public transportation (1.0%) have
been reported by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, which on April 3 cited over 1,100 reported incidents of anti-Asian bias nationally, clocked over a two-week period.
One such incident was recounted in a Los Angeles Times editorial: "A white man on open sidewalk approached and stepped directly in front of me and coughed in extremely
exaggerated manner in my face — loudly, mouth wide open, about 2 feet from my face, said 'take my virus.'"
There are other such reports. The Asian woman who was punched on West 34th Street by another woman who made anti-Asian slurs (March 10). The man in the New York
subway who sprayed air freshener at an Asian passenger (Feb. 6). The Asian student attacked in London by four men who told him, "We don't want your coronavirus in our
country" (Feb. 24).
Members of the Orthodox Jewish community also started to worry, when an outbreak originating in a New Rochelle synagogue led in March to a "containment area" around the
town.
"We're seeing stuff online," Evan Bernstein, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Northeast Division, told the The Journal News and lohud.com on March 4. "We're
getting more and more reports of those comments."
In Lakewood, tensions have flared between Orthodox Jews — there have been a few cases of weddings held, in violation of rules banning large gatherings — and the rest of the
community. A local petition to shut Lakewood down was condemned by Gov. Phil Murphy.
"Scapegoating, bullying, or vilification of any community is completely unacceptable — today or ever," Murphy tweeted. "There is a special place in hell for the small minority
that do this during this crisis."

A surge in anti-Semitic gibes, cartoons and conspiracy theories online, since the COVID crisis hit, has also been reported on the ADL website.
There seem to be two lines of thought, mutually exclusive: that Jews are more likely to have the disease, and that Jews are masterminds who somehow created it, for their own
sinister reasons. A Wisconsin white supremacist named "Uncle" Paul Nehlen has floated the idea that COVID is a Jewish bioweapon, created in Israel, for the purpose of
controlling China. "You gonna let these jealous, vindictive jews get away with it?" he posted on the messaging platform Telegram in January.
"I feel like I'm living in the middle ages," said American studies professor Michael Aaron Rockland of Rutgers. "It's the mystery of this thing that has people scared."
Coronabias
There are also milder forms of bias. The people, for instance, who avoided Chinese restaurants — back when you could still go to restaurants — for what they would say are
rational reasons. After all, COVID-19 did originate in China, right? And you don't really know where the waiter might be from, right?
Actually there's no more reason to think that a person of Chinese ancestry had just visited Wuhan than a person of Swedish ancestry had just visited Stockholm. Still, business
was down 70% in New York's Chinatown, the trade magazine Restaurant Hospitality reported in March.
But no one reported a comparable downtick in Italian restaurants. Not even in late March, when Italy's death toll surpassed China's, with as many as 250 people dying in a day.
No one worried about whether Mario, at the pizzeria, might have just returned from Naples.
Scapegoats — particularly in an epidemic — can also be useful.
COVID has been branded "Chinese Virus" and even "Kung Flu" by politicians who want to make sure we never forget which ethnic group is to "blame." Gays and Haitians were
stigmatized for AIDS — labeled a "gay disease" even though in some parts of the world, like sub-Saharan Africa, it's largely heterosexual. The English called syphilis "the French
Disease." The Dutch called rickets "the English Disease." The "Spanish Flu" — the last modern pandemic comparable to COVID-19 — didn't originate in Spain. It just happened
that Spain, being neutral during World War I, was the first to report the disease; other countries suppressed the news for propaganda reasons.
In the early 1900s, the career of "Typhoid Mary" Mallon, an Irish cook who infected 51 people in seven families, led to an upswing in anti-Irish prejudice. Irish immigrants were
dirty, unsanitary — what more proof did you need than this one bizarre case? You certainly didn't want them cooking your soup or washing your bed linens.
And, of course, the "Black Death" pandemic of the 14th century led to hate crimes galore — particularly against Jews, who were burned in large numbers.
Who's afraid?
"The dominant thing is fear of the unknown," said Lisa Lyons, a clinical psychologist practicing in Teaneck and New York. "It's all about the terror of what they don't know. So
they blame the outsider: the Asian woman, the Irish cook, the Orthodox Jew."
The plague-bringer — the invader from somewhere else, bringing contagion — is a very old cultural memory.
You can see it vividly enacted in the classic 1922 silent film "Nosferatu" — an early "Dracula" movie that taps into medieval ideas about disease. In the film, a ghost ship sails
into the town harbor at night. A gaunt stranger — the vampire — disembarks, followed by hundreds of plague rats. A few days later, the streets are full of funerals.
"Nosferatu! Was it he who brought the plague to Bremen in 1838?" reads a title card.
The Other might be personified as vampires — a tuberculosis epidemic in 19th-century New England was, in fact, blamed on them. Or it might be any ethnic, social or religious
group that is considered out of the mainstream.
"You can tell people that, and they will even say themselves that this is ridiculous," Rockland said. "But there's a part of them that still believes it. Things don't happen without
some sort of conspiracy."
