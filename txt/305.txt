Nancy Toh was standing outside Westchester Mall in White plains around 7:30 p.m. when a man approached her.
Toh says that the man cocked his head back, spat at her and punched her in the nose, according to The New
York Post.The punch knocked Toh to the ground. She hit her head and fell unconsciouss.
When she came to, Toh told ABC 7 New York a good Samaritan was tending to her. She was covered in blood.
“Bleeding lots from the brain. Looks like pumping out,” Toh said.
Toh’s daughter Linda Toh said the attack has made her more afraid.
“I didn’t think it was so close to home,” Linda Toh told ABC 7 New York. “And now I’m afraid to go out and my
kid is afraid to go out.”
The suspect is an unhoused man who, according to police, has a violent history. White Plains Police say they’re
throwing all their resources behind incidents like this one.
“An incident like this — we throw all our resources at it,” White Plains Police Department Capt. James Spencer
