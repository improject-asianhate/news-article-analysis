A 56-year-old Asian man was pummeled by a stranger during an unprovoked attack on the Lower East Side,
officials said Wednesday.
The Tuesday night beatdown was the latest in a series of random attacks on Asian-Americans across the city.
The victim, Teoh Ming, of Brooklyn, was approaching the East Broadway subway station near Rutgers St. when
his attacker stormed up and punched him about 8:50 p.m., knocking him to the ground.
Ming, a Malaysian immigrant of Chinese descent, said he's lived in the city for more than 20 years, and he still
likes New York City.
"This is something I can't understand. I don't know what happened. I was going down the steps and he was
coming up," he said.
"He hit me three times," he said, pointing to his black left eye and his cut lip.
"And the rest, I don't remember anything after that. I fell down and I don't know what happened next."

know if the violence was a hate crime, he said.
"I'm an Asian man in Chinatown and he attacked me. I don't know why he wanted to punch me. He didn't say
anything," he said.
The suspect was described as Black and in his 30s and was wearing a gray coat. He ran off and had not been
caught.
The NYPD hate crimes unit was investigating the attack, police said.
The assault comes during a wave of anti-Asian violence advocates say is fueled by racism and ignorance about
the COVID-19 pandemic.
More than 200 New Yorkers rallied in Foley Square on Saturday (photo) to denounce the violence, which
included an incident at the square near Manhattan Federal Court last Thursday where a stranger stabbed a 36-
year-old Asian man in the back.
