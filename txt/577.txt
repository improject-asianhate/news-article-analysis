It's a matter of human nature, I suppose, to choose to place blame on someone or something for an agonizing, catastrophic event. We may not always have all the
correct information, and we may not even be accurate as to what was behind it, but I guess that really doesn't matter, as long as someone pays.
All right, so you're angry, join the club! I totally believe 100% of all Americans are angry regarding how the pandemic affected them for one reason or another. You have
been sick, your family and friends have been sick, you were laid off, your business went under, or regrettably someone you loved died. All good reasons to be angry.
So who pays for your pain? Our nation is kind of at that point right now, where many people have picked out someone to vilify for COVID-19. And believe me, there are
many targets to choose from. Of course, there's Donald Trump, who was president when the pandemic began. Then we can add former Vice President Mike Pence, who
was Trump's pandemic point man. I'm quite sure most Americans have had enough of Dr. Fauci, who can't help changing his mind on a daily basis. Of course, President
Biden's mask mandate was frustrating, and his COVID-19 relief package price was so astronomical, it may have actually crippled the restart of America's recovery.
Needless to say, the daily updates and recommendations by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were more confusing than Dr. Fauci's daily diatribe. And if
you're a Minnesotan, Gov. Walz's lockdown, mandates and restart program would have more than tested the patience of Job.
Or maybe we can blame the Chinese. After all, isn't China where the virus came from? But what if we don't know which Asian people we come in contact with are actually
Chinese? After all, don't all Asian people look alike? Shouldn't all of them be punished for this indiscriminate virus?
Regrettably, that's exactly what's happening across the world and in our own backyards. Asian people have become targets of opportunity for many angry people in
America. NBC News reported 3,800 hate incidents between March 19, 2020, and Feb. 28, 2021. That number is up from 2,600 incidents reported in that time period a
year ago.
An Asian American Pacific Islander advocacy organization reported 68% of the assaults happened to women, while 29% of victims were men, and 3% listed themselves
as transgender or nonbinary.
These attacks include being spat upon, verbally abused, pushed, shoved, punched, or thrown to the ground, or refusing to give them service in a store. However, some
people have taken it to a sadistic level. The BBC reports a Chinese woman was slapped in the face before being set on fire. An elderly Thai man was killed when he was
violently thrown to the ground. ProQuest document 1 of 1 Full Text Newspaper Attacks on Asian Americans are abhorrent Attacks on Asian Americans are abhorrent . ( 2021 , Jun 13 ) .

After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, the
government systematically rounded up people of Japanese descent, placing 120,000 of them in confinement camps for nearly four years, fearing they would attack
America from within.
What everyone needs to realize is that every Asian American in our country has also suffered through the ravages of COVID-19 just as we all have. If anyone can actually
attempt to justify these abhorrent attacks, you truly need to look into your soul and figure out who you really are.
