As an Asian American growing up in the United States, I experienced frequent insensitive racial questions: Do you
know kung fu? Why are your eyes like that? Where are you really from?
Now as an adult, I often receive outright racist remarks. For example, recently in my capacity as a practicing
physician treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients, I advocated for continued mask usage until a majority of our
fellow Americans are vaccinated. I received some vicious feedback: Go back to Wuhan. Stop being George Soros’
patsy. Shut up and let the real Americans talk.
None of this of course makes any sense — I was born in the United States and my family is from a region of China
over 600 miles away from Wuhan. This pandemic has led to more racism. I was thus pleasantly surprised and
excited that in their first few weeks, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have strongly denounced
the ongoing violence and hate crimes against Asian Americans and other minority groups.
Hate crimes grew during pandemic
The pair deserve praise for showing national leadership against this discrimination. Biden recently signed an
executive memorandum condemning “racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian American and Pacific
Islander” communities, and Biden and Harris released videos this month on the Lunar New Year to further bring
attention to these issues. This is in the context of increasing violence and hate crimes against Asian-Americans
across the nation during the pandemic.
For example, earlier this year, a 91-year-old Asian man in a California Chinatown was brutally attacked, while
another elderly man was attacked with a box cutter in New York. Stop AAPI Hate, a website that aggregates
reported incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans, reports significant increases in the last 11 months, to
nearly 3,000 separate events.

The hate often is linked to individuals blaming China for creating the coronavirus pandemic, and that animosity
spills into anyone who looks to be of Asian descent, whether they are American citizens or not. National leadership
and rhetoric are vital to combatting this, and the current administration should be applauded for taking this head-
on.
America can help: Biden needs to mobilize the global community to produce the COVID-19 vaccine
In addition to continuing to publicly and specifically identify the increase in hate crimes, Biden has signed four
related executive orders related to tackling the issue. This has brought awareness to a minority group whose
inequities are often overlooked and swept away with the label of the “model minority.”
'A stain on our national character'
Contrast this to the previous administration which actively stoked aggression against Asian groups. Former
President Donald Trump and his staff repeatedly called the coronavirus the “Kung Flu” and the “Chinese virus.” The
World Health Organization has called such geographical labeling discriminatory, and public health experts have said
it perpetuates xenophobia. It also allows people an innocent scapegoat against which to funnel their coronavirus
fears and agitation. Words matter. None more so than those used by the leaders of the free world.
Schiff and Klobuchar: To honor Jamal Khashoggi, punish countries that target journalists: Schiff and Klobuchar
In his Lunar New Year video, Biden called racism, harassment and hate crimes “simply wrong — it’s a stain on our
national character.” We are currently going through a reckoning against racial discrimination, highlighted by the
Black Lives Matter movement. Whether it’s asking young Asian-Americans about their “kung fu” or beating elderly
Asian-Americans over the “kung flu,” we need to continue bringing attention to racism against all minority groups,
so we can recognize and extinguish it. Thank you, President Biden and Vice President Harris, for taking another
step forward to achieve this goal.
