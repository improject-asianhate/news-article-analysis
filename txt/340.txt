HOST: LISA LAFLAMME
LISA LAFLAMME: On both sides of this closed border, COVID-19 has opened the door to an alarming spike in
anti-Asian hate crimes. Newly released video shows one of the latest disturbing assaults. A 67-year-old man
attacked by three people in a San Francisco Laundromat. The racism, though, has been fuelled not just by the
pandemic, but by politics. Here's CTV's Washington bureau chief Joy Malbon.
JOY MALBON (Reporter): At his tea shop in Washington, Yunhan Zhang worries who will come through the door
next. Last November, a man attacked him with pepper spray, yelling "Chinese," "COVID." The assault left him
choking, angry, and sad, blaming an increase of anti-Asian racism in part on the words of Donald Trump.
DONALD TRUMP (Former US President): Some people call it the Chinese flu.
TRUMP: China virus.
TRUMP: Kung flu.
YUNHAN ZHANG (Valley Brooke Tea Owner): When leaders say those things, they lift that very thin layer of
protection. All the bigotry, all the hatred can just be unleashed like that.
UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Asian piece of [Bleep]

MALBON: A surge of attacks caught on video. A grandmother punched and robbed in California. This man
brutally slashed in the face on the New York subway. And a grandfather in his San Francisco neighbourhood
beaten so badly he later died.
MONTHANUS RATANAPAKDEE (Daughter): He never wake up again. I never see him again.
MALBON: Advocacy groups tracked 3,000 hate incidents against Asian-Americans since March to December last
year. And it's happening in Canada, too. Despite a much smaller population, at least 1,000 incidents reported.
AMY GO (Chinese Canadian National Council for Social Justice): We have higher ratio of racist attacks.
MALBON: Amy Go is fourth generation Canadian, but one year into the COVID crisis, even she feels unsafe.
GO: We were blamed to bring SARS to Canada, just like we are blamed for bringing COVID to Canada. We are
definitely seen as foreigners. That's why we are told to go back to China.
MALBON: Now prominent Asian-American stars are speaking out.
DANIEL DAE KIM (Actor): We're so tired of having to say we are American.
MALBON: Former Raptors' player Jeremy Lin wrote about being called coronavirus on the court.
JEREMY LIN (Professional Basketball Player): My teammates heard it. Their teammates heard it. Nobody did
anything.
MALBON: President Joe Biden specifically condemned racism against Asian-Americans in an executive order. And
while it's a start, advocates say these attacks must be treated more seriously. Lisa.
LAFLAMME: So true. All right, Joy Malbon in Washington tonight.
