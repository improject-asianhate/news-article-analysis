Guwahati, April 2 -- The Covid-19 is set to dominate the future debates on globalization, but its impact is not
merely limited to the field of health or international relations. Donald Trump, the President of the United States,
called the Covid-19 as the 'Chinese virus' or 'China virus' on multiple occasions. In his defence, he had pointed out
that the term was not racist at all as the virus was said to have originated in that country. However, he changed his
position and tweeted that the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US was not the fault of the Asian-Americans.
Partly responsible for this change of heart may be the fact that the Asian-Americans have been a target of growing
number of racist and xenophobic attacks related with the virus.
However, closer home, disturbing facts related to an 'old virus' but having mutated to a new form are doing the
rounds in many parts of India now. This pertains to a spike in racist taunts/attacks against the northeasterners with
reference to the novel coronavirus. One would like to call it Racism-19 for the sake of brevity.
There are instances galore of this latest trend which is raising its ugly head. The most infamous being how a
Manipuri girl was spat on and called 'corona' while she stepped out to pick up essentials in North Delhi. Fortunately
in this case, the police acted promptly and arrested the culprit.
In Kolkata, 'Go corona go' chants could be heard in a particular locality. No, this wasn't any community confidence
building exercise to tide over the dark clouds hanging over all of us due to the pandemic, but a mob that had
gathered outside the flat where three women from Nagaland resided. The crowd was adamant that the women ' so-
called 'carriers of the virus' ' should immediately leave their house as well as the locality. When the incidents like
these occur, it is difficult to understand whether the crowd was driven by genuine fear of Covid-19 or outright
racism. As the videos doing the rounds on social media show, the crowd was not maintaining any social distancing,
and hence the possibility of the former appears low.

In another harrowing tale, the members of a housing society in Ahmedabad harassed some students from the
Northeast and pressurized them to vacate the house and move out. Fortunately, the cops intervened but imagine
the mental agony of having to live with such neighbours who would do anything to push you out. What is difficult to
understand is that the students neither had any foreign travel history nor had shown any symptoms of the virus.
Another video which is going viral on the micro blogging site Twitter is of some people from Nagaland not being
allowed to buy groceries from a departmental store in Karnataka amidst the lockdown. The youth can be heard
pleading that they are Indians, that they have Aadhar Cards and that they need groceries just like everybody else
to survive. Hopefully, some agency of the State apparatus would intervene again to stop this madness.
The four instances prove that the problem is not confined to a particular part of the country but is all pervasive. In
fact so widespread has been the problem that a New Delhi-based rights group, namely, Rights and Risk Analysis
Group (RRAG), has recently released a report titled 'Coronavirus Pandemic: India's Mongoloid Looking People Face
Upsurge of Racism'. They have cited at least 22 cases of racial discrimination or hate crimes against such people
between February 7 and March 25, 2020. What is more worrying apart from the geographical spread is the fact that
such acts have taken place in upscale restaurants and campuses of prestigious educational institutions.
As a northeasterner who has spent many years outside the region, this writer has been lucky to have been largely
insulated from such racial slurs. However, whenever there is a discussion on racism against the northeasterners,
the most common rebuttal is that many 'outsiders' are not treated fairly in the Northeast. Though this is a more
complicated story driven by factors such as partition history, landlocked geography, issues of demography and the
larger threats emanating from illegal migration, it would not be unwise to revisit this criticism and take stock of
what better could be done.
Amidst all the gloom, one positive development is that all these issues are getting a lot of coverage in the national
media/web media. On many occasions in the past, many northeasterners feel that the mainstream media has been
found wanting on important issues of the Northeast but not so this time. The Government has also taken a serious
note of the issue and on March 21 last, the Ministry of Home Affairs has issued an advisory to all the States/UTs to
take action against such racial attacks.
It is often said that crisis is the true test of character. The pandemic has caused large-scale panic and fear and the
governments across the world are doing all they can to keep the citizens safe. However, as citizens we would also
have to give a test of our character and resolve, and the best way to start is by calling out unjust and racist
behaviour.
