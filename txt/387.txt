I was sitting at my desk when a student in front of me put up their hands and shot me.
The barrel of the gun was made up of the boy's two fleshy fingers and his thumb was the hammer that clicked down again and again as he spoke what passed for his language of gunfire loud enough to make the teacher glare at him.
It was make-believe. But this week, that memory felt a lot more real.
I was in the fifth grade during a history class learning about World War II, specifically about Pearl Harbor and the bombing of Nagasaki and Hiroshima. I'd learn something else that day, too. Even though I lived in America, I spoke English and I was very much a part of this country, my peers wouldn't see past the fact that I was Japanese.
My birth was half a century removed from the war, but a piece of me feels like
I inherited some kind of responsibility. I feel sorry for the lives lost from the Pearl Harbor attack, and at the same time I feel sorry for my ancestors that had been ravaged by the atomic bombs and their effects.
I've come a long way and learned a lot from that day in elementary school.
Now, I'm 22 years old, and I'm writing about the nightmares you'd find in a history book. A gunman in Atlanta went on a killing spree that killed six Asians and two other people.
I woke up Wednesday to text messages from my colleagues and friends asking how I was doing. Next thing I saw on my phone was a headline about a shooter that killed eight people. I didn't make the connection at that moment.
I picked up my cat and said, "Happy Birthday Soba!" She purred into my chest, a creature comfort I had no idea I would need for rest of the day.
It happened in less than an hour.
Tensions across the country were high and I was driving home to make sure my mom was going to be okay. She is independent but I knew some moral support could help her.
I texted my mom, "Be careful." When I didn't get a text back I thought it would be best to play it safe and go home in case she needed me to be there for her.
Before I knew it, I had two stories on my hands and my foot on the gas pedal, heading from Staunton, Virginia, back to Ohio to be with my family after the attack.
It was stressful six-hour drive, full of phone calls, coordination and chaos.
It was a new experience to report on something that I could relate to intimately. I had no time to process my own feelings during the drive but was able to connect with the Asian community at my new home in Staunton in a way I never imagined I would.
We reflected on discrimination, family and fear.
We all had this fear of something happening not just to us, but our parents. We didn't want to let our moms out the door alone. All of a sudden, the biggest threat in my life wasn't COVID; now it was my own identity.
I began to question my own security when I got a text message from someone I know who gave me their address in case my safety was compromised where I lived because I was Asian.
Normal life had made me accustomed to the vulnerability of being a woman but this week's attack added an extra layer of anxiety onto my identity.
Journalism is no easy feat, especially doing it over the phone while driving down the road at 70 mph.
The highway was dark and the rain was pouring when I pulled up to my parent's house. My mom opening the front door felt like a relief, but I know there are family members across the country that people can never come home to.
Writing and reflecting on this week's act of hate was challenging, but it left me with something I didn't have before.
I had met other Asians in Staunton who mourned with me, shared their fears with me and looked toward a better and more loving future with me. I talked with my friend Anhthu who I've gotten to know recently and I felt that the conversation I had with her on the way to Ohio made us feel closer.
This period of our shared American history is going to mean different things for many different people.
It's a time for contemplation, time for anger or even forgiveness.
I know whatever I felt today is only a fraction of the destruction of the lives of the victims' families.
Asians in this country have been targeted before in horrific hate crimes and now my mom and I are afraid it won't be the last.
What will it take for this to be the time for change?
