Celebrities are speaking out about the latest tragedy in the Asian community.
Seven women and one man, most of them of Asian descent, were killed Tuesday night in three Atlanta-area spa
shootings. Two shootings were in northeast Atlanta and the third in Cherokee County. Police arrested 21-year-old Robert
Aaron Long as the suspected gunman. Police said Long told authorities his actions were motivated by a sex addiction,
not race, and he may have frequented some of the spas where the shootings happened.
While police said Long told authorities his actions were motivated by sex addiction, many experts and top Asian
American lawmakers say it's hard not to see racism inextricably tied to the killings due to a recent wave of attacks
against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.
Trevor Noah agrees. The "Daily Show" host slammed claims that the shootings weren't racially-charged on his
Wednesday segment.
"Your murders speak louder than your words," Noah said.
"Don't tell me that this thing had nothing to do with race, even if the shooter said that. He thinks it had to do with his
sex addiction." he added. "This guy blamed a specific race of people for his problems and then murdered them because
of it. If that's not racism then the word has no meaning."
Trevor also criticized Cherokee County sheriff spokesperson Capt. Jay Baker who said the shooter had a "bad day" in a
press conference Wednesday.
"No, yesterday was a 'bad day' for the people who lost their lives. It's always interesting who police try and find the
humanity in," Noah said.

What to know about Atlanta shootings: Suspect charged with murder; killings inextricably tied to race, experts say
Olivia Munn, more stars call to #StopAsianHate
Olivia Munn, who recently called out new Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Alexi McCammond for her past racist tweets against
Asians, said she's "struggling" with the latest act of violence.
"We are being targeted, we are living in a country that is attacking us simply just for being us," Munn said Wednesday
during an interview with Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC's "Deadline: White House."
Munn said the Asian-American community needs "more people to care about us" and "amplify" opposition to such
attacks. She added, "We need people on social media to denounce this kind of stuff that is happening against us. It’s so
important that we are heard because we have been so invisible for so long."
She also shared the #StopAsianHate hashtag on Twitter.
Actor Daniel Dae Kim said: "The race of the person committing the crime matters less than the simple fact that if you
act with hate in your heart, you are part of the problem. And to those with the power to help and yet sit idly by, your
silence is complicity. #StopAsianHate."
A rise in anti-Asian attacks: Here's how to be an ally to the community
Lana Condor calls for Asian community allies
Some took to social media to spread awareness about the event, with "To All the Boys I Loved Before" actress Lana
Condor urging her followers to "wake up" and encouraging people to be allies to the Asian community.
"Your Asian friends and family are deeply scared, horrified, sick to their stomachs and wildly angry. Please please please
check in on us, please please please stand with us. Please. Your Asian friend needs you, even if they aren't publicly
grieving on social media."
Comedian Mindy Kaling urged people to fight against the normalization of anti-Asian rhetoric.
"The targeting of our Asian brothers and sisters is sickening, but not surprising given the normalizing of anti-Asian hate
speech in the past year. We have to #StopAsianHate, enough is enough!"
"Asians are not a monolith," Padma Lakshmi tweeted, adding that "the continent includes around 48 countries and 3
territories, all with unique cultures, food customs and traditions." But she declared, "A racist attack against one of us is
an attack against all of us."
George Takei, Jamie Chung call on leadership for changes
George Takei called the shooting "a hate crime."
Takei also urged GOP leaders to "stop fanning violence with anti-Asian rhetoric." On March 9, House of Representatives
minority leader Kevin McCarthy shared online COVID-19 resources, but used the term "Chinese coronavirus."
"Words have consequences, especially those from our leaders," Takei continued. "Reporters: Ask politicians who trade in
racism if they feel responsible or remorseful for violence committed in the wake of their words."
Speaking up: Jeannie Mai 'filled with so much anger' over rise of attacks on Asian Americans
Actress Jamie Chung said "using (Asian Americans) as a scapegoat for a global pandemic" needs to "end now.
"These murders and countless acts of violence and the destruction of businesses and white terrorism in our communities
are the direct cause of politicians and leaders fanning the flames of anti Asian rhetoric," she wrote on Instagram.
"Historically Asian immigrants have been the scapegoat for others misfortunes."

She continued: "It starts by calling it what it is. MEDIA YOU NEED TO DO BETTER, CALL IT WHAT IT IS, DOMESTIC
TERRORISM HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIANS."
"Crazy Rich Asians" star Gemma Chan asked her Instagram followers to "please pay attention to what is happening,
adding "don’t be silent."
"We need to stop the (dehumanization) of Asians. We need to stop the scapegoating of Asians for Covid. We need to
unite against all forms of hate," she wrote. "Please spread awareness, check in on your Asian friends because we are
not ok."
"Shang Chi" star Simu Liu described "feeling overwhelming grief at the senseless murder of 8 people in Atlanta.
"Still much we don't know, but it's clear to me that the shooter specifically targeted Asian women. Praying for the
victims' families, and for my Asian sisters. Action to follow," he said.
This is America: Stop gaslighting me with the Asian 'model minority' myth
Kahmora Hall, a Season 13 contestant on "RuPaul's Drag Race" wrote, "Every day I worry about if it were my parents,
sisters, cousins & friends in that heartbreaking situation. My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their
families. #STOPAsianHate."
Celebrities 'stand in solidarity' with the Asian community
Pharrell Williams tweeted a post writing, "Enough is enough. Last night was another instance of innocent lives being
lost to domestic terrorism. We must protect our Asian brothers and sisters."
Singer Rihanna posted a tweet calling the Atlanta shooting "brutal, tragic" and "disgusting." "AAPI hate has been
rampantly perpetuated & it’s disgusting! I’m heartbroken for the Asian community & my heart is with the loved ones
of those we lost," she wrote.
"There is no place for racism, violence, prejudice, or misogyny of any kind, towards any one," Jimmy Fallon tweeted.
Camilla Cabello, who had been accused in 2019 of using racial remarks and has since apologized, tweeted: "We need
to do everything in our power to stand up against hate. Listen to the AAPI community, take their direction, share
resources if you can."
Kim Kardashian West said "Asians are human and deserve to be treated as such."
Her mother, Kris Jenner, added: "I stand in solidarity with the Asian community, and with any individuals who feel
attacked or marginalized because of the color of their skin. We are one world, one humanity, and one community."
John Legend said he is "sending love to all the loved ones of those whose lives were taken.
"Absolutely horrible," the "All of Me" singer wrote in response to Tuesday night's shooting. "Our nation needs to
reckon with the increased threats being directed at our Asian-American brothers and sisters."
"This escalation of attacks on Asian Americans is horrifying. STOP IT. Stop this sickness America. Stop this brutality,"
Patricia Arquette tweeted.
Alyssa Milano showed her support by writing that she stands with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community,
and singer Sara Bareilles described hate toward Asian Americans as "loud," "exhausting" and "destructive."
"The Asian hate crime tonight in Atlanta-Buckhead and Cherokee County is just so (expletive) appalling and so sad,"
Florence Pugh wrote on her Instagram story.
"Everytime (sic) there's a mass shooting it's so heartbreaking and so destructive and yet America just shakes it's (sic)
head as if that's just part of being in America and carries on. It doesn't have to be. This was targeted. This is white
supremacy. This was targeted Asian murder."
