Task: Analyze the given text (enclosed between ### markers) to identify named entities, categorize them, extract relevant sentences, and infer emotions or reactions with a focus on Asian-hate incidents. You only need to output the result of step 4.

Step 1: Named Entity Recognition and Categorization
Identify all named entities in the text and categorize them as follows:

1. Suspects and criminals
2. Victims 
3. Other individuals (mention their role or identity if known)
4. Organizations

Example:

```
Named entities categorized:

Suspects and criminals:
- Unidentified suspect (break-in perpetrator)

Victims:
- Mona SooHoo Wong (Newton resident)
- Scott Chin (Newton resident, break-in victim)

Other individuals:
- John F. Carmichael Jr. (Newton Police Chief)
- Marian Ryan (Middlesex District Attorney)
- Ruthanne Fuller (Mayor of Newton)
- Greer Tan Swiston (Chairwoman of Greater Boston Chinese Cultural Association)
- Anping Shen (Founding president of Chinese American Association of Newton)

Organizations:
- Newton Police Department
- Middlesex District Attorney's Office
- Greater Boston Chinese Cultural Association
- Chinese American Association of Newton
```

Step 2: Extract Related Sentences
For each named entity identified in Step 1, extract all relevant sentences from the text.

Example:

```
Unidentified suspect (break-in perpetrator)
- In the photos, the person wore a black hat and light-colored mask.
- The suspect stole jewelry that was passed down to Chin and his wife from their families.

Mona SooHoo Wong (Newton resident)
- "It makes me feel unsafe. In the 40-plus years I've lived in Newton, I've never felt so targeted," said Mona SooHoo Wong.
- Wong said the recent string of break-ins have her worried and left feeling on edge.

Scott Chin (Newton resident, break-in victim)
- "At this point, I think it's safe to say it's definitely targeting Asians," Chin said. "Things are going a little bit slow in getting the word out."
- Chin, who was raised in Newton, said his home's surveillance system recorded images of the suspect, who broke in by smashing open a glass patio door while the house was empty.

Newton Police Department
- Local leaders, including Newton Police Chief John F. Carmichael Jr. and Middlesex District Attorney Marian Ryan, will attend a community meeting Thursday at 8 p.m. to address residents' concerns.
- Investigators are also asking for the public's help to identify a person photographed in video surveillance at the time of the break-ins on Dedham Street and Helene Road.
```

Step 3: Infer Emotions or Reactions
Using the extracted sentences, infer the emotions or reactions toward Asian-hate for each named entity. Provide the entity type, emotion or reaction, and a reason for each inference. If an entity's emotion cannot be inferred, state "Cannot be inferred."

Example:

```
- Unidentified suspect (break-in perpetrator) / Suspects and criminals / Cannot be inferred / 
- Mona SooHoo Wong (Newton resident) / Victims / Fear + Anxiety / She expresses feeling unsafe and targeted, and has changed her behavior by keeping windows shut, indicating a state of fear and anxiety due to the potential Asian-hate motivated crimes.
- Scott Chin (Newton resident, break-in victim) / Victims / Anger + Frustration / He firmly believes the crimes are targeting Asians and expresses frustration at the slow pace of information dissemination, suggesting anger at the situation and frustration with the authorities' response.
- John F. Carmichael Jr. (Newton Police Chief) / Other individuals / Caution / His statement shows a careful approach to not immediately label the crimes as hate-motivated, indicating a cautious stance in the investigation.
- Newton Police Department / Organizations / Investigative / The department's actions show an investigative approach, seeking public help and analyzing evidence to solve the crimes.
```

Step 4: Generate /-delimited format

Using the output in step 3, convert it into a /-delimited format.

Example:

"""

```
Entity/Entity Type/Emotion/Reason
Unidentified suspect (break-in perpetrator)/Suspects and criminals/Cannot be inferred/ 
Mona SooHoo Wong (Newton resident)/Victims/Fear + Anxiety/She expresses feeling unsafe and targeted, and has changed her behavior by keeping windows shut, indicating a state of fear and anxiety due to the potential Asian-hate motivated crimes.
Scott Chin (Newton resident, break-in victim)/Victims/Anger + Frustration/He firmly believes the crimes are targeting Asians and expresses frustration at the slow pace of information dissemination, suggesting anger at the situation and frustration with the authorities' response.
John F. Carmichael Jr. (Newton Police Chief)/Other individuals/Caution/His statement shows a careful approach to not immediately label the crimes as hate-motivated, indicating a cautious stance in the investigation.
Newton Police Department/Organizations/Investigative/The department's actions show an investigative approach, seeking public help and analyzing evidence to solve the crimes.
