The new coronavirus is spreading fast around the world and so is racism against Asian people.
TV personality and Korean-American lawyer Suh Dong-joo, 36, lashed out at the increasing number of racially motivated attacks against Koreans and other Asians in the United States amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
'Do you want us to wear a mask or not wear a mask? I'm getting mixed messages here,' Suh, who lives in San Francisco, wrote on Instagram. 'If Asians get beat up for both wearing a mask and not, what do you expect us to do?'
The comment comes five days after she posted the photo of herself wearing a face mask, saying she was concerned about growing racism. Asians see increase in racially motivated attacks against them

On Feb. 24, Jonathan Mok, a 23-year-old Singaporean, was attacked while walking down the streets in London by a group of four men who said: 'we don't want your coronavirus in our country.' The attack resulted in a broken bone near his eye.
On Mar. 6, another disturbing video was widely circulated on social media, in which a black man sprayed Febreeze air freshener at an Asian guy after having an argument on a New York City train.
