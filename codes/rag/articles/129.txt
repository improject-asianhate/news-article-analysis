Bronze-coloured plaques with the message "Wuhan plague" popped up on buildings across Atlanta.
An Asian-American student on his way to a boba tea shop was told, "Thanks for COVID."
In suburban Atlanta, an Asian-American couple returning from the movies found a slur spray painted on their car.
For months, Asian-Americans in Georgia, like in many areas across the country, have faced escalating verbal abuse and harassment, local advocates said.
The already on-guard community reacted with shock and fear Tuesday as it mourned the deaths of six Asian-American women and two others fatally shot at Atlantaarea spas.
The violence toward the businesses "is frightening and alarming," Chris Chan, an advisory chair for the Asian-American Action Fund Georgia Chapter, told The Washington Post.
Chan said Asian-Americans in Georgia had recently faced "words yelled at us or threatening gestures and actions" but "nothing rising to what we are seeing tonight."
Police, who arrested Robert Aaron Long, 21, in connection with the shootings, said they had yet to know a motive.
But as the shooting came amid a national surge of racist attacks and threats against Asian-Americans, advocates Tuesday reacted with alarm and police from Seattle to New York ramped up security in Asian American neighbourhoods.
