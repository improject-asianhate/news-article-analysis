Asian healthcare workers in the COVID-19 pandemic: a long road to recovery

Almost one and a half years ago,
the first case of COVID-19 was
confirmed in Wuhan, China,
followed by a state of global health
emergency due to a worldwide pandemic.
Effective vaccines against COVID-19 were
finally released, and over 40% of the US
population has now been fully vaccinated.
The battle of the United States versus
COVID-19 seems to have reached the
mitigation phase. However, for many living
in this country, the detrimental effects of
this virus may still be ongoing.
Long before the pandemic, the Asian
population in the United States had
been viewed and treated as the physical
embodiment of foreignness and disease, and
this stigma does not disappear because you
are a medical worker wearing a white coat.
As the stress levels of society elevated with
the outbreak of a China-originated virus, the
increase in negative bias against the Asian
population was perhaps not surprising.
When I first moved to the United States
to advance my career, it was right at the peak
of the pandemic. News of racist assaults
and ignorant attacks against Asians were
broadcast, and I can recall some headlines
saying ‘the assaults are spreading faster than
the coronavirus’. Although I live in one of
the most Asian-friendly states, in California,
it was not easy to reassure myself and others
about my personal safety.
While many can practice social isolation
by working from home, most healthcare
workers are still meeting people of all
ethnic backgrounds and personal values.
Born and raised in a country with limited
understanding about racial discrimination,
I was prepared for possible hostility from
people of different skin colors. “To some,

everyone with yellow skin either has COVID-
19, or should be partially responsible for the

impact of COVID-19 in this country,” said
one of my Asian American friends. Were
Asian healthcare workers treated aggressively
by racist patients? Yes. Were they teased
disrespectfully on subjects about COVID-19?

Of course. However, because of our jobs as
healthcare workers, we are used to ignoring
such comments and suppressing our feelings
when we encounter discrimination.
I later realized that racism does not
come only from patients. Occasionally,
discrimination against Asians, including
microaggressions, can be observed within the
medical community. These microaggressions
may be an anonymous comment in an
online physician forum, a careless statement
recorded in an academic interview, an
ignorant joke told by some hospital workers
passing by, or even an unconscious act of a
colleague. Physical attacks are not common
in our work environments, but emotional and
verbal aggressions can be seen in all forms
and from all sources. Are these comments
repeated when people leave work and interact
with others in non-medical professions? We
cannot know. Nevertheless, with the public
influence of healthcare workers, due to their
professional roles, even the least intended
discriminative language may worsen the
overall effect on society. Sometimes I would
tell myself, “You may need to fight not
only the coronavirus, but also the racism
in your working environment.” In the time
of COVID-19, this fear of Asian healthcare
workers can be easily learned.
It is undeniable that Asian healthcare
workers have suffered from an aggravated
negative bias because of the COVID-19
pandemic. However, I have also learned
to appreciate the opposite side of this; the
pursuit of diversity and equality is also a
shared goal for many in this country. Owing
to my cultural background, in the past I
was unaware that not being discriminated
against on the basis of your skin color is
essential for good mental health. Now I am
grateful that I work in a department that has
long focused on diversity and equality issues.
I have also witnessed many non-Asian
medical workers using their voices to help
eliminate anti-Asian sentiments. Seeing the
efforts of colleagues and strangers, I feel
encouraged to speak up for other Asian

healthcare workers who may or may not
be lucky enough to feel safe, secure and
respected during the COVID-19 pandemic.
With the rapid distribution of vaccines
in the United States, it is estimated that
normality may resume imminently. Beyond
the control of COVID-19, it is unclear what
other aspects of normality should be expected.
The balance between public health and
infection? The resumption of social activities?
Or the recovery of a thriving economy?
In addition to the number of infections
and hospitalizations, the complications of
aggravated racism in certain populations
must be considered. Recovery from the social
and psychological aspects of the COVID-19
pandemic will take longer than recovery from
the disease. This will require medical workers
to attend to the racism-related experiences
and mental health needs of not only their
patients but also their co-workers.
COVID-19 swept through and shook
the United States on multiple levels.
The pandemic revealed not only the
weakness of the human immune system
and the US healthcare system but also
the underestimated extent of racial
discrimination in society and within the
medical community. COVID-19 has taught a
lesson that we are grateful for, but also fearful
of. For many Asian healthcare workers, the
negative experience we have gone through
may not be cured or healed easily. The road
to recovery is long, and for everyone working
in the medical field, this is one important
goal we should fight together for.
