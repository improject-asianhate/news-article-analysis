Locals wrestle with anti-Asian racism: Greenville resident: 'My very existence is a wake-up call'

The xenophobia, or intense fear of outsiders, against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the country reached a fever pitch last month after a slew of hate crimes were reported against Asian Americans across the country, a rise that is linked to the coronavirus pandemic. 
Some in the Upstate hope their stories ones of community and perseverance and hope - will help end the cycle of hate and 
violence. 
And to hear Greenville resident Hao Wu's story is to hear the American Dream. 
Wu was born in China to pro-democracy parents. After his father was blacklisted by the Chinese government for his views, the family spent seven years in hiding from the Communist regime. 
In 1996, they were able to escape to America, where Wu's father secured a job at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee, where Wu grew up. 
He went to school at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and got a job doing biochemical research right out of school. Then, like 9 million other Americans, Wu lost his job during the Great Recession of 2008 and 2009. 
But Wu still wasn't an American. After 13 years in this country, he was still labeled an immigrant. So, he joined the military. 
Wu spent four years as an active-duty combat medic in the U.S. Army. He was deployed overseas twice, once to Iraq, then to Afghanistan. He gained citizenship in 2014 and was honorably discharged from the Army in 2014, he said. 
Wu now calls Greenville home, where he is an "angel investor" for several businesses, meaning he funds enterprises, but does not have a say in day-to-day operations. 
"The American Dream has slowly evolved over the hundreds of years that America has existed, you know, I could be that example. My very existence is a wake-up call," Wu, 36, said. 
As an activist for the Asian American community in the Upstate, Wu hopes his story will break down the barriers of racism and xenophobia that have plagued the Asian and Asian-American communities for hundreds of years. 
But those barriers have become stronger during the past 15 months with the rise of anti-Asian rhetoric and violence during the coronavirus pandemic, when hate crimes are increasing at an alarming rate, according to nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate. 
Asians have been brutally attacked in San Francisco, New York, and in the Atlanta Spa Shootings, which left eight dead, six of which were Asian Americans. Georgia law enforcement officials say the murderer was not motivated by racism, but many, including Wu, dispute that claim. 
"I believe (the suspect) to be a racist, but also misogynist," Wu said in a YouTube video posted to nonprofit Votes for Vets' YouTube 
page. 
Community and exclusion 
The Korea Center of Greenville is housed in a log cabin in Greer, a short drive from Michelin and Top Golf on Pelham Road. Sara Yoon started the center in 2015 after noticing a need for Korean Americans to gather and learn in Greenville. 
The center holds Korean-language classes for children and adults, hosts cultural events and barbecue competitions, and serves as a "starting point" for new Korean immigrants when they arrive in the area. 
Yoon said simple tasks like writing a check, or understanding the cultural difference between Americans and Koreans can be overwhelming and confusing. She's there to help them wade through those turbulent waters. 
Yoon came to America as a young adult, spending a lot of her life in New York and Florida before moving to Greenville with her husband... Greenville is where she built a real estate business, created the Korea Center nonprofit, and raised her daughter. This is 
her home. 
But the past year has shown not everyone feels that way. The pandemic has led to a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and violence. 
"It just sad. And I am feeling betrayed because this is our country. If someone asked me to go home, I have no place to go home," she said. "So it is kind of a sad feeling of betrayal for me as a Korean American who has lived here a lot longer than I have in Korea." 
And it's not just racism and violence the community is facing, it's unemployment. 
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are also facing undue financial hardship more than other demographics, according to USA Today. Almost half of America's unemployed Asians face long-term joblessness (six months or more), according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The figures are worse than those for white, Black, and Hispanic workers, the report found. 
Did COVID lead to a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric? 
The violence and racism Asian Americans are facing is not a new phenomenon. Since they began immigrating to this country in the 19th Century, Asians have been the targets of racist attacks and government action. 
In 1871, a mob murdered 19 Chinese people in Los Angeles, according to Harvard University. The Chinese Exclusion Act - the first piece of U.S. Legislation to restrict immigration based on nationality - was passed four years later and barred Chinese laborers from entering the nation. 
Anti-Asian sentiment flared during World War II and the Vietnam War, leading to a rise in hate crimes and government-sanctioned atrocities, including the imprisonment of thousands of Japanese Americans in internment camps during the 1940s. 
More than a quarter of all Asian Americans have experienced a hate crime during their lives, with 10% of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders saying they were the victim of a racist attack in 2021, according to Stop AAPI Hate, a nonprofit aimed at curbing hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. 
No hate crimes against that demographic have been reported to the State Law Enforcement Division, according to spokesperson Tommy Crosby. But microaggressions - small or subconscious instances of prejudice and racism and verbal attacks are common, according to Wu.

It comes down to this, Clemson senior Kenneth Sloane said: It's not so much, "we're better than you... it's more like, 'why are you here?"" 
Sloane said the pandemic - which originated in China - has allowed people to "attach certain catchphrases or terms" to the rhetoric of anti-Asian racism. 
"People don't say it out loud as much, but I think this pandemic has really given people ways to speak on that or act on that kind of bias that they maybe didn't have in the past," Sloane, who is white and Japanese, said. 
Rise in violence leads to Upstate activism 
A 15-year-old white teenager from Oconee County is among the dozen or so people banding together to stop the xenophobia in Upstate South Carolina. 
Hayden Laye, a high school student from Walhalla, created Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC with about a dozen other activists to promote awareness to the rise in racism and work to end the anti-Asian rhetoric in local communities. 
"We don't have a lot of Asian people in Oconee County or in the Upstate, but it's just that, even if you don't see it, we know what's going on," Laye said. Oconee County's population is less than 1% Asian and the state has an Asian American population of 1.8%, according to the U.S. Census. 
"And we need to help people where it is happening, or even if it's just happening online or to those few people in Oconee County," Laye added. 
Stop Asian Hate Upstate SC is planning to hold rallies across the Upstate in the coming weeks, Laye said. One is tentatively planned for downtown Greenville on April 24. 
The group is a mix of Democrats, Black Lives Matter and Dreamer activists, Laye said. Wu, the Chinese veteran, is also tied to the 
group. 
"It's people from all across the Upstate coming together and across the country to work to end racism." 
Although the group is run by many non-Asians, Wu said he hopes that by putting his story out there, it spurs dialogues and helps other Asian Americans speak out. 
"In the past, we as Asian Americans were more likely to just lower our heads and then try to do our hard work to prove ourselves. But right now, I do believe that we need to do both, we need to continue to do hard work and also put our stories out there."
