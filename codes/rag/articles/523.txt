It's spring and it's cherry blossom time in the nation's capital. A time when America glories in the beauty of the 3,000 cherry trees gifted to us in 1912 by the mayor of Tokyo to celebrate friendship between America and the Japanese people. Last week was also the one-month anniversary of the killing of six Asian women in Atlanta and a vigil was held on the Florida State University Campus. NBC reports there have been 3,800 reported attacks this year on people of Asian descent, up nearly 1,000 from the year before. On Thursday, the U.S. Senate passed an Anti-Asian Hate bill in a 94-1 vote, after hearing testimony from Asian-Americans, including Senator Amy Duckworth, about their own experiences of discriminatory behaviors. The bi-partisan legislation now heads to the Democratic-led House. The recent violence has left Tallahassee Asia Americans unsettled but hopeful. We talked to four about their experiences. 
Artist Yoshiko Murdick worries 
Yoshiko Murdick is a sought-after Tallahassee watercolor painter. She is now 70 years old and has lived in the United States since her 20s when, as an exchange student, she fell in love with her English professor. "Convenient subject," she deadpans with gentle humor. 
Murdick is self-deprecating at times, funny, and like many ethnically diverse people who know they are easily identifiable by their physical features and sometimes behaviors, she finds herself with a constant, low-grade anxiety. 
"I know I act 'funny'," she says, describing her tendency to still make an honorary bow in greeting or gratitude. "Old habit." But what Murdick says she didn't know was the "hatred that exists here." 
Lately, when she walks her cuddly dog, she says she doesn't make eye contact with other walkers any longer. "I try to avoid looking at other people... maybe they are looking at me." 
She, in fact, has been worried enough to buy a stun gun. "A friend of mine in New Jersey was also worried. She quit her job in Manhattan. She did not want to ride the subways or go into the city where the old woman was beaten and nobody helped." 
Murdick says that she is concerned about those she loves. "As a first-generation American, we hear, "Go home!" But the second-generation people can only answer, "Where?" Home is here." 
Although she believes the politics of the previous four years and identifying the COVID virus as a product of Asia set the stage, Murdick also feels it exposed a lot of attitudes she never had suspected. 
Aurora Hansen plans mini Asia fest 
Aurora Hansen, of Filipino descent, is a woman whose influence and involvement in the Tallahassee community stretches far and wide. Artistic Director of Tallahassee Community College's Dance Company; Community Liaison for the Asian Student Union at FSU, Past Chair of the Asian Coalition of Tallahassee, are among her many contributions to the city. 
Currently, she is involved in planning for an Experience Asia Mini Festival, the precursor to the annual large Experience Asia festival held in the fall. "The Mini Festival, set for May 22, in a downtown park, is much like the big one, with Asian music, performers, and food," she says. "Details will be released soon." 
And how does Hansen feel about the current racial climate in the country? Does she wonder if now is a good time to put on an Asian festival? 
"Yes, there are quiet anxieties," she says. "Even here in Tallahassee, I, myself have experienced a 'situation.'" Hansen says that recently, in Midtown, she was accosted by someone who pushed her and said, "Get out of my America." 
Hansen was not cowed, she says, and stood up for herself. But she notes there is often more subtle discrimination, beyond bullying and name-calling. 
She notes that Asian associations around the country have been meeting to offer one another support and reminders of safe behaviors such as "having a buddy go with you into parking garages, and being aware of places you may be vulnerable." 
Portia Campos is 'horrified and angry' 
Hansen is working with Portia Campos, an Assistant Teaching Professor as FSU. Her husband is President of the Big Bend Filipino Association of Tallahassee and she is equally involved in advocacy groups which offer up insights and the ability to experience Asian culture. 
"I am horrified and angry at the targeting," she says, noting that she worries about elderly parents in Jacksonville and an autistic brother. "I stay home more now and don't go certain places alone." 
But Campos is nevertheless feeling excited about the planned Asian festivals. "I believe the local authorities are aware, and though I am a little nervous, we have been putting on these festivals for 18 or 19 years, and I feel good about the Tallahassee community." 
FSU student Tanvi Marulendra calls for empathy 
Tanvi Marulendra, who is of Indian descent, will graduate this year from FSU. She is the Director of the Asian American Student Union. 
While she notes there has been no violence on campus, she says racial slurs, and insensitive comments have always been present, and not just this year. 
"It is our families that we worry about at the moment," she says. "So many Asian people work in the nail salon and hair industry, and the Atlanta violence felt much closer." 
Marulendra says the Asian American Student Union has met with the administration advocating for greater diversity in teaching faculty and staff, and for cultural sensitivity training. "They have been pretty attentive in the past few weeks," she says. 
The group held a campus vigil on the evening of April 16 in memoriam for the six lives lost in Atlanta. Most of all, Marulendra asks of Tallahasseeans is that they remember that each of us is part of a family group, with people we love and worry about, and that that doesn't change, no matter our ethnicity.
"What I hope for and urge is simply for people to lean into their empathy," she says to look beyond superficial differences, to look out for one another. 
And then inhale the aroma of cherry blossoms.
