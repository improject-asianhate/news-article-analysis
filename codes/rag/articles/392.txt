Police are searching for a woman who yelled anti-Asian slurs at a teenage girl after attacking her outside a store in Brooklyn, CBS New York reports. 
The attack occurred near Brighton Beach Avenue near Ocean Parkway around 10 a.m. on Friday, PIX 11 reports. The suspect struck a 17-year-old girl with a cardboard box and yelled anti-Asian slurs.
