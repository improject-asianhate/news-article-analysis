Albert Harris-Russell was pumping gas at a station across from the Orange County Jail when a stranger confronted him and yelled "F- the Chinese."
It was mid-July, and it had become routine to hear former President Donald Trump and other Republican leaders refer to the coronavirus pandemic as the "China virus" or "Kung flu" even after the phrases had been decried as racist.
The man continued with his xenophobic tirade, also referring to COVID-19 as the "China virus" until Harris-Russell cut him off, telling the stranger he was Vietnamese, not Chinese. At the same time, he said the man noticed the National Guard logo on Harris-Russell's license plate. The man apologized and walked away.
"I can't imagine if I was Chinese what could have happened to me," he said. "He could have gotten physical."
Harris-Russell shared the story publicly for the first time after a series of shootings at three Atlanta spas left eight people dead, including six Asian-American women. Though the shooting has not been officially deemed a hate crime, it heightened the awareness of racially-motivated violence against Asian Americans.
Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition that tracks different forms of hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United 
States reported nearly 3,800 incidents nationwide since the start of the pandemic.
Though local law enforcement agencies say there has not been a spike in violence against Asian Americans, the data from Stop AAPI Hate show that the vast majority of incidents recorded were verbal attacks, deliberate avoidance and online harassment, actions unlikely to be reported to police.
Since the Atlanta attack, Central Florida residents - descendants of China, Vietnam, Korea, Laos, the Philippines and Taiwan - have opened up about harassment that has largely not escalated to physical violence but made them feel less safe in recent months.
'I don't feel as safe'
Tai Hai Le said a stranger yelled racial slurs at him both in Orlando near the beginning of the pandemic and while he was traveling through a Texas airport.
Minkyung Chung, a mental health counselor who recently moved from Central Florida to Atlanta, said her family questioned if it was safe to leave home with masks - before Orange County made masks mandatory - for fear of harassment.
Dustin Sundara said he hasn't been attacked personally, but as a long-time gun owner, he bought a smaller one to conceal carry more often.
"If you look Asian in general you can be seen as a target," Sundara said. "Personally, I don't feel as safe. A lot of us are technically American. We work here. We pay taxes. Logically and rationally it doesn't make sense because we are all American."
Adrian Lee, a University of Central Florida junior and president of the Asian Pacific American Coalition, described an incident this year when another UCF student said he was approached late at night and asked if he was Vietnamese and if he had coronavirus.
"It's easy to brush away," said Lee of the incident that might seem minor if it isn't taken into context with the violence that has erupted against Asian Americans across the country.
"You really have to look at these incidents as a pattern in the way the pandemic has been racialized," she said.
Lee helped plan a vigil for 6:30 p.m. Tuesday on the University of Central Florida campus to honor the victims.
A legacy of anti-Asian discrimination
Investigators say accused shooter Robert Aaron Long, who is white, told police a sex addiction, not race, motivated the killings.
Still, Ryan Buyco, an Asian-American studies professor at Colorado College said the Atlanta incident is part of a centuries-long legacy of anti-Asian discrimination, sexism and sexualization.
"These attacks towards Asians and Asian Americans are new for a lot of us...but we have to understand they aren't new, and they are part of a longer history of anti-Asian racism in the United States," he said.
"It's not just the shooter in Atlanta, but also the murder of Vincent Chin," Buyco said, referencing the killing of a Chinese-American man who was beaten to death in Michigan in 1982.
"It goes back to the incarceration of Japanese Americans and to the [Chinese] exclusion laws [of the late 1800s]," he added.
The Page Act of 1875, specifically barred Chinese women from entering the country, because of the assumption that they were prostitutes and would "infect" the morality of white men, said Buyco.
"The shooting in Atlanta speaks to the sexist and racist history towards Asian women in particular, given that the suspect blamed his crime on his sexual addiction," said Buyco. "Seeing these women not as people, but as sources of temptation, draws from long-standing stereotypes against Asian women as hypersexualized and subservient to men."
For Le, who was twice verbally harassed since the start of the pandemic, he wants better treatment and more empathy for other Asian Americans.
"I hope that others can be mindful of the hardships and struggles that many Asian Americans face because of the boundaries systematically set in the United States that work against people of color," he said.
