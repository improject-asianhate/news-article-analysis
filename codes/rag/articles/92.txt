during the pandemic. This photo was taken at an anti-Asian hate rally in New York earlier this month.
Police in Oakland announced an arrest Tuesday in the brutal beating of a 75-year-old Asian man left brain dead,
Fox2 reported.
An assailant attacked a 75-year-old Asian man going for his daily morning stroll near Lake Merritt in Oakland,
across from San Francisco , CBS5 first reported
“That’s the guy that stays up the street, that walks every morning and every evening down the street bothering
nobody,” said neighbor Florence Williams who recognized the victim to Fox2.
“He’s elderly and he’s fragile,” said Elizabeth Seymour of Oakland. “You can see it.”
Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce President Carl Chan says he reached out to those close to the
victim’s family and says the man is brain dead.
“When I heard about this...it’s just so hurtful. I know people are saying that they’re angry. I’m not angry. I’m so
sad.”
This is just the latest in a string of attacks against elderly Asian Americans in the San Francisco Bay Area and
elsewhere in the country.
Mayor Libby Schaff Tuesday evening condemned the attack.
“This morning’s violent attack against an Asian American elder in our Adams Point neighborhood is
reprehensible,” Schaaf said. “Our police will investigate thoroughly to determine whether this was racially
motivated or a vile crime of opportunity. Every act of violence traumatizes our community, and I pray for healing
to the victim and his family.”
KCBS radio reports Oakland Police and Crime Stoppers of Oakland offered a reward of $5,000 for information
leading to an arrest in the case.
Authorities have no description of the suspect at this time.
