An Asian American restaurant owner in Atlanta says a customer sent her racist and threatening text messages, FOX 5 Atlanta reports. 
Tse-chih Chang, the owner of Grand China Restaurant, says she received racist text messages from a customer after explaining that it would take longer than usual to provide a refund. 
Last Sunday, a woman had called to cancel an order that was taking too long to deliver. Chang explained that they would cancel the order, but it would take a while to give the customer a refund, FOX 5 Atlanta reports. She assured the customer the refund would come eventually. 
The woman called the restaurant multiple times from two different numbers demanding a refund. When the refund finally went through, Chang texted a photo of the transaction to the woman's phone. That's when the harassing texts began. 
The woman called Chang an expletive, threatened to physically harm her and blamed her for COVID-19. 
Many Asian restaurants have faced racism and harassment since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
In March 2020, just a few weeks into lockdown, a Chinese restaurant in Washington had its windows smashed, NBC News reports. The vandal also left a message on the side of the building: "Take the corona back you ch*nk." 
A ramen restaurant in Texas was vandalized with racist phrases like "Go back to China" after its owner spoke out against lifting the state's mask mandate in March 2021, CBS News reports. 
"The community has to try to get along and support each other. We should respect each other, and we should not look down upon or trash any race," Chang told FOX 5 
Atlanta.
