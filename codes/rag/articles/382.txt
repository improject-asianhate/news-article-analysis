Authorities have charged a 26-year-old man with a hate crime for allegedly threatening Asian American postal worker who was delivering mail in Daly City, California, KTVU reports. 
The San Mateo County District Attorney's Office said Tuesday that officials had charged Lamont Demetrius West Verdon, of Oakland, with making criminal threats with a hate crime enhancement. 
Verdon allegedly threatened an Asian postal worker standing outside his United States Postal Service truck on June 5, CBS San Francisco reports. 
"F-k you, I'm going to kill you, you f-king Asian," prosecutors say Verdon shouted before rummaging through the postal worker's mail bag. 
The victim ran back to his mail truck, locked himself inside and called 911. Police arrested the suspect nearby. 
Verdon is being held at Maguire Correctional Facility in Redwood City on $1,000 bail, CBS San Francisco reports. He will be represented by a public defender. 
On Monday, Verdon plead not guilty to all charges at a preliminary hearing. His next court appearance is June 17.
