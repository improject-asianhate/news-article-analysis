Mark Tuan sometimes forgets he's not a normal 27-year-old guy living in the US state of California, and is surprised by things such as when his fans crashed the audio streaming platform Clubhouse after he signed up. 
Tuan is one-seventh of popular K-pop boy band Got7, and has just moved home from Seoul in South Korea to be close to his family as he starts a new stage in his career. He wants to use his platform to influence fans to change the world in a positive way. 
"It gets to me all the time," Tuan says about the fervour with which his fans support him. "I'm still not used to that, I've been doing this for, like, seven years now. You would think I'd get used to it, but it still surprises me that fans are still that crazy and supportive, and that we have that much power. It's super cool." 
Joining Clubhouse is just one of the many things Tuan has been trying lately: he and the rest of Got7 parted ways with their label JYP Entertainment this year after debuting with the South Korean company in 2014. The group plan to remain together, but each member is doing his own thing. 
For Tuan, that means moving home to the United States - which he left when he was a 16-year-old dreaming of superstardom - and figuring out who he is as a soloist. The star, who is of Taiwanese descent, recently launched a personal studio in China to grow his career in Chinese entertainment. 
"I think the biggest goal for me right now is to be able to find my sound. I'm not given a song now. I have to go out and make the song with people." 
Tuan is in the studio four or five days each week, and released One in a Million with Bangladeshi-American musician Sanjoy in February. In it, he shared thoughts on his life and his career. There'll be more of that on his upcoming, still-in-the-works album. 
"It's going to be about my journey, my career, everything. I think it will be super cool that fans can see a more personal side of me because I think I was pretty quiet." 
For Tuan, expressing himself aloud is a work in progress. "One time, the members got kind of upset with me. 'How come you never share your story or tell us about how you feel about anything?' I think having the six other boys there kind of made it more easy for me to open up." 
Tuan says moving home was a major comfort to him after being so far apart when it felt the most urgent to be with his loved ones. 
"I was worried a lot about the family during Covid. My parents both got the vaccine. And right now in the States, everyone's getting the vaccine so it seems like it's getting much safer." 
The pandemic isn't the only thing worrying Tuan when it comes to his family's safety. The star is concerned about the rising hate and violence directed at Asian-Americans. 
"I'm really scared for my parents. Having them go on their daily walks and stuff like that... it's scary. I hear stories about my friends, they have people that they know that have almost got attacked, and I have friends that hear racial comments." 
Tuan wants to use his platform to raise awareness of what's going on and how to bring about social justice and change. He recently donated US$30,000 to Stop AAPI Hate, a non-profit organisation that runs the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Centre, which tracks incidents of discrimination against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders. He's also donated to support Black Lives Matters in the past. 
"Right now, there's a lot of hate and violent acts towards Asian-Americans. Before this, it was Black Lives Matter ... it's difficult seeing so much hate and racism towards everybody. It doesn't matter what race you are, there's so much hate going around. I don't like seeing that. 
"Having people hear [about my donations] and making people more aware of stuff like this, I think it will at least contribute and help. Even if it helps just a little bit, I think that's what the main goal is right now." 
Although things are tough right now, he admits he's looking forward to living life as a twenty-something and working hard to develop his career with the support of family and friends, many of whom work with him. 
"I don't think it's a bad thing that I'm [physically] back at where I started when I went to Korea; I think it's pretty cool I get to learn new things. Being there, I grew up a lot and matured a lot. The biggest thing I learned is not to stress out too much about the outcome of things. Because if I do stress out, it kind of puts me in a bad mood." 
He pauses to play with his dog, who has been squeaking a toy loudly, and laughs as a PR rep on the call - one of his friends says, "Mark is a student of life". Playing with his dog and golfing are two ways he unwinds after stressing about work and his goals as he heads down this new path.
"Being in Korea and starting my career pretty early, it made me have that mindset to keep working harder no matter what. Whether the outcome [reaches] my expectations, I feel like that doesn't get to me as hard because I know I tried my hardest and I have no regrets about the outcome. 
"That's the biggest thing I have learned. If I want to do something, I gotta give it my all and have no regrets at the end."
