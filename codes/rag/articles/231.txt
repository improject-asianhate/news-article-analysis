On the streets you feel a lot of anxiety

Washington: As the representative for New York's 40th state assembly district, Ron Kim has seen the rise of anti-Asian harassment and violence up close since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Kim's district includes Flushing, a bustling neighbourhood in Queens that is renowned as the home of New York's most authentic Chinese food. More than six in 10 of his constituents are of Asian heritage, mostly Chinese and Korean.
"Asian Americans have been shoved and attacked in the downtown area of my district," says Kim, the only Korean American ever elected to New York's state legislature.
"Walking around the streets or on the subway you feel a lot of tension and anxiety."
When Americans began feeling concerned about the coronavirus in February 2019, New York mayor Bill de Blasio headed to a Chinese restaurant in Flushing to show his support for the Asian-American community.
Restaurants in the area were already reporting a drop-off in customers because of misguided fears that people could catch the virus from Chinese cooking.
De Blasio would later be ridiculed for encouraging people to gather in restaurants just as the virus was beginning to spread throughout the country. But he was right to be worried about growing discrimination against Asian Americans. Former president Donald Trump did not help by calling COVID-19 the "China virus" and the "kung flu".
The Stop Asian and Pacific Islander Hate group released a report last week showing it had recorded 3800 anti-Asian hate incidents over the past year. The vast majority were verbal harassment and shunning, but there were also hundreds of reports of physical violence.
The biggest spike occurred in New York City, which prides itself on being a progressive, multicultural melting pot. The attacks have continued even as coronavirus cases and hospitalisations plummeted in recent months.
In February there were four attacks against Asian-American women in New York on a single day. Two women were attacked on subways; one was pepper-sprayed while walking down the street; another was shoved to the ground.
The owner of Xian Famous Foods, a popular chain serving noodles and dumplings, revealed he had started closing earlier so his staff members could get home safely. Two of Jason Wang's employees were punched in the face in unprovoked attacks - something he said had never occurred before the pandemic.
"We have even young Asian Americans who refuse to leave their apartments in fear that they might be a target of a hate crime, that they might be spat on," Kim says. "There's a lot of trauma and stress, and it's not just older Asian Americans who feel it."
Yet until recently, the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans had received relatively little attention. The issue was eclipsed last year by the Black Lives Matter protests following George Floyd's death in Minneapolis.
That changed last week when a white man shot dead six Asian women working in massage parlours in Atlanta, Georgia. The shootings helped drive protesters across the country. Grey's Anatomy actress Sandra Oh attended a rally in Philadelphia where she urged Asian-American protesters to chant: "I am proud to be Asian! I belong here!"
Kim says the shootings in Atlanta are an imperfect example of the broader phenomenon of anti-Asian attacks. The shooter, a white evangelical Christian, has denied that race was a motivating factor in the attacks, telling police he was driven to kill by a sense of shame about his addiction to sex.
Kim adds that anti-Asian attacks in his district have often been carried out by members of other minority communities, complicating the racial dynamics of the issue.
"We're seeing a lot of young black and brown teenagers attacking older Asian adults," he says.
"We have a lot of work to do to let people in these communities know that Asian Americans are not the ones that caused their grief and their economic distress."
As much as he disliked Trump's inflammatory "China virus" rhetoric, the Democrat says it's too easy to heap all the blame on the former president.
"We can't just put on a Band-Aid, blame Trump and call it a day," Kim says. "That's not good enough."
