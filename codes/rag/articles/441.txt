Workers should know their employment rights during COVID-19

This week's question comes from Elena in Dolores Heights, San Francisco, who asks: My child's day care had to
close for a month due to COVID-19 exposure. I took time off from work to take care of my 4-year-old. When I
returned to work, my coworkers began treating me differently. They know about what happened at my child's
day care. When I walk in a room, I see them whispering to each other and/or they leave the room altogether, as
if to avoid me. One coworker specifically asked me if I had the "kung-flu." I am Asian American and I was
offended by this comment. Another coworker said that it wasn't fair that I got to take a "month-long vacation," I
verbally complained to my manager about the racist remark and being treated differently by my coworkers and
she assured me that she would take care of it.
A couple of weeks later, my manager told me that I was being transferred to the graveyard shift. My manager
knows that I cannot work that shift because I have a young child I told her that this was not fair and that I
thought I was being retaliated against for taking time off because of a COVID-19 closure of my child's day care
and/or complaining about my coworkers'racist remarks. She denied it and said that it was a business need, and
that my options are switching to the graveyard shift or quitting. I believe she is singling me out. I have been
working for this company for two years and have always had a great relationship with my manager prior to my
complaints. I don't know what to do. What are my rights?
Dear Elena: I'm so sorry that this is happening to you in the midst of what already is such a difficult year. The
Fair Employment and Housing Act prohibits discrimination and harassment based on race, national origin and disability (among others) in the workplace. The FEHA applies to public and private employers, labor
organizations and employment agencies with five or more employees. Employees also have the right to be
protected from retaliation for making a complaint or opposing a practice prohibited by the FEHA. Retaliation
includes any adverse employment action taken in response to an employee's complaint, including termination,
demotion, pay reduction, job transfer and negative performance evaluation. In other words, your employer
cannot punish you or treat you differently if you report race, national-origin or disability-based discrimination or
harassment in the workplace. Employers who violate the FEHA's anti-discrimination, harassment and retaliation
provisions may be liable for damages including back pay, lost benefits, emotional distress, punitive damages,
attorneys' fees and costs, etc.
Your complaint to your manager regarding the "kung-flu" comment made by your coworker and being treated
differently by coworkers due to taking leave of absence are considered a protected activity under the FEHA as it
is likely based on your race or national origin or as a perceived or associational disability. (COVID-19 can be a
disability, depending on how severe.) Your manager forcing you to transfer to the graveyard shift would be
considered an adverse employment action under the FEHA. The law requires proving a connection between
these two things. The fact that this happened just two weeks after your complaint is some evidence that it is
related to the protected activity.
Another source of protection may come from the Family First Coronavirus Response Act. The FFCRA, which
expanded the Family Medical Leave Act, covers leave and loss of income when an employee needs to care for
children because of school or childcare closure and other leave related to COVID-19. Employers with 500 or
fewer employees are required to provide job-protected leave for employees who are unable to work (or
telework) due to a need to care for the employee's child (under the age of 18) if the child's elementary or
secondary school or place of childcare has been closed, or the childcare provider is unavailable due to the
COVID-19 emergency. This applies to employees who have been employed by the employer for at least 30
calendar days. This means that employers are prohibited from discharging, disciplining, or otherwise retaliating
against any employee who takes leave under the FFCRA. Employers who violate the FFCRA's expanded FMLA
provision may be liable for damages including back pay, lost benefits, emotional distress, attorneys' fees and
costs, etc.
Assuming your employment has 500 or fewer employees, your leave of absence to take care of your minor child
during the daycare closure is protected by the FFCRA and retaliating against you with a transfer to a graveyard
shift is in violation of the FFCRA. We recommend that you contact an employment attorney to best protect your
rights and to ensure that you do not miss any filing deadlines.
