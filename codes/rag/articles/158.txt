Board member for Jugaad Leadership Program
As COVID-19 started to spread across American communities, so too did misinformation.
A prevalent rumor on social media was that black people can't get the coronavirus — which is particularly detrimental because black people are dying from COVID-19 at much higher rates than other races.
"So despite the fact that there are CDC guidelines out there and World Health Organization guidelines out there, there are communities that are getting misinformation," said Emmanuel Oppong. "So we are using our platform to state the facts."
Oppong, the community engagement director for the city of St. Cloud, is a board member for Jugaad Leadership Program, which trains and connects the next generation of leaders — specifically minority leaders — with members of local boards and commissions, as well as internships and employment.
The program is hosting a weekly online series, "Demystifying Cultural Myths." The first presentation, which focused on physical health amid the COVID-19 pandemic, launched Friday.
"It's meant to educate marginalized communities within Central Minnesota," Oppong said.
Friday's session featured Dr. Olayiwola R. Adetunji, a physician at CentraCare, who talked about the virus and how it spreads.
He also debunked myths he's heard — ranging from claims that gargling bleach can protect someone from the virus to claims that the virus is spread by mosquitoes.
He also addressed myths that people can contract the virus from eating Chinese food or that black people cannot get sick from the disease.
"The virus knows no race," Adetunji said.
Minnesota Department of Health statistics show white people make up more than 50% of confirmed cases in the state, while black people make up about 15% of cases.
But the data is constantly changing and not completely reliable — in nearly 20% of confirmed cases, the patient's race is unknown. But stories chronicling disparities are widespread.
In Louisiana, as USA Today reported last week, 70% of coronavirus-related deaths were black patients — even though they comprise less than a third of the state's population.
Minorities could be more vulnerable to complications from the COVID-19 virus because of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease, Adetunji said.
"Those will increase the severity of the illness and likewise the mortality," he said.
The Demystifying Cultural Myths series will stream from 5:30-6:30 Fridays via Zoom and Facebook Live.
After presenters share information, participants are able to ask questions. A recording will be available after the live event at www.facebook.com/jugaadleadership.
Upcoming sessions include emotional well-being, cross-cultural understanding and discrimination, transportation and public safety, and community resources and workforce.
Oppong, as well as Jugaad board members Eunice Adjei, Ryan Daniel, Dr. Sangeeta Jha and Jonathan Wong will present information and help lead discussions. "The series is meant to bridge-build," Oppong said. "We're connecting and sharing information with our audience."
Daniel, the chief executive officer at St. Cloud Metro Bus, will present on transportation.
"A lot of people are wondering why Metro Bus continues to operate," Daniel said. "Quite frankly, we are essential.
"Transportation is deemed an essential service," he continued. "We may not be essential to everyone, however, for transit-dependent people in our communities, we are the lifeline. We provide the link to get people to the hospital, medical appointments, the grocery store, to the essential jobs, etc."
Daniel said the transportation session will cover steps the organization is doing to protect drivers and riders — such as going fare-free to limit the use of frequently touched objects and having passengers use the rear door.
The session will also look ahead at what transportation might look like post-pandemic.
"Once this comes and goes, we're going to have to provide transportation in a different way," Daniel said. "We can't go fare-free forever so we're looking for alternatives."
A shared experience —but discrimination persists
Jha, a professor at St. Cloud Technical & Community College, will present on cross-cultural understanding.
"I am an anthropologist and a sociologist so for me culture is a concept which ... literally influences how we think about everything, including health," she said.
Despite cultural differences — and conflicts that sometimes arise due to those differences — everyone is going through a similar process of grappling with the pandemic.
"This is the first time, I would say, the entire world is in the same boat, the same situation, at least in my lifetime," she said. Still, discrimination persists.
"I have (Asian American) friends who are really afraid to go to a store and just clear their throat, or just cough or sneeze. I have a friend who doesn't go out for a walk because she is afraid to go out by herself," Jha said. "Basically, people are not feeling safe. ... There might not be reported cases (of discrimination) but this is going around."
Adjei, the program's founder, will focus on helping minority-owned small businesses tap into funding designated to help with COVID-19 fallout. "When it comes to small businesses, we know that minorities are the most affected ones," Adjei said.
For example, many minority-owned businesses are not eligible for relief due to requirements they have two or more staff because many businesses have family members helping out, Adjei said.
Although the series is only scheduled to last for another month, the Zoom meetings could continue "because we need a platform where we can talk about these cultural issues through a cross-cultural perspective," Jha said.
Ultimately, the goal is to create connections — even during a time of social distancing.
"We hope this will bring us together as a community to lean on each other and also learn from each other," Adjei said.
