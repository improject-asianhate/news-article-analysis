Asian-Americans report rise in hate crimes, fuelled, rights groups say, by President Donald Trump’s own rhetoric
On a normal weekday the streets of Manhattan’s Chinatown are filled with people spilling out from heaving restaurants. But for weeks now it has resembled a ghost-town.
“We were already down customers after the coronavirus was reported in China,” one restaurant owner told The Telegraph, “but in March we saw a big drop.”
The loss of business could partly be put down to people deciding to self-isolate at home, he figured, but delivery orders were down too, which made him suspect there was a more sinister reason.
Asian-Americans have reported a rise in hate crimes and discrimination as the US grapples with the growing health crisis, fuelled, rights groups say, by President Donald Trump’s own rhetoric.
Mr Trump, who has attempted to shift blame for the outbreak paralysing swathes of the country, onto Beijing, repeatedly calling Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and the “foreign virus”.
A close-up of the president's notes on Thursday even showed where the word "corona" had been crossed out and replaced with "Chinese" in black marker pen.
Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, meanwhile, has been referring to it as “Wuhan flu”.
John Cornyn, Republican senator for Texas, defended Mr Trump’s use of the term, saying: "China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the Swine Flu."
A White House official even called the virus the “Kung Flu” during a briefing with China-born American reporter from CBS News. “Makes me wonder what they’re calling it behind my back,” Weijia Jiang tweeted.
Members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus warned fellow lawmakers against contributing to "discriminatory language" after a senator suggested that the coronavirus had been created in a laboratory in China.
The World Health Organisation has advised against terms that link the virus to China or the city of Wuhan, where it was first reported, in order to avoid discrimination or stigmatisation.
Xinhua, China’s official news agency, said Mr Trump’s language was “racist and xenophobic” and revealed “politicians' irresponsibility and incompetence”, risking increasing fears over the virus.
Videos have been posted on social media of people riding the subway in New York harassing Asian commuters. One can be heard telling a woman wearing a face mask to “go home and stop infecting people”.
One Korean user joked that “being Asian on public transport was the new Arab”.

“My kids are being called ‘corona’ in school,” tweeted Jordan Matsudaira, former chief economist on Barack Obama’s Presidential Council of Economic Advisers.
To counteract the #Chinesevirus hashtag trending on Twitter, Asian users have begun using the global hashtag #JeNeSuisPasUnVirus--French for "I am not a virus."
Gun shops around the country have reported a rise in the number of Asian-Americans buying weapons, citing concerns they will face a backlash.
“People are panicking because they don’t feel secure. They worry about a riot or maybe that people will start to target the Chinese,” David Liu, a Chinese-American gun dealer outside Los Angeles, told the Trace.
Back in Chinatown, the latest figures show trade is down by as much as 70 per cent, and that was before New York’s governor issued a mandatory takeout and delivery only order for restaurants starting Tuesday.
Public health experts note that many reasons people cite for avoiding Chinese restaurants are unfounded and are a result of misinformation: people do not contract the virus through food originating in China.
The US has now recorded more than 8,000 cases across all 50 states, but the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) notes that "at this time, this virus is not currently spreading in the (Chinese) community in the United States."
Charissa Cheah, a professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Maryland, who is looking into the prejudice public health emergencies such as Covid-19 tend to reveal, told the Telegraph that Asian-American families in communities across the US have reported seeing a rise in abuse.
Parents tell her children are being ostracised by others and are afraid of openly showing any symptoms of illness for fear of being further shunned.
While viruses do not discriminate, there are many examples through history of immigrant populations being discriminated against during outbreaks: Jewish communities were targeted during the bubonic plague in the 1300s, Irish immigrants were blamed for typhoid in the 1800s, and West Africans for Ebola in 2014.
Ms Cheah said that Mr Trump’s use of language has refuelled historical racist tropes.
“In times of fear, people react in ways that reinforce group identity and stereotypes about ‘The Other'. Asian-Americans have always been treated as the other, the perpetual foreigner, regardless of how many generations they have been in the US," she said.
“We are trying to educate people in communities with Asian populations that this thinking is wrong. But it’s hard when the leader of the country is effectively validating this discrimination.”
