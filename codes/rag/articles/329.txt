Clara Kan and her mother were just beginning a seaside stroll last week in Richmond, B.C., when two men in a car hurled a racial slur at them and shouted: "Go back to China."
The women, who were wearing masks, confronted the driver, an older white man, who then revved the engine and lurched the car toward Ms. Kan before driving off.
Ms. Kan's 65-year-old mother screamed for help and the men drove off. Ms. Kan immediately reported the incident to the RCMP.
Since the altercation, she says, her mother is scared to resume their daily walks in public parks and only feels comfortable shopping at Chinese supermarkets, where the majority of other shoppers are East Asian.
Ms. Kan is adamant that she will never remain silent about the kind of abuse she, her mother and many other East Asian Canadians are facing.
"What concerns me most is a lot of Chinese people or Asian people they're like, â€˜Oh, let it go, just walk away,' but I feel like maybe in a way because I was bold enough to confront these racists maybe that's why physical violence didn't occur," says Ms. Kan, 33.
