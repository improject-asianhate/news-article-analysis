Authorities arrested a man who they say is suspected of stabbing two Asian women without warning in downtown San Francisco on Tuesday.

Officers were sent to 4th and Stockton streets shortly before 5 p.m. and found the wounded women were taken to a hospital, SFPD police spokesman Michael Andraychak said in a statement to USA TODAY.

Witnesses told KPIX-TV that a man clutching a knife was walking down Market Street when he approached a bus stop, stabbed the women, and then walked away.

54-year-old Patrick Thompson was arrested for the incident after a two-hour search, police told the Associated Press.

San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin said on Twitter that his office is "still receiving the case" but expects to announce charges against Thompson on Thursday.

Neither he nor other authorities indicated whether the women were specifically targeted or whether the attack might be a hate crime.

The two women, who are 63 and 84 respectively, remained hospitalized Wednesday. The 84-year-old was initially treated for life-threatening injuries but her medical status has been upgraded to non-life-threatening, police said.

A GoFundMe set up by her grandchildren has currently raised almost $37,000 for her medical bills. Her granddaughter said in the description that she had been waiting for the bus and had been stabbed in the arm and chest.
