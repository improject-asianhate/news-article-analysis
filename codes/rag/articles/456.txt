Earlier in February, a 36-year-old Asian man was stabbed in the back in Manhattan's Chinatown. Watching the replay of the attack, I realized that the victim could have been me an Asian man who walked alone in the same area a year ago.

Although Asians and Asian-Americans have been continuously attacked amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, hate crime charges by these communities are very rare. A survey published in 2020 found that 31% of Asian American adults have been subjected to racial slurs, yet only 3,800 hate crime reports were received by the Stop AAPI Hate organization in the past year - a very small percentage of 22 million Asian Americans. 
A reason behind victims' hesitancy to report an incident is the element of behavior in connection to race. Oftentimes, the older generation of Asian immigrants is the quiet minority who might not feel the need to stand up for themselves. "My difficulty, or reluctance, in speaking about my anger isn't because I'm not infuriated, (but because) I've been trained to suppress my rage," expressed Claudine Ko, an editor at the New York Times. Addressing this point of view of older Asian immigrants and Asian Americans can help change reporting patterns of the future. 
The solution starts with the Asian immigrants' children, a younger generation who may be more politically engaged and can use their involvement to change their parents' behavior. But what if the children themselves are the quiet people who cannot manage to have sensitive 
conversations with their parents? A study conducted by Asian American researchers found that Asian American college students have very low utilization rates of mental health services despite showing high levels of psychological distress. In fact, Asian American females from 15 to 24 years old have the highest rate of depressive symptoms among young women. 
If we can promote mental health services better and target the needs of Asian and Asian American college students, we can help students realize the importance of mental health and the need to discuss serious topics like racism. At the University of Rochester, the president expressed her condolences to the AAPI community after the Atlanta shooting and reiterated on-campus mental health resources. Workshops led by Asian voices and a candlelight vigil were hosted by student organizations to address recent hate crime incidents and to let students share their feelings. Besides these steps, higher education institutions should also promote online resources allowing for direct participation in antiracist activities. Reporting hate crime incidents at Stop AAPI Hate and donating to the Hate Is A Virus organization are just some of the many steps that could be advocated for. 
It is time for Asians and Asian Americans, regardless of our age, to un-suppress our rage and speak about our thoughts, loud and clear.
