The stories are horrific. 
A shooting rampage that killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women, in Atlanta. An elderly Asian woman kicked in her stomach and stomped in the face in broad daylight in New York. A Thai immigrant in his 80s, fatally shoved to the ground in San Francisco. And an 89-year-old Chinese woman slapped in the face and set on fire in Brooklyn, N.Y. 
A string of recent hate crimes against Asian-Americans has the nation grappling with how to address and confront the issue. And following a year of racist rhetoric toward people of Asian descent amid the coronavirus pandemic, stories of blatant discrimination against the minority group have increasingly come to forefront. 
But Asian-Americans haven't just been targeted during the pandemic, An Chung Cheng, a Spanish professor at the University of Toledo, told The Blade on Friday. Systemic discrimination against Asian-Americans has persisted for years, she said. 
What happened in the past year is not only just because of the pandemic, or hate rhetoric, Ms. Cheng said. All of this can be rooted back in history. 
Ms. Cheng and four other panelists will give a presentation on Asian-American discrimination and have an open dialogue at a virtual town-hall discussion Tuesday. The program, Stop Anti-Asian Hate, The Fight to Eliminate Racism in All Forms, will tackle systemic and institutionalized discrimination against Asian-Americans, and look at some of the problem's roots, Ms. Cheng said. 
According to Stop Hate AAPI, an activist organization that labels itself as a reporting center created to track and respond to hate crimes against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States, 3,795 reports of hate incidents were documented in the country during the 12 months that ended with February. It's a number that doesn't take into account for other hateful incidents that aren't even classified as hate crimes. 
It's very difficult to prosecute hate crimes, Ms. Cheng said. But it doesn't mean that hate crimes don't exist or prejudice 
against Asian-Americans doesn't exist. 
We would like to increase the dialogue, she added. Because of the violence against Asian-Americans, particularly to the most vulnerable groups like elders, the Asian-American community is starting to feel like we need to stand up. 
In March, 2020, the FBI warned of a potential surge in hate crimes against Asian-Americans during the pandemic. That didn't stop many elected officials from using hateful rhetoric many activist groups say encourages bigotry and hate towards Asians. 
Former President Trump began the verbal attacks in 2020, referring to the coronavirus as the China Virus, Chinese virus, and Kung Flu. Several Republicans followed suit. Just last week, Ohio Lt. Gov. Jon Husted referred to the coronavirus as the Wuhan Virus, in a tweet and later doubled down on the message, explaining he only meant to criticize the Chinese government. 
But that rhetoric sends the wrong message to Americans, Ms. Cheng said, and in some cases has severe consequences. 
The general public does not know who is Chinese, or Korean, or Japanese, she said. And so all of us who look like Asians will be targeted, and be scapegoats, and be blamed for the pandemic. 
Federal hate-crime data has not yet been released for 2020. Hate crimes in 2019 were the highest in more than a decade. 
Sara Clark, director of UT's center for international studies and programs, will moderate the discussion, which takes place virtually at noon on Tuesday and can be streamed via Webex. 
In addition to Ms. Cheng, the panel will feature: Joseph Hara, director of UT's Japanese program; Hua Liu Sowa, an education student at UT; Carolyn Sowa, a Toledo native who is studying international law at Beijing University, and Xinren Yu, assistant director for UT's center for international studies and programs. 
The town hall is the 13th in a UT series of discussions called Dialogues on Diversity, that began after George Floyd, a Black man, was controversially killed by a police officer in Minneapolis last year.
