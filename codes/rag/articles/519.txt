A home in northeast Louisville, Kentucky, has been vandalized with anti-Asian slurs, ABC 11 reports. 
Todd Blankenship opened his door around 11 a.m. on Saturday, April 24, to find the words "GO HOME, Chinese communists," and other racial slurs spray-painted in yellow across his home. 
Blankenship lives in the home with his Thai American wife Sassy and their three children. Sassy has a green card and is currently going through the process of becoming a citizen, according to WLKY. 
Sassy has lived in America for the past four years. In those four years, she says she has never experienced discrimination until now. 
"I feel sad because I don't understand. I am Thai, I am an Asian woman. I did not hurt anyone. I did not do anything bad," Sassy told ABC 11. 
Blankenship said he didn't think this type of incident happened in their "nice neighborhood.‚Äù He added that the hardest part of the situation is explaining it to his daughter. 
"We've been married for five years, and the hardest part of this whole thing is I had to have a conversation with my 4-year-old daughter this morning about why someone didn't like her because of the color of her skin," he told WLKY.
