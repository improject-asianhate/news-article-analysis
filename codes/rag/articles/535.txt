Shutdowns, attacks create subdued New Year

Festivities for the Lunar New Year holiday, normally East Asia's busiest tourism season, are muted after China,
Vietnam, Taiwan and other governments tightened travel curbs and urged the public to avoid big gatherings
following renewed coronavirus outbreaks.
In China, Buddhist and Daoist temples that are usually packed with holiday worshippers are closed. Streets in
major cities were largely empty.
Ji Jianping, 62, was among those gathering outside the locked gates of the Tibetan-style Lama Temple on
Beijing's north side to burn incense and pray. She said she and her family skipped visiting their home town in
the northern province of Shanxi due to the pandemic.
The government's appeal to China's public to avoid travel is denting spending on tourism and gifts. But
economists say the overall impact might be limited if factories, shops and factories keep operating instead of
taking their usual two-week break.
The commerce ministry said 48 million more people in Chinese cities planned to celebrate where they lived
instead of travelling.
The China State Railway Group said railway journeys were down by almost 70 per cent from last year.
Departures from Beijing's two major airports were down 75 per cent.
In Taiwan, merchants said sales were up 10 to 20 per cent because people were celebrating at home with family
dinners instead of travelling abroad.
Meanwhile, police are stepping up patrols and volunteers are increasing their street presence after several
violent attacks on older Asians that have stoked fear in San Francisco Bay Area Chinatowns and subdued the
Lunar New Year mood.
Shops and restaurants are typically bustling in Chinatowns across the United States at this time of year, but the
pandemic and safety concerns have dampened the festive atmosphere.
City officials have visited Chinatowns in San Francisco and Oakland this week to address residents' safety
concerns and condemn the violence. They have vowed to combat a problem that has been simmering since the
start of the pandemic but sparked new outrage after two unprovoked attacks were caught on video within a few
days.
In one, a man shoved Vicha Ratanapakdee to the ground as he was taking his morning walk in San Francisco's
Anza Vista neighbourhood on January 28. The 84-year-old Thai man's head struck the pavement, and he later
died in hospital. Prosecutors have charged a 19-year-old with murder and elder abuse.
On January 31, a security camera caught a man wearing a hooded sweatshirt barrelling into a 91-year-old Asian
man in Oakland's Chinatown, causing him to fall face down on to the footpath. Police have arrested a suspect,
and said he had assaulted a couple on the same block later that day, and another on February 1.
In just the last two weeks, authorities had recorded 18 crimes against Asian-Americans around Oakland's
Chinatown, said Nancy O'Malley, district attorney for Alameda County.
The recent attacks represent the latest spike in verbal and physical attacks against Asian- Americans since the
coronavirus, which emerged in China, reached the US. Stop AAPI Hate, launched by two advocacy groups to
encourage Asian-Americans to report such incidents, has documented more than 3000 attacks to date.
The California attacks have prompted volunteers to offer to walk older residents to their cars or homes after
shopping. Jacob Azevedo said more than 200 people signed up after he posted the idea on social media. They
also donated thousands of dollars to help him buy personal alarms for older Asians. - AP
