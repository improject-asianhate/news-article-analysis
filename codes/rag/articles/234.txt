Palm Desert's mayor and council members denounced the "hateful acts" of a group of women who used profanities and mocked the Korean accent of a longtime resident and restaurant owner this week when she asked them to leave at closing time.
"Behavior such as this does not represent the values of Palm Desert," Mayor Kathleen Kelly said during Thursday's City Council meeting.
The incident occurred Monday night at Musashi Japanese Restaurant and Sushi Bar on Highway 111 in Palm Desert, where owner Stella Kim said she had a run-in with three customers, all women, who came in for dinner early in the evening.
The women dined inside and remained at the table talking long after their meal had been served, Kim told The Desert Sun on Friday. The restaurant closes at 9:30 p.m. and by 9 p.m., the three women were the only customers remaining, Kim said.
When staff began preparing to close — putting up the chairs, sweeping the floor and cleaning — the women continued to chat among themselves, she said.
When Kim heard them call Uber for a ride, "I said, 'Ladies, can you wait for Uber outside, please?'" Kim said.
They got up to leave without saying anything, and Kim said she thanked them.
Then, one of the women came back in to use the restroom and began complaining to Kim about the food saying it was horrible, they had to wait too long and would not be back.
"I told her, 'That's fine,'" Kim said.
The woman continued to complain and argue, cursed at Kim and began mocking her Korean accent, Kim said.
"I have never had this experience in Palm Desert," said Kim, who moved to the Coachella Valley in 1993, opening her restaurant — one of two — in 1996.
"I have such good customers and I never felt they looked down on me," Kim said.
She and her husband raised their children in Palm Desert, and said none of them have experienced racism in the valley.
"I'm very happy to have raised my children in this valley," she said.
Racial attacks — verbal and physical — on Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have been on the rise, largely fueled by people who say they blame people of Asian descent for the COVID-19 pandemic.
There have been reports of Asian people being recently attacked in the Los Angeles area and on March 16 eight people, including six Asian women, were killed when a gunman opened fire in three spas during a spree that spanned the Atlanta area. Authorities continue to investigate the suspect's motives.
The Indio City Council may soon consider a resolution condemning racism and violence against Asian Americans in the east valley city, as a result of the Georgia shootings.
Kim said the three women, all white, had never before been in Musashi.
Mayor: 'We abhor all hateful acts'
When Kelly heard of the incident, she issued a written statement Thursday which she later read during the City Council meeting.
"We abhor all hateful acts. A hateful act toward any of us diminishes us all. Diversity with its varied experiences, perspectives and languages is a vital asset of this community," Kelly said.
The city in 2020 adopted "Unite Palm Desert" as its mantra and guiding principal, Kelly said.
"Over the last 12 months, much of our focus under the 'Unite Palm Desert' banner has been about holding up those most affected by the pandemic with essential support," Kelly said.
"But 'Unite Palm Desert' is about much more than that. It encourages our whole community to embrace the principles of mutual respect expressed in city of Palm Desert Resolution No. 2018-09, in which we affirmed that this city will not tolerate prejudice, racism, bigotry, hatred, bullying and violence towards any groups within our community."
National Public Health Week is commemorated April 4-10, which Kelly said makes it timely to affirm that much more than physical well-being contributes to public health.
She and the City Council on Thursday presented a proclamation "imploring us all to recommit ourselves to achieving a fully healthy community in which people of all ethnicities, identities and backgrounds consistently enjoy equal respect."
Other council members also commented on the incident involving Kim.
"This personally, as an English learner, is something that spoke to me, as somebody who has been told, 'Learn English. Speak English. Go back to your country.' These are things that I have heard, that my family has heard," Councilmember Karina Quintanilla said.
When someone speaks to her with an accent, Quintanilla said, "I hear hope, I hear hard work, I hear determination, and that's what an accent means to me."
Mayor Pro Tem Jan Harnik said she has known Kim and her family for a long time.
"Their children graduated from Palm Desert High, they've been great supporters of the high school; they've been great community members and it's a great family and they're wonderful people," Harnik said. "I know Stella well and ... it's hard for me to even understand how anybody could say that to the caliber of human being that Stella is."
Councilmember Sabby Jonathan said he is an immigrant who has been "the recipient of hate throughout my life. But you know, I always felt that those who hate and do these bad things to other people do not represent our city, the Coachella Valley or our country."
Kim said she appreciates the city's support.
"I don't want to make a big deal about this ... but this is upsetting," she said.
