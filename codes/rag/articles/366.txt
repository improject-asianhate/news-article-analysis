An Asian woman is speaking out after being shoved into a moving vehicle in New York City's Chinatown, ABC 7 reports. 
Last Monday, September 13, a 28-year-old Asian woman was standing on the corner of Eldridge and Grand Street in Chinatown around 2:40 p.m. 
The woman looked both ways as she prepared to cross the street. A video shows the female suspect standing behind the woman. At the right moment, she shoves the Asian woman into a moving vehicle. 
The victim's only physical injury was a bruised knee, but she told ABC 7 the incident left her traumatized. A few days after she began questioning what had happened to her. 
"I started having self-doubts," she told ABC 7. "I didn't go to work for a couple days. I started thinking too much, like over thinking, replaying the scenario. And I thought to myself, did I see her somewhere before, down the street, did I bump into her? Did I cut her off at the stop light and I just didn't know? All that was getting in my head." 
The victim isn't sure why she was assaulted, but she does wonder if being an Asian American in Chinatown may have had an influence. 
Attacks on Asian Americans in New York City have persisted throughout the pandemic. In June, a man punched a 55-year-old Asian woman unprovoked on the sidewalk, NBC News reports.
