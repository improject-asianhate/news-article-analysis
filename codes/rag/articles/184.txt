SEYMOUR —A local family confronted with apparent racially motivated threats at their Asian restaurant has been overwhelmed by the community response.
“I didn’t expect the community to react the way that it did,” said Meng Zheng, whose parents Ju Zheng and Xuemei Chen own Sushi & Wok. “I’m glad that it did, though.”
The restaurant has been swamped with orders, received more than 150 messages of support on social media and got an offer of $1,000 to be used to pay for the meals of local emergency responders and health workers.
The incident that put it all into motion occurred April 3 just before noon, Zheng said. “It was right as the lunch rush was starting,” she said.
The restaurant received six calls from two different phone numbers blaming Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic and threatening to shoot up the restaurant in a profanity-filled rant, she said. The caller also seemed to be trying to disguise his voice, Zheng said.
The calls were sufficiently alarming that her parents called Zheng at her job at Yale New Haven Hospital.
She notified the police and relayed the information since there is a language barrier. Seymour police confirmed a report had been filed but did not respond to a request for further details.
Later, Zheng said, she began growing angry that her family had been the target of racial bias and took to the restaurant’s Facebook page to vent.
“As we struggle to keep our business open, not only do we face the challenges of paying rent and dues, but we also deal with harassments from people who threaten to do harm to our employees and business,” she wrote. “Many people have no idea how difficult it is to continue operating a small restaurant with the constant fear that someone will come in and tear the place down. There is no need to spread ignorance, hatred, and destruction in our community in a time like this.”
  The response was immediate.
“I’m so sorry that some individuals have so much hate in their hearts and are so ignorant as to blame an entire culture for something that is a worldwide issue,” wrote Alison Vance, a customer since the restaurant opened in 2013. “Much love to you and your family.”
Julie Mary agreed.
“This broke my heart to read,” she wrote. “No one is immune to this virus; it does not discriminate. I think it’s fair to say it’s showing us all of us are equals. No one should be threatening anyone, least of all the people are working hard to continue to provide food to their community.”
Jacklyn Meeker was more blunt.
“Don’t let all the (expletives) bring you down,” she wrote.
Though the night passed without incident, Zheng said the community support ironically caused her a brief moment of alarm.
“I called around 5 o’clock to check in, and no one answered the phone, the line was just dead,” she said. “I texted and called their cellphones, and when no one replied I rushed over there. It was probably an overreaction, but I was thinking the worst-case scenario.”
Everyone at the restaurant was fine, just busy, she said.
“So many people were calling and ordering from them, I ended up staying there and working for the night,” she said.
After work, Zheng made a follow-up post thanking the Seymour Police Department for having a patrol car check in on the restaurant throughout the night.
A few days later, the town’s Board of Selectman took time in their April 7 meeting to voice their support for her parents’ restaurant.
“These people are Seymour residents just as much as all of us,” First Selectman Kurt Miller said to the board. “There is no place for this negativity in town, and I love seeing all the support.”
Miller chalked the threats up to a “keyboard warrior,” a slang term generally used to describe someone who makes aggressive comments online, where he can conceal his identity.
Other selectmen echoed the sentiment, referring to the threats as “reprehensible” and expressing their pride at the community’s coming together behind the family.
Tom Haynes, owner of a local construction materials and hardware business, took note of the incident and was waiting at the restaurant when it opened April 8, offering $1,000 to buy meals for health care workers and emergency responders.
Zheng said the family was grateful for the offer, and was trying to think of a way to implement the donation since they currently have no way of knowing who is placing orders.
“We’re only accepting orders through the apps right now,” she said.
Perhaps, when the pandemic subsides, the donation could be used to host a thank-you party for those who fought the virus, Zheng said. “That would be great,” she said.
