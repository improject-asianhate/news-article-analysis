Case may combine rare hate-crime charge with insanity defense

FOND DU LAC - The case against a man charged with killing a retired police officer by hitting him with his pickup
truck could combine two rare elements in a Wisconsin court case: a hate-crime charge and an insanity defense.
Prosecutors say the killing of retired police officer Phillip A. Thiessen, 55, of Fond du Lac is a hate crime because

Thiessen was targeted because of his race — Thiessen was white and defendant Daniel Navarro, a Mexican-
American, told police he intended to kill a white person.

Statements Navarro is accused of making to police immediately after the crash — unless his attorney can get a
judge to throw them out — would likely eliminate several potential defenses.
"Navarro stated he intentionally crashed into the motorcycle, head-on," District Attorney Eric Toney said in a
criminal complaint. Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Sgt. Logan Will, who spoke with Navarro minutes after the July
3 crash, said Navarro told him, "It was intentional, sir."
Navarro's truck left no skid marks or other signs he tried to avoid Thiessen before a head-on collision on
Winnebago Drive in Taycheedah, the complaint says. There is no evidence the two knew each other before the
crash.
Prosecutors also say Navarro said white people had been harassing him, "giving him acid" and contaminated
him with a chemical sterilizer.
Navarro, 27, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide with a deadly weapon as a hate crime, and first-
degree recklessly endangering safety with a dangerous weapon, as a hate crime. He is in Fond du Lac County

Jail in lieu of $1 million bond.
Navarro is due in county circuit court on Wednesday for arraignment.
The law since 1988
Hate-crimes — crimes motivated by bigotry — became illegal under a measure the state Legislature adopted in
1988.
Then Rep. David Clarenbach, D-Madison, authored the bill after incidents including cross burnings, the painting
of a swastika on a synagogue and the killing of a white woman walking in a mall parking lot with a Black man,
according to a 1988 report in the Janesville Gazette.
"If a man is assaulted because he is Black," Clarenbach said, "the penalty for assault should be enhanced to
reflect the intimidation connected with the crime."
Hate crimes "enhancers," as they are known, allow increased fines and prison time for crimes that target people
because of race and ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability or gender. A judge can add up to $5,000,
and/or an additional five years in prison to the sentence of someone convicted of a hate-crime felony.
Race and ethnicity remain the most common reasons for hate crimes in the state, and in the nation, statistics
show.
Nationally, the FBI says, Blacks were the targets of 1,943 hate crimes in 2018 — more than any other race,
figures show. Next are whites, at 762, and Latinos, at 485.
Perhaps the state's best-known hate crime is the August 2012 mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in
Oak Creek, near Milwaukee. A white supremacist killed six people, including four priests, and wounded four
others before killing himself after being shot by an Oak Creek police officer.
Another victim, paralyzed in the attack, died earlier this year.
Today, though, Wisconsin's hate-crime cases remain fairly rare, U.S. Justice Department figures show.
Since 2014, when 51 were reported, the numbers declined for two years, then nudged back up to 46 in 2017,
and rose again to 53 in 2018, the most recent year for which figures were available.
Hate crimes, insanity defense
When he spoke to deputies at the crash scene, and detectives later that night, Navarro told sheriff's officials he
hadn't nodded off at the wheel. Nor did he claim Thiessen was riding in a way that would have caused Navarro
to think he needed to defend himself against the motorcyclist, based on what witnesses told police.
That limits his options in terms of a criminal defense, meaning his best defense might involve employing an
"insanity defense" — making the case about his mental condition.
That approach — pleading not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, commonly labeled an "insanity
defense" or "NGI" — is available, but rarely used. Black's Law Dictionary says it's employed in less than 1% of
Wisconsin criminal cases.
Defense Attorney Jeffrey Jensen wasn't available for comment but had indicated after a brief court proceeding in
July that he might consider a defense based on Navarro's mental health.
In an insanity defense, the defendant must admit he or she committed the crime. A defense attorney must then convince the court that his client couldn't understand his actions were wrong, and couldn't stop himself from
committing the crime.
The defense could also convince a court the defendant knew his actions were wrong but couldn't "conform his
conduct to the law" — something Marquette University Law Professor Michael O'Hear called "the irresistible
impulse."
At trial, both sides will call expert witnesses who've examined the defendant. The defense's expert will likely
testify that the defendant should be found not guilty because of his mental condition and the prosecution's
will disagree.
Even then, a successful insanity defense won't necessarily keep a defendant from being locked up for a long
time. Defendants who are found guilty, but not responsible, are typically confined to a psychiatric institution,
not released into the community or sent to prison. And in Wisconsin cases where a jury accepts an insanity
defense, a judge can reject that finding.
Kenneth Freeman of Milwaukee was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect this year for killing
Froedtert Hospital nurse practitioner Carlie Beaudin, 33, as she walked to her car after a 2019 shift at the
hospital. A judge in Milwaukee County sentenced Freeman in March to spend the rest of his life in a secure
mental facility.
Wisconsin's best known — and perhaps only — hate-crime case to employ an insanity defense resulted in
three life sentences plus 20 years for a Milwaukee County man who gunned down neighbors Phia and Mai Vue
and Jesus Manso-Perez, and tried to kill a fourth in a racially motivated attack. Jurors rejected Dan Popp's
claim that mental illness kept him from acting lawfully.
Insanity-defense cases usually involve testimony about the defendant's mental health over time. Should
Navarro employ such a defense, it could pose challenges.
As USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reported in July, Navarro's family, a prosecutor, and a judge had raised
concerns in the past about Navarro's mental state. But while multiple people raised red flags, there was little
immediate evidence that he had undergone an evaluation.
His sister in 2019 had described him to Fond du Lac police as a germophobe who wouldn't pick something up
without paper towels or toilet paper in his hands. Another relative told authorities a doctor had recommended

he have a mental health evaluation. And the Fond du Lac County circuit judge overseeing his 2019 disorderly-
conduct case had ordered a psychological evaluation.

But when one a test was not conducted in the time called for under law, the judge released Navarro from jail
and withdrew the order.

Recent Wisconsin hate crimes
Wisconsin has seen some hate-driven crimes of violence recently. Some exhibit an element of pre-planning.
Milwaukee resident Clifton Blackwell, 62, is set for trial in November on a felony charge of first-degree
reckless injury as a hate crime. Prosecutors say he threw acid in the face of 42-year-old U.S. citizen Mahud
Villalaz outside a Milwaukee restaurant last fall after making anti-immigrant remarks and accusing Villalaz of
"invading" the U.S.
Villalaz suffered facial burns. He has recovered.
In late June, 18-year-old Althea Bernstein told Madison police she was approached at a light by four white
men; she said one sprayed her with a flammable liquid. Bernstein, who is biracial, said a man threw a lit
match or lighter at her, briefly setting her face and neck on fire, the Associated Press reported.
City police and the FBI are investigating that as a possible hate crime. At least $15,000 in reward money
has been posted for information leading to the capture of a suspect.
Small city hate crimes
Hate crimes aren't just a big city problem in Wisconsin.
In June, Marathon County prosecutors charged Aaron Nielson, 51, of Wausau, with misdemeanor battery
and disorderly conduct, after an attack on a biracial man outside a Wausau convenience store. Joseph
Murphy, who is Menominee Indian and Black, said Nielson scuffled with him after approaching and uttering
racial slurs. Witnesses confirmed Murphy's account.
In May, a Stevens Point man was accused of a hate crime in connection with the verbal harassment of
Asian-Americans at a Point grocery store. Police told Wisconsin Public Radio that harassment of the local
Hmong population has increased since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic earlier this year.
Also, someone in February 2019 posted a racist, anti-Islamic slur on a building housing a La Crosse taxicab
company run by Mike Ahmad, a Muslim. The graffiti included a common anti-Black slur.
Some charges don't stick
Not all Wisconsin cases charged as hate crimes result in hate-crime convictions.
A former De Pere man who initially was accused of a hate crime after yelling a racial slur and shooting at a
man in downtown Green Bay in 2017 was convicted of two felonies and a misdemeanor. The hate crime
enhancer was withdrawn after authorities agreed that the slur was more likely the result of the defendant's
intoxication.
