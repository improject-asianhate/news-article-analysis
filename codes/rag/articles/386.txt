A Filipino man says he was punched and told to go back to his home country on a Manhattan subway, ABC7 reports. 
He says the attack happened at around 7:20 a.m. when he got off the 6 train at the 103rd Street station on the Upper East Side. He saw someone attacking an Asian man and shouting "go back to where you came from." 
The attacker approached the Filipino man after his first victim escaped and punched him repeatedly. 
"Go back to where you came from," the attacker allegedly shouted at the victim. 
The man asked ABC 7 not to reveal his name or his face. He did however show his bloody face mask a proof of the attack. 
This is the latest in a number of attacks against Asian Americans in New York City. In March, an Asian man was pushed onto the subway tracks in Queens, according to ABC 7. That same month, a Filipina woman was kicked and beaten outside an apartment building, The New York Times reports.
