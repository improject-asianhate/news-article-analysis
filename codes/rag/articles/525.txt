Asian-Americans must unite and end timid stereotype: Jodi Xu Klein says the lack of a shared struggle has muted the many Asian voices in America

Last month, in the wake of the killing of six Asian women at a spa in Atlanta, Georgia, the United States woke up to the hostility Asian-Americans have lived with since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. 
As people grappled with the shocking surge in verbal and physical attacks targeting Asians, some major news outlets attributed the slow emergence of the worsening situation to the quiet nature of Asian people. 
But that story was incomplete and inaccurate. What had prevented these incidents from surfacing faster was less about the shyness of Asians. What had been exposed was a fragmented Asian community. While Asians are looked upon as the same in the eyes of the West, they are not monolithic - far from it. 
Each Asian nation has its own unique heritage. Their people have different sets of struggles and at times have struggled against each other. The Chinese and the Koreans felt strong resentment against Japan for its government's mass killings during World War II. These memories are very much alive and continue to haunt trade, economic and interpersonal relationships. 
These dynamics are also reflected among Asian immigrants in the US. Some 20 million Asian Americans trace their roots to more than 20 countries in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent, according to the Pew Research Centre. 
Many Asians in the US are first-generation immigrants, and new immigrants also typically participate less with other members of society outside their family group as they tend to be focused on making a living in their new country. 
Asian-Americans have not been united by an inclusive, singular identity. They are a collection of people from Asia who live in the same country. There has been a lack of a sense of cause or shared struggle. This is the main dynamic that has muted the many voices of US Asian communities. 
After the deadly Georgia shooting, that sense of common cause has been growing. Asian-Americans in Congress have loudly condemned the crimes. One memorable moment came when Grace Meng, a Democrat from New York, called out the violence and discrimination at a hearing on Capitol Hill in March. 
"Our community is bleeding. We are in pain," she said. She told a panel that the rising tide of anti-Asian bigotry was fuelled partly by rhetoric from former US president Donald Trump, who repeatedly referred to Covid-19 as the "China virus" and "kung flu”. Other lawmakers such as Bee Nguyen and Sam Park also spoke out against race- based hate crimes. 
It is true that Asian culture might be less confrontational than others, but that should not be confused as a sign of weakness. Anyone following the protests in Myanmar can see that their battles for democracy are loud, persistent and at times brutal. Many protesters are willing to give up their lives for a cause bigger than themselves. There is nothing shy and timid about that. 
Many in the US can attest to that quiet bravery. Senator Tammy Duckworth, a Thai-American, lost her legs serving in the Iraq war. Lee Wong, an Asian-American Army veteran, bared his chest during a meeting in West Chester, Ohio, last month to show the vicious-looking scars he sustained from his service. 
It is simplistic for the media to explain away an invisibility problem with Asian shyness. That is a stereotype and, more accurately, a form of racism in itself. 
The bloodshed in Georgia might be the needed moment for Asian unity. Since that massacre, Asians have grown more vigilant and more clear-headed about keeping their loved ones safe as well as responding to a call for action. More solidarity is needed on the ground level, maybe with the help of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus that has been pushing for such a coalition on the Hill for years. 
No matter how vastly different each Asian person might feel from each other, it was made abundantly clear how similar we are, or at least we are perceived. In a year of escalating attacks, people of Chinese ethnicity are not the only ones targeted. 
The racist "China virus" rhetoric had nothing to do with South Korea - its government has been among the best in handling the pandemic – and yet four people of Korean descent fell victim to the senseless shooting in Atlanta. 
As the US death toll from the pandemic continued to climb because of Washington's inability to contain the virus under Trump, more Americans bought into the false narrative that Asians were at fault and continued to look for scapegoats to soothe their disgruntled selves. 
The worsening abuses that continue to this day should jolt Asians awake to the reality that to unite is the only way forward. It was, and continues to be, about life or death. Maybe this can be the moment when Asians will come together under the same cause - against the hate crimes targeting the group. 
Asians would then learn to have each other's back regardless of their countries of origin. Then there could be a real chance for an equitable voice that starts with breaking the stereotypical image of Asian timidity.
