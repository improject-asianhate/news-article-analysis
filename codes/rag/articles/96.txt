Phoenix Police DepartmentThe family of a Filipino American man killed in Phoenix after being struck in the face
is a victim of an anti-Asian hate crime, reports People.
Police say 41-year-old Marcus Williams punched 71-year-old Juanito Falcon in the face for “no apparent reason.”
Falcon fell to the ground, suffered head injuries and died two days later in the hospital on February 18.
Authorities arrested Williams March 4.
Speaking out for the first time, the family of Falcon says they are still struggling to make sense of it all.
“It’s my dad who was helpless and who was not able to defend himself. It’s so devastating to think,” said
Falcon’s daughter, Malou Acunin to Fox10 News.
“Being Asian that he is, I believe he was specifically targeted,” said Lysander Lanuza to KCRG TV.
Phoenix Police, however, say the motive remains unclear and that it has no evidence the attack was racially
motivated.
“You took a very special person away from us, and he had so many more years to give and so much more love,”
said Jacklyn Lozada, Falcon’s niece. “We always felt loved by him. we always felt safe, and he always made us
smile.”
