"Anti-Asian violence shows folly of defunding police movement

There’s an old saying about traditions: Abandon a tradition it tells us and you will soon learn why it became one.

That’s what California cities are learning today as city councils around the state have acted on the urging of Black Lives Matter protesters and diverted portions of their former police budgets to social action causes in previously underserved neighborhoods.

But the spate of anti-Asian violence now playing out in California communities as disparate as Sacramento San Jose Los Angeles San Leandro and Orange County dramatically shows this was folly.

The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols but that’s not happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So they continue showing no signs of abating.

Before the coronavirus pandemic this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus plague the “Chinese virus.”

Atlanta shootings: Racism clearly drove Atlanta shootings. It also fuels sexual exploitation of Asian women.

Around California these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year but no one can put a precise number on them. In San Francisco they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles there have been more than twice as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life partly because police don’t do much about the attacks.

Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks like one the other day in San Jose can stop them.

The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such crimes go unreported because of language problems immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus she said “When victims … come forward having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from relying on police.”

Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among police officers perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.

Keith Ellison and Jonathan Greenblatt: Stand together to fight anti-Asian hate. We all have a stake in a more inclusive America.

But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in broad daylight also in San Francisco.

Neither of their assailants has been identified like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.

There are also less violent but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did he shouted “Get out of my country — that’s an order.” After pausing he reportedly added “I’ll kill you.”

All this is a demonstration that even a “model minority” noted for high achievement and founding large and successful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted especially when national leaders become loose-lipped about their own prejudices.

It also shows that not only California but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who have no way to know when they might be victimized even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high public esteem.

Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak this is especially important for elderly and frail individuals.

Yes the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it was deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese individuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.

Because most others have difficulty discerning Asians’ native nationalities simply from their appearance all Asian-Americans are now at serious risk especially if they don’t look strong a la the Los Angeles Angels’ 6-foot 4-inch 210 pound Shohei Otani.

Police are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes. And the fewer cops on the street the more danger for them. Which is just one reason it makes little sense to defund police as Americans are now discovering.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)"" is a reasonably good fit for this article, but it's not a perfect match. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is highly relevant to the article. The piece explicitly mentions the connection between the coronavirus pandemic and the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. The article states, ""But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus plague the 'Chinese virus.'"" This directly links the pandemic to the increase in anti-Asian violence.

2. Specificity: The concept is at an appropriate level of specificity. It captures the broad idea of the pandemic triggering anti-Asian hate, which is a key theme in the article. However, the article goes into more specific details about police defunding and its impact on protecting Asian Americans, which isn't captured by this concept alone.

3. Coverage: While the concept covers an important aspect of the article, it doesn't encompass all of its main points. The article spends significant time discussing the defunding of police and its negative impact on protecting Asian Americans from hate crimes. This aspect isn't directly related to the chosen concept.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects a key point in the article – that the pandemic, particularly when framed as the ""Chinese virus,"" triggered an increase in anti-Asian hate. However, it doesn't capture the article's main argument about the need for police presence to protect Asian Americans.

5. Insight: The concept provides some insight into the root cause of the increased anti-Asian violence discussed in the article. However, it doesn't capture the article's main argument about the importance of police funding and presence in protecting minority communities.

The chosen concept is relevant and accurate for a portion of the article, but it doesn't fully represent the main argument or focus of the piece. The article uses the pandemic-triggered hate as a starting point but then pivots to discuss the importance of police presence and the folly of defunding the police in light of these hate crimes. A concept that better captures the article's main point might be something related to law enforcement's role in protecting minorities from hate crimes.

The chosen concept ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Stereotype B/China/Chinese/Asian virus""/""Kung flu/plague/Ramen noodle flu"" is relevant to the article, but its fit is not as strong or comprehensive as it could be. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is relevant to the article, as it directly mentions the phrase ""Chinese virus"" attributed to Donald Trump. This stereotype is presented as a catalyst for the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes. However, this is not the main focus of the article.

2. Specificity: The chosen concept is quite specific, which is both a strength and a weakness. It accurately pinpoints a key term mentioned in the article, but it may be too narrow to capture the broader themes discussed.

3. Coverage: The concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. While the ""Chinese virus"" phrase is mentioned as a turning point, the article primarily focuses on the consequences of defunding police and its impact on anti-Asian violence.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects the information presented in the article regarding the use of the term ""Chinese virus."" However, it doesn't capture the article's main argument about police defunding and its effects on anti-Asian hate crimes.

5. Insight: The concept provides some insight into one factor contributing to anti-Asian hate, but it doesn't offer much depth in understanding the article's primary message about police presence and protection of minorities.

The article touches on various themes that could be better represented by other concepts from the tree, such as:
- ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Physical attack/violence/Anti-Asian hate crimes""
- ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Law enforcement agency/Local police/Useless law enforcement""
- ""Impacts of Anti-Asian hate on Asian Americans/Behavioral/Not reporting/confronting anti-Asian hate incidents""

These concepts would more comprehensively capture the article's focus on the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, the role of police in preventing such crimes, and the challenges in reporting and addressing these incidents.

While the chosen concept is relevant and accurate for a specific part of the article, it fails to represent the main arguments and broader context presented by the author.

"Anti-Asian violence shows folly of defunding police movement

There’s an old saying about traditions: Abandon a tradition it tells us and you will soon learn why it became one.

That’s what California cities are learning today as city councils around the state have acted on the urging of Black Lives Matter protesters and diverted portions of their former police budgets to social action causes in previously underserved neighborhoods.

But the spate of anti-Asian violence now playing out in California communities as disparate as Sacramento San Jose Los Angeles San Leandro and Orange County dramatically shows this was folly.

The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols but that’s not happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So they continue showing no signs of abating.

Before the coronavirus pandemic this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus plague the “Chinese virus.”

Atlanta shootings: Racism clearly drove Atlanta shootings. It also fuels sexual exploitation of Asian women.

Around California these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year but no one can put a precise number on them. In San Francisco they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles there have been more than twice as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life partly because police don’t do much about the attacks.

Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks like one the other day in San Jose can stop them.

The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such crimes go unreported because of language problems immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus she said “When victims … come forward having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from relying on police.”

Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among police officers perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.

Keith Ellison and Jonathan Greenblatt: Stand together to fight anti-Asian hate. We all have a stake in a more inclusive America.

But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in broad daylight also in San Francisco.

Neither of their assailants has been identified like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.

There are also less violent but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did he shouted “Get out of my country — that’s an order.” After pausing he reportedly added “I’ll kill you.”

All this is a demonstration that even a “model minority” noted for high achievement and founding large and successful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted especially when national leaders become loose-lipped about their own prejudices.

It also shows that not only California but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who have no way to know when they might be victimized even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high public esteem.

Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak this is especially important for elderly and frail individuals.

Yes the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it was deliberately perpetrated on the world.

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Racial discrimination/Physical attack/violence/Anti-Asian hate crimes (investigated by police)"" fits the article relatively well, but there are some limitations to consider:

1. Relevance: The concept is highly relevant to the main theme of the article, which discusses the rise in anti-Asian violence and its relationship to police defunding. The article specifically mentions several instances of physical attacks against Asian Americans, which aligns with the chosen concept.

2. Specificity: The concept is appropriately specific, as it narrows down to physical attacks and violence that are investigated by police as hate crimes. This level of specificity matches the article's focus on violent incidents against Asian Americans and the role of law enforcement in addressing these crimes.

3. Coverage: While the concept covers an important aspect of the article, it doesn't encompass all of the content. The article also discusses broader issues such as police defunding, the impact of political rhetoric on anti-Asian sentiment, and the need for increased police presence. The chosen concept captures the core issue of anti-Asian hate crimes but doesn't reflect these additional themes.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects the information presented in the article regarding physical attacks against Asian Americans. The article mentions specific incidents, such as the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee and an assault on an elderly Asian man in a laundromat, which align with the ""physical attack/violence"" aspect of the concept.

5. Insight: The concept provides a meaningful way to categorize the violent incidents discussed in the article. However, it doesn't capture the article's broader argument about the relationship between these crimes and police defunding, which is a central theme.

The explanation provided focuses on one example (Vicha Ratanapakdee's death) that fits the concept well. However, it could have been strengthened by mentioning other examples from the article, such as the laundromat incident or the overall increase in hate crimes against Asians in various California cities.

It's worth noting that the article doesn't explicitly state whether all the mentioned incidents were officially investigated as hate crimes by police, which is a specific part of the chosen concept. The article does, however, imply that many of these incidents should be treated as such.

Additionally, the concept doesn't capture the article's emphasis on the need for increased police presence and patrols, which is presented as a potential solution to the rise in anti-Asian violence. This aspect is more related to law enforcement responses, which is a different branch of the concept tree.

"Anti-Asian violence shows folly of defunding police movement

Tom Elias

USA Today

2021-03-21

There’s an old saying about traditions: Abandon a tradition it tells us and you will soon learn why it became one.

That’s what California cities are learning today as city councils around the state have acted on the urging of Black Lives Matter protesters and diverted portions of their former police budgets to social action causes in previously underserved neighborhoods.

But the spate of anti-Asian violence now playing out in California communities as disparate as Sacramento San Jose Los Angeles San Leandro and Orange County dramatically shows this was folly.

The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols but that’s not happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So they continue showing no signs of abating.

Before the coronavirus pandemic this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus plague the “Chinese virus.”

Atlanta shootings: Racism clearly drove Atlanta shootings. It also fuels sexual exploitation of Asian women.

Around California these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year but no one can put a precise number on them. In San Francisco they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles there have been more than twice as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life partly because police don’t do much about the attacks.

Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks like one the other day in San Jose can stop them.

The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such crimes go unreported because of language problems immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus she said “When victims … come forward having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from relying on police.”

Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among police officers perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.

Keith Ellison and Jonathan Greenblatt: Stand together to fight anti-Asian hate. We all have a stake in a more inclusive America.

But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in broad daylight also in San Francisco.

Neither of their assailants has been identified like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.

There are also less violent but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did he shouted “Get out of my country — that’s an order.” After pausing he reportedly added “I’ll kill you.”

All this is a demonstration that even a “model minority” noted for high achievement and founding large and successful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted especially when national leaders become loose-lipped about their own prejudices.

It also shows that not only California but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who have no way to know when they might be victimized even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high public esteem.

Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak this is especially important for elderly and frail individuals.

Yes the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it was deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese individuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.

Because most others have difficulty discerning Asians’ native nationalities simply from their appearance all Asian-Americans are now at serious risk especially if they don’t look strong a la the Los Angeles Angels’ 6-foot 4-inch 210 pound Shohei Otani.

The chosen concept ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Law enforcement agency/Local police (e.g., city- and state-level)/Useless law enforcement/Did not take a report on Anti-Asian hate crime"" is relevant to the article, but it only partially captures the complexity of the issues discussed. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is relevant to the article, as it discusses the ineffectiveness of police in addressing anti-Asian hate crimes. However, the article's main focus is on the consequences of defunding the police rather than specifically on police not taking reports.

2. Specificity: The chosen concept is quite specific, which is good. However, it may be too narrow for the broader issues discussed in the article. The article talks about various aspects of police ineffectiveness, not just failing to take reports.

3. Coverage: The concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. While the article does mention that police often don't do much about the attacks, it also discusses other aspects such as the need for more police presence, the impact of defunding, and the broader context of anti-Asian violence.

4. Accuracy: The concept is accurate in that it reflects a point made in the article. The explanation cites a relevant quote: ""When victims … come forward having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from relying on police."" However, this is not the main focus of the article.

5. Insight: The concept provides some insight into one aspect of the problem discussed in the article, but it doesn't capture the article's main argument about the negative consequences of defunding the police.

The article primarily argues that defunding the police has led to increased vulnerability for Asian Americans. It suggests that more police presence could prevent attacks, rather than focusing on police not taking reports. For example, the article states, ""The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols, but that's not happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes.""

A more fitting concept might be something that encompasses the broader theme of police defunding and its impact on minority protection, or the need for effective policing to protect vulnerable communities.

While the chosen concept is not incorrect, it doesn't fully capture the main thrust of the article or its broader implications.

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Communities/Asian/Support Asian Americans"" has some relevance to the article, but it's not a central focus and doesn't fully capture the main themes. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is somewhat relevant, as the article does mention Asian community reactions to hate crimes. However, this is a minor point in the article, which primarily focuses on the increase in anti-Asian violence and the argument against defunding police.

2. Specificity: The chosen concept is reasonably specific, correctly identifying Asian community support for Asian Americans. However, it doesn't capture the nuances of the article's main arguments about policing and violence.

3. Coverage: The concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. The article briefly mentions a 700-person rally in San Jose, which aligns with the chosen concept. However, this is just one sentence in an article that primarily discusses the rise in anti-Asian violence, the impact of defunding police, and the need for increased police presence.

4. Accuracy: The concept is accurate in that it reflects a real element mentioned in the article. However, it doesn't accurately represent the main thrust of the article's argument or its primary focus.

5. Insight: While the concept provides some insight into community responses to anti-Asian hate, it doesn't offer much insight into the article's main arguments about policing and the causes of increased violence.

The explanation provided for choosing this concept is based on a single sentence in the article, which mentions rallies decrying the attacks. While this is indeed present in the article, it's a minor point that doesn't reflect the overall content or main arguments.

A more fitting concept from the tree might be something related to ""Law enforcement agency/Local police"" or ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Law enforcement agency,"" as the article primarily argues for the importance of police presence in preventing anti-Asian hate crimes. The article also touches on concepts related to ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Physical attack/violence,"" as it discusses the increase in violent attacks against Asian Americans.

In summary, while the chosen concept does have some relevance to the article, it fails to capture its main themes and arguments, focusing instead on a minor point mentioned briefly.

"Anti-Asian violence shows folly of defunding police movement

Tom Elias

USA Today

2021-03-21

There’s an old saying about traditions: Abandon a tradition it tells us and you will soon learn why it became one.

That’s what California cities are learning today as city councils around the state have acted on the urging of Black Lives Matter protesters and diverted portions of their former police budgets to social action causes in previously underserved neighborhoods.

But the spate of anti-Asian violence now playing out in California communities as disparate as Sacramento San Jose Los Angeles San Leandro and Orange County dramatically shows this was folly.

The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols but that’s not happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So they continue showing no signs of abating.

Before the coronavirus pandemic this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the coronavirus plague the “Chinese virus.”

Atlanta shootings: Racism clearly drove Atlanta shootings. It also fuels sexual exploitation of Asian women.

Around California these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year but no one can put a precise number on them. In San Francisco they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles there have been more than twice as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life partly because police don’t do much about the attacks.

Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks like one the other day in San Jose can stop them.

The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such crimes go unreported because of language problems immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus she said “When victims … come forward having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from relying on police.”

Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among police officers perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.

Keith Ellison and Jonathan Greenblatt: Stand together to fight anti-Asian hate. We all have a stake in a more inclusive America.

But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in broad daylight also in San Francisco.

Neither of their assailants has been identified like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.

There are also less violent but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did he shouted “Get out of my country — that’s an order.” After pausing he reportedly added “I’ll kill you.”

All this is a demonstration that even a “model minority” noted for high achievement and founding large and successful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted especially when national leaders become loose-lipped about their own prejudices.

It also shows that not only California but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who have no way to know when they might be victimized even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high public esteem.

Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak this is especially important for elderly and frail individuals.

Yes the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it was deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese individuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.

Because most others have difficulty discerning Asians’ native nationalities simply from their appearance all Asian-Americans are now at serious risk especially if they don’t look strong a la the Los Angeles Angels’ 6-foot 4-inch 210 pound Shohei Otani.

Police are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes. And the fewer cops on the street the more danger for them. Which is just one reason it makes little sense to defund police as Americans are now discovering.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

(""Police are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes."")","<evaluation>
<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Impacts of Anti-Asian hate on Asian Americans/Behavioral/Proactive self-defense/protection"" has some relevance to the article, but it's not a strong fit overall. Let's examine this based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is somewhat relevant to the article's theme, as the article discusses the need for protection of Asian Americans from hate crimes. However, the article focuses more on the role of police in providing this protection, rather than on Asian Americans taking proactive measures themselves.

2. Specificity: The chosen concept is quite specific, focusing on behavioral impacts and proactive self-defense. While this level of specificity could be appropriate if the article discussed such measures, it doesn't. The article instead emphasizes the need for increased police presence and patrols.

3. Coverage: The concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. The article primarily discusses the increase in anti-Asian hate crimes, the ineffectiveness of reduced police budgets, and the need for more police presence. It doesn't mention Asian Americans taking proactive self-defense measures.

4. Accuracy: The concept is not particularly accurate in representing the article's content. The article doesn't discuss Asian Americans engaging in proactive self-defense or protection. Instead, it argues that police are the ""only assured protection"" for Asian Americans.

5. Insight: While the concept could provide insight into potential responses to anti-Asian hate, it doesn't align well with the article's main argument, which is about the importance of police presence in preventing hate crimes.

The explanation provided for choosing this concept states that ""The article argues for increased police presence as a means to protect Asian Americans from random acts of violence."" This is accurate, but it actually points to why the chosen concept is not a good fit. The article is indeed about protection, but it's specifically about protection provided by law enforcement, not proactive self-defense by Asian Americans themselves.

A more fitting concept from the tree might be ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Law enforcement agency/Local police (e.g., city- and state-level)"" or even ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Government officers/City/Stop Anti-Asian hate/Support Asian Americans/Increasing patrols"". These concepts would better capture the article's emphasis on the role of police and increased patrols in protecting Asian Americans from hate crimes.

"After Georgia Attacks Asian Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias

Eligon John, Fuller Thomas, Cowan Jill

New York Times

2021-03-18

Police officers mingle with demonstrators at a ‘Stop Asian Hate’ rally in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue Thursday, March 18, 2021. Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the shootings in the Atlanta area have generated anger over the country’s longstanding failure to address anti-Asian discrimination. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)
Video clips of disturbing attacks on the street. Insults hurled by politicians. Derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses.
For most of the last year, Asian Americans have sounded the alarm over the rising discrimination they have experienced and witnessed fueled in part by racist language and false claims about the coronavirus by former President Donald Trump and other public officials. Celebrities, activists, and influencers on social media have implored people to stop the hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Then came the fatal shootings in Georgia of eight people, six of them women of Asian descent.
Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the carnage has evoked another emotion among some Asian Americans: anger over the country’s long-standing failure to take discrimination against them seriously.
Some scholars and activists said Tuesday’s massacre was unsurprising after public officials and popular culture have for years downplayed the dangers of bias and stereotypes against Asians.
Although Asian Americans, like other minority groups, have endured a long history of deadly violence, the threats and discrimination they continue to face are often trivialized as harmless insults. In many cases, some said, people are reluctant to even acknowledge that attacks against Asian Americans could be racially motivated, as happened Wednesday when a law enforcement official in Georgia seemed to dismiss racial animus as a motive in the shootings.
Instead, he said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, was having “a really bad day” and cited Long’s statement that he was driven by a sex addiction and not racial bias.
Even when anti-Asian violence is acknowledged, experts say it is sometimes casually dismissed as an isolated episode rather than a core part of the Asian American story.
“There’s a tendency to not believe that violence against Asian Americans is real,” said Angela Hsu, 52, a lawyer in suburban Atlanta. “It’s almost like you need something really, really jarring to make people believe that there is discrimination against Asian Americans.”
Without a deeper, widespread understanding of, or belief in the dangers that Asian Americans face, it’s difficult for activists to marshal a concerted national push — in law enforcement, the media, and the public — to fight anti-Asian racism, activists say.
They tend to be invisible to much of society, which only furthers a widespread dismissal of anti-Asian violence, said Chris J. Lee, 33, a founder of Plan A Magazine, an online journal focused on Asian American culture and politics.
“The types of people who get killed, like people who work at massage parlors, elderly Asians picking up cans for a living — none of us really know these people,” he said.
The marginalization of Asian Americans has deep roots.
Chinese immigrants who built railways and mined gold in the 19th century were shunted into Chinatowns in San Francisco and other cities, redlined by financial institutions and often left to fend for themselves.
Further immigration from China was restricted by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first immigration law targeting working-class immigrants from a specific country. It was followed in 1917 by the most restrictive immigration law in the nation’s history, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which blocked immigrants from Istanbul all the way to Jakarta and beyond, nearly eliminating all arrivals from some of the most populous areas of the planet — the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
Japanese residents in the United States were for decades kept out of white neighborhoods through covenants written into real estate deeds; tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II.
When immigration laws were liberalized in the 1960s, immigrants from Asia were allowed into the U.S. in unprecedented numbers. 
Asian ethnic groups, though distinct from one another, have at times been lumped together under the umbrella of an Asian American identity. But the anti-Asian violence that has come during the pandemic seems to have solidified a greater sense of solidarity among a group that is diverse in income, religion, and culture, said Will Lex Ham, an actor who has helped lead a campaign of awareness of violence against Asians.
“As long as we share the same physical features, we are being treated the same in this country,” Ham said.
In the wake of attacks on older people in Asian neighborhoods in California, some community leaders have demanded an increased police presence. Others have said that simply adding law enforcement officers was not a solution.
Some are pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint an Asian American to be California’s attorney general.
An Asian American as the state’s top law enforcement official is needed to build trust “particularly when it comes to what have been strained relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities and communities of color,” David Chiu, a member of the California state Assembly, said during a news conference Wednesday.
In the Atlanta area, where the Asian community has grown in recent years and become more politically influential, the murders have reignited anxieties that may have been subsiding for some people as an end to the pandemic is in sight. When the pandemic began, Hsu, the lawyer, said she almost expected that people would hurl insults at her because she is Chinese American. In recent weeks, she had let her guard down, she said.
“We’re coming out of the pandemic, there’s a new president, we’re not hearing ‘Kung Flu’ and ‘China Virus’ every other word,” she said, referring to some of the derogatory terms that Trump used for the coronavirus. “I was really lured into thinking it’s sort of safe to go outside again.” 
Now she is back on high alert.
Suraiya Sharker, a community organizer with the Atlanta chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, said that after the shootings, she received calls from several members of her organization who were in tears.
Sharker, 22, is particularly worried about her parents, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh when she was 4, because they are of the demographic particularly vulnerable to attacks. As first-generation immigrants, their English is not perfect. They work in a fast-food restaurant in suburban Atlanta where Sharker said a customer once threatened her father in a disagreement over the bill and customers have refused to be served by her mother because she wears a hijab.
But as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.
“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)"" is relevant to the article, but its fit is not as strong or comprehensive as it could be given the article's broader focus. Let's evaluate it based on the criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is relevant to the article, as it mentions the coronavirus and its connection to anti-Asian discrimination. However, this is not the primary focus of the article, which deals more broadly with the long-standing issue of anti-Asian racism and the recent surge in violence.

2. Specificity: The concept is specific enough to capture one aspect of the article, but it doesn't encompass the broader historical and societal issues discussed. The article goes beyond just COVID-19-related discrimination to explore systemic racism, historical context, and current activism.

3. Coverage: The chosen concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. While the pandemic is mentioned as a contributing factor, the article spends more time discussing the Atlanta shootings, historical discrimination, and the broader context of anti-Asian racism in America.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects a part of the information presented in the article, particularly the reference to Trump's use of racist language related to the coronavirus. However, it doesn't capture the full scope of the article's discussion on anti-Asian discrimination.

5. Insight: While the concept provides some insight into one trigger for recent anti-Asian sentiment, it doesn't offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the article's main themes of long-standing discrimination, recent violence, and calls for action.

The explanation provided focuses on a single sentence in the article that mentions Trump's coronavirus rhetoric. While this is accurate, it doesn't reflect the article's broader scope, which includes historical context (e.g., the Chinese Exclusion Act, Japanese internment), recent violent incidents (the Atlanta shootings), and the ongoing struggle for recognition of anti-Asian racism as a serious issue.

A more fitting concept might be something broader like ""Types of Anti-Asian hate"" or ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate,"" as these would encompass more of the article's content, including both historical and contemporary issues, as well as community responses and calls for action.

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Stereotype B (with hatred)/China/Chinese/Asian virus""/""Kung flu/plague/Ramen noodle flu"" is relevant to the article, but its fit is limited in several ways:

1. Relevance: The concept is relevant to the article, as it discusses anti-Asian hate and mentions specific derogatory terms used to refer to the coronavirus. However, this is not the main focus of the article, which more broadly covers the rise in discrimination and violence against Asian Americans, particularly in light of the Atlanta shootings.

2. Specificity: The chosen concept is quite specific, focusing on particular derogatory terms used to describe the virus. While this specificity is accurate for the brief mention in the article, it doesn't capture the broader themes of anti-Asian discrimination and violence discussed throughout.

3. Coverage: The concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. The article touches on many aspects of anti-Asian hate, including historical context, recent violent incidents, community responses, and the broader impact on Asian Americans. The specific terms mentioned in the concept are only briefly referenced in one paragraph.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects the information presented in the article regarding the use of derogatory terms by former President Trump. However, it doesn't capture the full scope of anti-Asian sentiment and actions described in the article.

5. Insight: While the concept provides some insight into one aspect of anti-Asian hate (the use of derogatory language), it doesn't offer a comprehensive framework for understanding the article's main themes, such as the long-standing nature of anti-Asian discrimination, the recent surge in violence, and the community's response.

The explanation provided for choosing this concept is accurate but limited. It correctly identifies the mention of ""Kung Flu"" and ""China Virus"" in the article, but it doesn't address how these terms fit into the broader context of the article's discussion on anti-Asian hate and discrimination.

A more fitting concept from the tree might be ""Types of Anti-Asian hate"" or ""Individual-level racism"" as a whole, as these broader categories would encompass more of the article's content, including the violent incidents, stereotypes, and various forms of discrimination discussed.

"After Georgia Attacks Asian Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias

Eligon John, Fuller Thomas, Cowan Jill

New York Times

2021-03-18

Police officers mingle with demonstrators at a ‘Stop Asian Hate’ rally in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue Thursday, March 18, 2021. Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the shootings in the Atlanta area have generated anger over the country’s longstanding failure to address anti-Asian discrimination. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)
Video clips of disturbing attacks on the street. Insults hurled by politicians. Derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses.
For most of the last year, Asian Americans have sounded the alarm over the rising discrimination they have experienced and witnessed fueled in part by racist language and false claims about the coronavirus by former President Donald Trump and other public officials. Celebrities, activists, and influencers on social media have implored people to stop the hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Then came the fatal shootings in Georgia of eight people, six of them women of Asian descent.
Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the carnage has evoked another emotion among some Asian Americans: anger over the country’s long-standing failure to take discrimination against them seriously.
Some scholars and activists said Tuesday’s massacre was unsurprising after public officials and popular culture have for years downplayed the dangers of bias and stereotypes against Asians.
Although Asian Americans, like other minority groups, have endured a long history of deadly violence, the threats and discrimination they continue to face are often trivialized as harmless insults. In many cases, some said, people are reluctant to even acknowledge that attacks against Asian Americans could be racially motivated, as happened Wednesday when a law enforcement official in Georgia seemed to dismiss racial animus as a motive in the shootings.
Instead, he said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, was having “a really bad day” and cited Long’s statement that he was driven by a sex addiction and not racial bias.
Even when anti-Asian violence is acknowledged, experts say it is sometimes casually dismissed as an isolated episode rather than a core part of the Asian American story.
“There’s a tendency to not believe that violence against Asian Americans is real,” said Angela Hsu, 52, a lawyer in suburban Atlanta. “It’s almost like you need something really, really jarring to make people believe that there is discrimination against Asian Americans.”
Without a deeper, widespread understanding of, or belief in the dangers that Asian Americans face, it’s difficult for activists to marshal a concerted national push — in law enforcement, the media, and the public — to fight anti-Asian racism, activists say.
They tend to be invisible to much of society, which only furthers a widespread dismissal of anti-Asian violence, said Chris J. Lee, 33, a founder of Plan A Magazine, an online journal focused on Asian American culture and politics.
“The types of people who get killed, like people who work at massage parlors, elderly Asians picking up cans for a living — none of us really know these people,” he said.
The marginalization of Asian Americans has deep roots.
Chinese immigrants who built railways and mined gold in the 19th century were shunted into Chinatowns in San Francisco and other cities, redlined by financial institutions and often left to fend for themselves.
Further immigration from China was restricted by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first immigration law targeting working-class immigrants from a specific country. It was followed in 1917 by the most restrictive immigration law in the nation’s history, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which blocked immigrants from Istanbul all the way to Jakarta and beyond, nearly eliminating all arrivals from some of the most populous areas of the planet — the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
Japanese residents in the United States were for decades kept out of white neighborhoods through covenants written into real estate deeds; tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II.
When immigration laws were liberalized in the 1960s, immigrants from Asia were allowed into the U.S. in unprecedented numbers. 
Asian ethnic groups, though distinct from one another, have at times been lumped together under the umbrella of an Asian American identity. But the anti-Asian violence that has come during the pandemic seems to have solidified a greater sense of solidarity among a group that is diverse in income, religion, and culture, said Will Lex Ham, an actor who has helped lead a campaign of awareness of violence against Asians.
“As long as we share the same physical features, we are being treated the same in this country,” Ham said.
In the wake of attacks on older people in Asian neighborhoods in California, some community leaders have demanded an increased police presence. Others have said that simply adding law enforcement officers was not a solution.
Some are pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint an Asian American to be California’s attorney general.
An Asian American as the state’s top law enforcement official is needed to build trust “particularly when it comes to what have been strained relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities and communities of color,” David Chiu, a member of the California state Assembly, said during a news conference Wednesday.
In the Atlanta area, where the Asian community has grown in recent years and become more politically influential, the murders have reignited anxieties that may have been subsiding for some people as an end to the pandemic is in sight. When the pandemic began, Hsu, the lawyer, said she almost expected that people would hurl insults at her because she is Chinese American. In recent weeks, she had let her guard down, she said.
“We’re coming out of the pandemic, there’s a new president, we’re not hearing ‘Kung Flu’ and ‘China Virus’ every other word,” she said, referring to some of the derogatory terms that Trump used for the coronavirus. “I was really lured into thinking it’s sort of safe to go outside again.” 
Now she is back on high alert.
Suraiya Sharker, a community organizer with the Atlanta chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, said that after the shootings, she received calls from several members of her organization who were in tears.
Sharker, 22, is particularly worried about her parents, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh when she was 4, because they are of the demographic particularly vulnerable to attacks. As first-generation immigrants, their English is not perfect. They work in a fast-food restaurant in suburban Atlanta where Sharker said a customer once threatened her father in a disagreement over the bill and customers have refused to be served by her mother because she wears a hijab.
But as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.
“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Bigotry/prejudice/Xenophobia"" is a good fit for the article, but it doesn't capture the full scope of the content. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is highly relevant to the main themes of the article. The article focuses on the discrimination and violence faced by Asian Americans, which is a clear manifestation of xenophobia and individual-level racism. The article mentions ""rising discrimination"" and ""racist language,"" which align well with the chosen concept.

2. Specificity: The concept is at an appropriate level of specificity. It correctly identifies the type of racism (individual-level) and the specific form of prejudice (xenophobia) that is prevalent in the situations described in the article. However, it doesn't capture some of the more specific aspects discussed, such as the historical context of discrimination against Asian Americans.

3. Coverage: While the concept covers a significant portion of the article's content, it doesn't encompass everything. The article goes beyond just describing xenophobia; it also discusses systemic issues, historical context, and the community's response to discrimination. For example, the article mentions the Chinese Exclusion Act and the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which are more related to systemic racism than individual-level xenophobia.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects much of the information presented in the article. The examples of discrimination and violence described in the article, such as ""Insults hurled by politicians"" and ""Derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses,"" fit well within the framework of individual-level racism and xenophobia.

5. Insight: The concept provides a meaningful way to understand a significant portion of the article's content. It correctly identifies that the discrimination described is primarily driven by individual-level prejudice and xenophobia. However, it misses some of the broader insights the article offers, such as the historical context of discrimination against Asian Americans and the community's response to recent events.

While the chosen concept is a good fit, it doesn't fully capture the article's discussion of systemic issues, historical context, and community responses. The article goes beyond just describing xenophobia to explore the broader landscape of discrimination against Asian Americans, including both historical and contemporary aspects. The concept also doesn't reflect the article's focus on the Atlanta shootings and the community's reaction to this event, which forms a significant part of the narrative.

But as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.
“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”

The chosen concept ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Racial discrimination/Physical attack/violence/Anti-Asian hate crimes (investigated by police)/Attacked by White or not specified"" fits the article relatively well, but there are some nuances to consider:

1. Relevance: The concept is highly relevant to the main topic of the article, which focuses on the Atlanta shootings and the broader context of anti-Asian hate crimes. The article extensively discusses the attack and its impact on the Asian American community.

2. Specificity: The concept is quite specific, which is both a strength and a limitation. It accurately captures the nature of the Atlanta shootings as an anti-Asian hate crime committed by a white individual. However, this specificity means it doesn't encompass the broader discussions in the article about historical discrimination and other forms of anti-Asian bias.

3. Coverage: While the concept covers a crucial aspect of the article, it doesn't encompass the full range of topics discussed. The article goes beyond just describing the attack to explore historical context, community reactions, and broader issues of discrimination against Asian Americans.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects the information about the Atlanta shootings presented in the article. However, it's worth noting that the article mentions some ambiguity about the motive, with a law enforcement official initially seeming to ""dismiss racial animus as a motive in the shootings.""

5. Insight: The concept provides a meaningful way to categorize the central event discussed in the article. However, it doesn't capture the article's insights into the broader patterns of discrimination and the community's response to the attack.

The explanation provided for choosing this concept is accurate but limited. While it correctly identifies the Atlanta shootings as an example of an anti-Asian hate crime investigated by police with a white perpetrator, it doesn't address the article's broader focus on the historical context of anti-Asian discrimination and the community's response to the attack.

The concept fits well for the specific incident described but doesn't capture the article's wider exploration of anti-Asian sentiment, historical discrimination, and community reactions. The article discusses various forms of discrimination beyond just violent attacks, including ""insults hurled by politicians"" and ""derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses,"" which aren't captured by this specific concept.

"After Georgia Attacks Asian Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias

Eligon John, Fuller Thomas, Cowan Jill

New York Times

2021-03-18

Police officers mingle with demonstrators at a ‘Stop Asian Hate’ rally in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue Thursday, March 18, 2021. Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the shootings in the Atlanta area have generated anger over the country’s longstanding failure to address anti-Asian discrimination. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)
Video clips of disturbing attacks on the street. Insults hurled by politicians. Derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses.
For most of the last year, Asian Americans have sounded the alarm over the rising discrimination they have experienced and witnessed fueled in part by racist language and false claims about the coronavirus by former President Donald Trump and other public officials. Celebrities, activists, and influencers on social media have implored people to stop the hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Then came the fatal shootings in Georgia of eight people, six of them women of Asian descent.
Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the carnage has evoked another emotion among some Asian Americans: anger over the country’s long-standing failure to take discrimination against them seriously.
Some scholars and activists said Tuesday’s massacre was unsurprising after public officials and popular culture have for years downplayed the dangers of bias and stereotypes against Asians.
Although Asian Americans, like other minority groups, have endured a long history of deadly violence, the threats and discrimination they continue to face are often trivialized as harmless insults. In many cases, some said, people are reluctant to even acknowledge that attacks against Asian Americans could be racially motivated, as happened Wednesday when a law enforcement official in Georgia seemed to dismiss racial animus as a motive in the shootings.
Instead, he said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, was having “a really bad day” and cited Long’s statement that he was driven by a sex addiction and not racial bias.
Even when anti-Asian violence is acknowledged, experts say it is sometimes casually dismissed as an isolated episode rather than a core part of the Asian American story.
“There’s a tendency to not believe that violence against Asian Americans is real,” said Angela Hsu, 52, a lawyer in suburban Atlanta. “It’s almost like you need something really, really jarring to make people believe that there is discrimination against Asian Americans.”
Without a deeper, widespread understanding of, or belief in the dangers that Asian Americans face, it’s difficult for activists to marshal a concerted national push — in law enforcement, the media, and the public — to fight anti-Asian racism, activists say.
They tend to be invisible to much of society, which only furthers a widespread dismissal of anti-Asian violence, said Chris J. Lee, 33, a founder of Plan A Magazine, an online journal focused on Asian American culture and politics.
“The types of people who get killed, like people who work at massage parlors, elderly Asians picking up cans for a living — none of us really know these people,” he said.
The marginalization of Asian Americans has deep roots.
Chinese immigrants who built railways and mined gold in the 19th century were shunted into Chinatowns in San Francisco and other cities, redlined by financial institutions and often left to fend for themselves.
Further immigration from China was restricted by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first immigration law targeting working-class immigrants from a specific country. It was followed in 1917 by the most restrictive immigration law in the nation’s history, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which blocked immigrants from Istanbul all the way to Jakarta and beyond, nearly eliminating all arrivals from some of the most populous areas of the planet — the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
Japanese residents in the United States were for decades kept out of white neighborhoods through covenants written into real estate deeds; tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II.
When immigration laws were liberalized in the 1960s, immigrants from Asia were allowed into the U.S. in unprecedented numbers. 
Asian ethnic groups, though distinct from one another, have at times been lumped together under the umbrella of an Asian American identity. But the anti-Asian violence that has come during the pandemic seems to have solidified a greater sense of solidarity among a group that is diverse in income, religion, and culture, said Will Lex Ham, an actor who has helped lead a campaign of awareness of violence against Asians.
“As long as we share the same physical features, we are being treated the same in this country,” Ham said.
In the wake of attacks on older people in Asian neighborhoods in California, some community leaders have demanded an increased police presence. Others have said that simply adding law enforcement officers was not a solution.
Some are pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint an Asian American to be California’s attorney general.
An Asian American as the state’s top law enforcement official is needed to build trust “particularly when it comes to what have been strained relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities and communities of color,” David Chiu, a member of the California state Assembly, said during a news conference Wednesday.
In the Atlanta area, where the Asian community has grown in recent years and become more politically influential, the murders have reignited anxieties that may have been subsiding for some people as an end to the pandemic is in sight. When the pandemic began, Hsu, the lawyer, said she almost expected that people would hurl insults at her because she is Chinese American. In recent weeks, she had let her guard down, she said.
“We’re coming out of the pandemic, there’s a new president, we’re not hearing ‘Kung Flu’ and ‘China Virus’ every other word,” she said, referring to some of the derogatory terms that Trump used for the coronavirus. “I was really lured into thinking it’s sort of safe to go outside again.” 
Now she is back on high alert.
Suraiya Sharker, a community organizer with the Atlanta chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, said that after the shootings, she received calls from several members of her organization who were in tears.
Sharker, 22, is particularly worried about her parents, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh when she was 4, because they are of the demographic particularly vulnerable to attacks. As first-generation immigrants, their English is not perfect. They work in a fast-food restaurant in suburban Atlanta where Sharker said a customer once threatened her father in a disagreement over the bill and customers have refused to be served by her mother because she wears a hijab.
But as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.
“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Racial discrimination/Physical attack/violence/Anti-Asian hate crimes (investigated by police)/sexual violence"" has some relevance to the article, but it doesn't fully capture the main themes and complexities presented. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is relevant to the article, as it discusses the shootings in Atlanta that targeted Asian women. However, the article covers a much broader range of issues related to anti-Asian discrimination and violence.

2. Specificity: The concept is quite specific, focusing on sexual violence as an anti-Asian hate crime. While this aspect is mentioned in the article, it's not the primary focus.

3. Coverage: The chosen concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. The article discusses historical context, various forms of discrimination, community responses, and broader societal issues beyond just the sexual violence aspect of the Atlanta shootings.

4. Accuracy: The concept is not entirely accurate in representing the article's content. While the article mentions the suspect's claim of sex addiction, it also emphasizes that many Asian Americans view the attack as racially motivated, contrary to the official statement that dismissed racial animus.

5. Insight: The concept provides limited insight into the article's main themes. It focuses on one specific aspect (sexual violence) while missing the broader discussion on systemic racism, historical context, and the complexities of Asian American experiences.

The explanation provided with the chosen concept oversimplifies the article's content. While the article does mention the sex addiction claim, it presents this as a controversial statement that many Asian Americans disagree with. The article emphasizes the anger and frustration within the Asian American community over the long-standing dismissal of anti-Asian discrimination.

A more fitting concept might be one that encompasses the broader themes of anti-Asian discrimination, historical context, and the community's response to violence. For example, a concept like ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Macro-level racism/systematic racism/racial injustice/inequity and oppression"" combined with elements from ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate"" would better capture the article's main focus on the systemic nature of anti-Asian discrimination and the community's demand for serious action.

"After Georgia Attacks Asian Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias

Even when anti-Asian violence is acknowledged, experts say it is sometimes casually dismissed as an isolated episode rather than a core part of the Asian American story.
“There’s a tendency to not believe that violence against Asian Americans is real,” said Angela Hsu, 52, a lawyer in suburban Atlanta. “It’s almost like you need something really, really jarring to make people believe that there is discrimination against Asian Americans.”
Without a deeper, widespread understanding of, or belief in the dangers that Asian Americans face, it’s difficult for activists to marshal a concerted national push — in law enforcement, the media, and the public — to fight anti-Asian racism, activists say.
They tend to be invisible to much of society, which only furthers a widespread dismissal of anti-Asian violence, said Chris J. Lee, 33, a founder of Plan A Magazine, an online journal focused on Asian American culture and politics.
“The types of people who get killed, like people who work at massage parlors, elderly Asians picking up cans for a living — none of us really know these people,” he said.
The marginalization of Asian Americans has deep roots.
Chinese immigrants who built railways and mined gold in the 19th century were shunted into Chinatowns in San Francisco and other cities, redlined by financial institutions and often left to fend for themselves.
Further immigration from China was restricted by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first immigration law targeting working-class immigrants from a specific country. It was followed in 1917 by the most restrictive immigration law in the nation’s history, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which blocked immigrants from Istanbul all the way to Jakarta and beyond, nearly eliminating all arrivals from some of the most populous areas of the planet — the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
Japanese residents in the United States were for decades kept out of white neighborhoods through covenants written into real estate deeds; tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II.
When immigration laws were liberalized in the 1960s, immigrants from Asia were allowed into the U.S. in unprecedented numbers. 
Asian ethnic groups, though distinct from one another, have at times been lumped together under the umbrella of an Asian American identity. But the anti-Asian violence that has come during the pandemic seems to have solidified a greater sense of solidarity among a group that is diverse in income, religion, and culture, said Will Lex Ham, an actor who has helped lead a campaign of awareness of violence against Asians.
“As long as we share the same physical features, we are being treated the same in this country,” Ham said.
In the wake of attacks on older people in Asian neighborhoods in California, some community leaders have demanded an increased police presence. Others have said that simply adding law enforcement officers was not a solution.
Some are pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint an Asian American to be California’s attorney general.
An Asian American as the state’s top law enforcement official is needed to build trust “particularly when it comes to what have been strained relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities and communities of color,” David Chiu, a member of the California state Assembly, said during a news conference Wednesday.
In the Atlanta area, where the Asian community has grown in recent years and become more politically influential, the murders have reignited anxieties that may have been subsiding for some people as an end to the pandemic is in sight. When the pandemic began, Hsu, the lawyer, said she almost expected that people would hurl insults at her because she is Chinese American. In recent weeks, she had let her guard down, she said.
“We’re coming out of the pandemic, there’s a new president, we’re not hearing ‘Kung Flu’ and ‘China Virus’ every other word,” she said, referring to some of the derogatory terms that Trump used for the coronavirus. “I was really lured into thinking it’s sort of safe to go outside again.” 
Now she is back on high alert.
Suraiya Sharker, a community organizer with the Atlanta chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, said that after the shootings, she received calls from several members of her organization who were in tears.
Sharker, 22, is particularly worried about her parents, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh when she was 4, because they are of the demographic particularly vulnerable to attacks. As first-generation immigrants, their English is not perfect. They work in a fast-food restaurant in suburban Atlanta where Sharker said a customer once threatened her father in a disagreement over the bill and customers have refused to be served by her mother because she wears a hijab.
But as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.
“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Impacts of Anti-Asian hate on Asian Americans/Psychological/mental health/PTSD/negative emotions"" is a reasonably good fit for the article, but it doesn't fully capture the breadth of the content. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is highly relevant to the article. The piece discusses the psychological impact of anti-Asian hate crimes, particularly in light of the recent shootings in Georgia. The article mentions ""fear, sadness, and pain"" multiple times, which aligns with the ""negative emotions"" part of the chosen concept.

2. Specificity: The concept is appropriately specific, focusing on the psychological impacts of anti-Asian hate. However, it may be slightly too specific in mentioning PTSD, which isn't explicitly discussed in the article. The broader category of ""mental health"" and ""negative emotions"" is more directly applicable.

3. Coverage: While the concept covers an important aspect of the article, it doesn't encompass the full range of topics discussed. The article also covers historical context, current activism, political responses, and the broader societal issue of discrimination against Asian Americans. The psychological impact is just one part of this larger narrative.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects some of the information in the article, particularly the emotional responses of Asian Americans to the recent violence and ongoing discrimination. For example, the article mentions that community members were ""in tears"" and feeling ""fear, sadness, and pain.""

5. Insight: The concept provides a meaningful way to understand one aspect of the article's content, highlighting the personal, emotional toll of anti-Asian hate. However, it doesn't capture the article's broader themes of societal neglect, historical context, and calls for action.

The explanation provided is accurate but limited. It correctly identifies that the shootings and discrimination have caused negative emotions among Asian Americans. However, it doesn't fully capture the anger and frustration expressed in the article about the ""long-standing failure to take discrimination against them seriously.""

While the chosen concept is relevant and accurate for a portion of the article, it misses significant aspects of the piece. The article is more focused on the societal response (or lack thereof) to anti-Asian discrimination and the push for greater recognition and action. The psychological impact, while present, is not the primary focus of the article.

"After Georgia Attacks Asian Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias

Eligon John, Fuller Thomas, Cowan Jill

New York Times

2021-03-18

Police officers mingle with demonstrators at a ‘Stop Asian Hate’ rally in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue Thursday, March 18, 2021. Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the shootings in the Atlanta area have generated anger over the country’s longstanding failure to address anti-Asian discrimination. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)
Video clips of disturbing attacks on the street. Insults hurled by politicians. Derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses.
For most of the last year, Asian Americans have sounded the alarm over the rising discrimination they have experienced and witnessed fueled in part by racist language and false claims about the coronavirus by former President Donald Trump and other public officials. Celebrities, activists, and influencers on social media have implored people to stop the hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Then came the fatal shootings in Georgia of eight people, six of them women of Asian descent.
Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the carnage has evoked another emotion among some Asian Americans: anger over the country’s long-standing failure to take discrimination against them seriously.
Some scholars and activists said Tuesday’s massacre was unsurprising after public officials and popular culture have for years downplayed the dangers of bias and stereotypes against Asians.
Although Asian Americans, like other minority groups, have endured a long history of deadly violence, the threats and discrimination they continue to face are often trivialized as harmless insults. In many cases, some said, people are reluctant to even acknowledge that attacks against Asian Americans could be racially motivated, as happened Wednesday when a law enforcement official in Georgia seemed to dismiss racial animus as a motive in the shootings.
Instead, he said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, was having “a really bad day” and cited Long’s statement that he was driven by a sex addiction and not racial bias.
Even when anti-Asian violence is acknowledged, experts say it is sometimes casually dismissed as an isolated episode rather than a core part of the Asian American story.
“There’s a tendency to not believe that violence against Asian Americans is real,” said Angela Hsu, 52, a lawyer in suburban Atlanta. “It’s almost like you need something really, really jarring to make people believe that there is discrimination against Asian Americans.”

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Communities/Asian/Support Asian Americans"" is relevant to the article, but its fit is not as strong or comprehensive as it could be given the article's content. Let's evaluate it based on the criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is relevant to the article, as it discusses reactions to anti-Asian hate, particularly from Asian American communities. However, the article covers a much broader range of topics and perspectives.

2. Specificity: The concept is somewhat specific, focusing on Asian community support for Asian Americans. While this is mentioned in the article, it's not the primary focus.

3. Coverage: The concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. The article discusses historical context, various forms of discrimination, political responses, and individual experiences, which are not captured by this concept alone.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects some information in the article, such as the mention of the 'Stop Asian Hate' rally. However, it doesn't capture the full scope of reactions and support discussed.

5. Insight: While the concept provides some insight into community responses, it doesn't fully capture the complexity of reactions and the broader societal issues discussed in the article.

The explanation provided mentions the 'Stop Asian Hate' rally, which is indeed relevant. However, this is just one small part of the article's content. The article goes into much greater depth about the historical context of anti-Asian discrimination, the varied responses from different sectors of society (not just Asian communities), and the broader implications of the Atlanta shootings.

The article discusses reactions from law enforcement, politicians, activists, and the general public. It also delves into the long-standing issues of invisibility and marginalization of Asian Americans, which are not captured by the chosen concept.

Furthermore, the article emphasizes the anger and frustration within the Asian American community over the long-standing failure to address discrimination seriously. This aspect is not fully represented by the concept of ""Support Asian Americans,"" which suggests a more positive, unified response.

While the chosen concept is not incorrect, it fails to capture the complexity and breadth of the article's content. A more comprehensive concept or set of concepts would be needed to accurately represent the article's main themes.

"After Georgia Attacks Asian Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias

Eligon John, Fuller Thomas, Cowan Jill

Police officers mingle with demonstrators at a ‘Stop Asian Hate’ rally in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue Thursday, March 18, 2021. Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the shootings in the Atlanta area have generated anger over the country’s longstanding failure to address anti-Asian discrimination. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)
Video clips of disturbing attacks on the street. Insults hurled by politicians. Derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses.
For most of the last year, Asian Americans have sounded the alarm over the rising discrimination they have experienced and witnessed fueled in part by racist language and false claims about the coronavirus by former President Donald Trump and other public officials. Celebrities, activists, and influencers on social media have implored people to stop the hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Then came the fatal shootings in Georgia of eight people, six of them women of Asian descent.
Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the carnage has evoked another emotion among some Asian Americans: anger over the country’s long-standing failure to take discrimination against them seriously.
Some scholars and activists said Tuesday’s massacre was unsurprising after public officials and popular culture have for years downplayed the dangers of bias and stereotypes against Asians.
Although Asian Americans, like other minority groups, have endured a long history of deadly violence, the threats and discrimination they continue to face are often trivialized as harmless insults. In many cases, some said, people are reluctant to even acknowledge that attacks against Asian Americans could be racially motivated, as happened Wednesday when a law enforcement official in Georgia seemed to dismiss racial animus as a motive in the shootings.
Instead, he said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, was having “a really bad day” and cited Long’s statement that he was driven by a sex addiction and not racial bias.
Even when anti-Asian violence is acknowledged, experts say it is sometimes casually dismissed as an isolated episode rather than a core part of the Asian American story.
“There’s a tendency to not believe that violence against Asian Americans is real,” said Angela Hsu, 52, a lawyer in suburban Atlanta. “It’s almost like you need something really, really jarring to make people believe that there is discrimination against Asian Americans.”
Without a deeper, widespread understanding of, or belief in the dangers that Asian Americans face, it’s difficult for activists to marshal a concerted national push — in law enforcement, the media, and the public — to fight anti-Asian racism, activists say.
They tend to be invisible to much of society, which only furthers a widespread dismissal of anti-Asian violence, said Chris J. Lee, 33, a founder of Plan A Magazine, an online journal focused on Asian American culture and politics.
“The types of people who get killed, like people who work at massage parlors, elderly Asians picking up cans for a living — none of us really know these people,” he said.
The marginalization of Asian Americans has deep roots.
Chinese immigrants who built railways and mined gold in the 19th century were shunted into Chinatowns in San Francisco and other cities, redlined by financial institutions and often left to fend for themselves.
Further immigration from China was restricted by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first immigration law targeting working-class immigrants from a specific country. It was followed in 1917 by the most restrictive immigration law in the nation’s history, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which blocked immigrants from Istanbul all the way to Jakarta and beyond, nearly eliminating all arrivals from some of the most populous areas of the planet — the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
Japanese residents in the United States were for decades kept out of white neighborhoods through covenants written into real estate deeds; tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II.
When immigration laws were liberalized in the 1960s, immigrants from Asia were allowed into the U.S. in unprecedented numbers. 
Asian ethnic groups, though distinct from one another, have at times been lumped together under the umbrella of an Asian American identity. But the anti-Asian violence that has come during the pandemic seems to have solidified a greater sense of solidarity among a group that is diverse in income, religion, and culture, said Will Lex Ham, an actor who has helped lead a campaign of awareness of violence against Asians.
“As long as we share the same physical features, we are being treated the same in this country,” Ham said.
In the wake of attacks on older people in Asian neighborhoods in California, some community leaders have demanded an increased police presence. Others have said that simply adding law enforcement officers was not a solution.
Some are pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint an Asian American to be California’s attorney general.
An Asian American as the state’s top law enforcement official is needed to build trust “particularly when it comes to what have been strained relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities and communities of color,” David Chiu, a member of the California state Assembly, said during a news conference Wednesday.
In the Atlanta area, where the Asian community has grown in recent years and become more politically influential, the murders have reignited anxieties that may have been subsiding for some people as an end to the pandemic is in sight. When the pandemic began, Hsu, the lawyer, said she almost expected that people would hurl insults at her because she is Chinese American. In recent weeks, she had let her guard down, she said.
“We’re coming out of the pandemic, there’s a new president, we’re not hearing ‘Kung Flu’ and ‘China Virus’ every other word,” she said, referring to some of the derogatory terms that Trump used for the coronavirus. “I was really lured into thinking it’s sort of safe to go outside again.” 
Now she is back on high alert.
Suraiya Sharker, a community organizer with the Atlanta chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, said that after the shootings, she received calls from several members of her organization who were in tears.
Sharker, 22, is particularly worried about her parents, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh when she was 4, because they are of the demographic particularly vulnerable to attacks. As first-generation immigrants, their English is not perfect. They work in a fast-food restaurant in suburban Atlanta where Sharker said a customer once threatened her father in a disagreement over the bill and customers have refused to be served by her mother because she wears a hijab.
But as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.
“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Individuals/celebrities (e.g., athletes and actors)/Asian/Support Asian Americans/speaking up on social media"" has some relevance to the article, but its fit is limited in several ways:

1. Relevance: The concept is related to one of the themes in the article, which is the response to anti-Asian hate. However, this is not a central focus of the article, which primarily discusses the broader context of discrimination against Asian Americans and the recent shootings in Georgia.

2. Specificity: The concept is quite specific, focusing on Asian celebrities speaking up on social media. While this level of specificity can be useful in some contexts, it's too narrow for the broad scope of this article, which covers various aspects of anti-Asian discrimination and violence.

3. Coverage: The chosen concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. The article mentions celebrities and social media influencers briefly in one sentence: ""Celebrities, activists, and influencers on social media have implored people to stop the hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders."" However, this is not a major focus of the piece.

4. Accuracy: The concept is accurate in that it reflects information presented in the article. However, the article does not specify that the celebrities mentioned are Asian, which the chosen concept assumes.

5. Insight: While the concept provides some insight into one aspect of the response to anti-Asian hate, it doesn't capture the more significant themes of the article, such as the historical context of discrimination against Asian Americans, the impact of recent violence, and the broader societal response to these issues.

The explanation provided for choosing this concept is accurate but very limited in scope. It correctly identifies the mention of celebrities and social media in the article but doesn't address why this particular aspect was chosen over other, more prominent themes in the piece.

A more fitting concept from the tree might have been something broader, such as ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate"" or ""Types of Anti-Asian hate/Individual-level racism/Physical attack/violence,"" as these would encompass more of the article's content and central themes.

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Individuals/Professionals (e.g., university professors)/Asian/Support Asian Americans/Fostering conversations about anti-Asian hate"" has some relevance to the article, but it's not a perfect fit. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is relevant to the article's overall theme of addressing anti-Asian hate and discrimination. However, the article doesn't specifically focus on professionals or university professors fostering conversations about anti-Asian hate.

2. Specificity: The chosen concept is quite specific, which doesn't align well with the broader scope of the article. The article mentions scholars and activists in a general sense but doesn't delve into the specific actions of Asian professionals fostering conversations.

3. Coverage: This concept covers only a small portion of the article's content. The article is much broader, discussing various aspects of anti-Asian discrimination, historical context, and reactions from different groups and individuals.

4. Accuracy: While the concept is not inaccurate, it doesn't precisely reflect the information presented in the article. The article does mention ""Some scholars and activists said Tuesday's massacre was unsurprising,"" but it doesn't explicitly discuss Asian professionals fostering conversations about anti-Asian hate.

5. Insight: The concept provides some insight into one possible reaction to anti-Asian hate, but it doesn't capture the full range of reactions and issues discussed in the article.

The explanation provided (""The article references experts and activists speaking out about the need to address anti-Asian discrimination more seriously"") is somewhat accurate but overly simplistic. It doesn't justify the specific choice of Asian professionals fostering conversations, as the article doesn't make this distinction.

A more fitting concept from the tree might be ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate/Individuals/General public/Asians/Commenting on reasons behind anti-Asian racism"" or a broader category like ""Reactions toward Anti-Asian Hate"" that encompasses various individual and group responses mentioned in the article.

The article covers a wide range of topics, including historical context of anti-Asian discrimination, recent violent incidents, political influences, and various community responses. It doesn't focus specifically on Asian professionals fostering conversations, making the chosen concept too narrow for the article's scope.

"After Georgia Attacks Asian Americans Demand Serious Action on Bias

Eligon John, Fuller Thomas, Cowan Jill

New York Times

2021-03-18

Police officers mingle with demonstrators at a ‘Stop Asian Hate’ rally in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue Thursday, March 18, 2021. Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the shootings in the Atlanta area have generated anger over the country’s longstanding failure to address anti-Asian discrimination. (Ruth Fremson/The New York Times)
Video clips of disturbing attacks on the street. Insults hurled by politicians. Derogatory graffiti scrawled on businesses.
For most of the last year, Asian Americans have sounded the alarm over the rising discrimination they have experienced and witnessed fueled in part by racist language and false claims about the coronavirus by former President Donald Trump and other public officials. Celebrities, activists, and influencers on social media have implored people to stop the hate against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Then came the fatal shootings in Georgia of eight people, six of them women of Asian descent.
Amid fear, sadness, and pain, the carnage has evoked another emotion among some Asian Americans: anger over the country’s long-standing failure to take discrimination against them seriously.
Some scholars and activists said Tuesday’s massacre was unsurprising after public officials and popular culture have for years downplayed the dangers of bias and stereotypes against Asians.
Although Asian Americans, like other minority groups, have endured a long history of deadly violence, the threats and discrimination they continue to face are often trivialized as harmless insults. In many cases, some said, people are reluctant to even acknowledge that attacks against Asian Americans could be racially motivated, as happened Wednesday when a law enforcement official in Georgia seemed to dismiss racial animus as a motive in the shootings.
Instead, he said the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, who is white, was having “a really bad day” and cited Long’s statement that he was driven by a sex addiction and not racial bias.
Even when anti-Asian violence is acknowledged, experts say it is sometimes casually dismissed as an isolated episode rather than a core part of the Asian American story.
“There’s a tendency to not believe that violence against Asian Americans is real,” said Angela Hsu, 52, a lawyer in suburban Atlanta. “It’s almost like you need something really, really jarring to make people believe that there is discrimination against Asian Americans.”
Without a deeper, widespread understanding of, or belief in the dangers that Asian Americans face, it’s difficult for activists to marshal a concerted national push — in law enforcement, the media, and the public — to fight anti-Asian racism, activists say.
They tend to be invisible to much of society, which only furthers a widespread dismissal of anti-Asian violence, said Chris J. Lee, 33, a founder of Plan A Magazine, an online journal focused on Asian American culture and politics.
“The types of people who get killed, like people who work at massage parlors, elderly Asians picking up cans for a living — none of us really know these people,” he said.
The marginalization of Asian Americans has deep roots.
Chinese immigrants who built railways and mined gold in the 19th century were shunted into Chinatowns in San Francisco and other cities, redlined by financial institutions and often left to fend for themselves.
Further immigration from China was restricted by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the first immigration law targeting working-class immigrants from a specific country. It was followed in 1917 by the most restrictive immigration law in the nation’s history, the Asiatic Barred Zone Act, which blocked immigrants from Istanbul all the way to Jakarta and beyond, nearly eliminating all arrivals from some of the most populous areas of the planet — the South Asian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
Japanese residents in the United States were for decades kept out of white neighborhoods through covenants written into real estate deeds; tens of thousands of American citizens of Japanese descent were incarcerated in internment camps during World War II.
When immigration laws were liberalized in the 1960s, immigrants from Asia were allowed into the U.S. in unprecedented numbers. 
Asian ethnic groups, though distinct from one another, have at times been lumped together under the umbrella of an Asian American identity. But the anti-Asian violence that has come during the pandemic seems to have solidified a greater sense of solidarity among a group that is diverse in income, religion, and culture, said Will Lex Ham, an actor who has helped lead a campaign of awareness of violence against Asians.
“As long as we share the same physical features, we are being treated the same in this country,” Ham said.
In the wake of attacks on older people in Asian neighborhoods in California, some community leaders have demanded an increased police presence. Others have said that simply adding law enforcement officers was not a solution.
Some are pushing Gov. Gavin Newsom to appoint an Asian American to be California’s attorney general.
An Asian American as the state’s top law enforcement official is needed to build trust “particularly when it comes to what have been strained relationships between law enforcement and immigrant communities and communities of color,” David Chiu, a member of the California state Assembly, said during a news conference Wednesday.
In the Atlanta area, where the Asian community has grown in recent years and become more politically influential, the murders have reignited anxieties that may have been subsiding for some people as an end to the pandemic is in sight. When the pandemic began, Hsu, the lawyer, said she almost expected that people would hurl insults at her because she is Chinese American. In recent weeks, she had let her guard down, she said.
“We’re coming out of the pandemic, there’s a new president, we’re not hearing ‘Kung Flu’ and ‘China Virus’ every other word,” she said, referring to some of the derogatory terms that Trump used for the coronavirus. “I was really lured into thinking it’s sort of safe to go outside again.” 
Now she is back on high alert.
Suraiya Sharker, a community organizer with the Atlanta chapter of the National Asian Pacific American Women’s Forum, said that after the shootings, she received calls from several members of her organization who were in tears.
Sharker, 22, is particularly worried about her parents, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh when she was 4, because they are of the demographic particularly vulnerable to attacks. As first-generation immigrants, their English is not perfect. They work in a fast-food restaurant in suburban Atlanta where Sharker said a customer once threatened her father in a disagreement over the bill and customers have refused to be served by her mother because she wears a hijab.
But as much as she and other Asian Americans are more cautious now, they are also more energized, she said.
“This,” she said, “has been an awakening for a lot of folks to say ‘Enough is enough.’”

1. Relevance: The concept is related to one of the themes in the article, which discusses reactions to anti-Asian hate crimes. However, it's not a central focus of the piece, which primarily deals with the broader issue of discrimination against Asian Americans and the recent shootings in Georgia.

4. Accuracy: The concept is accurate in that it reflects a reaction mentioned in the article. However, the article presents this as a demand from community leaders rather than an action already taken by city government officers, which the concept implies.

5. Insight: The concept provides limited insight into the article's main themes. While increased patrols are one potential response to anti-Asian hate, the article focuses more on the broader historical context of discrimination against Asian Americans, the impact of recent events, and the need for more comprehensive action.

The article covers a much broader range of topics, including the historical context of discrimination against Asian Americans, the impact of recent attacks, the dismissal of anti-Asian racism by some officials, and various community responses. It also discusses the need for more comprehensive action beyond just increased policing, such as appointing Asian Americans to high-level government positions and addressing systemic racism.

"Asian Americans Are Being Attacked. Why Are Hate Crime Charges So Rare?

Nicole Hong, Jonah E. Bromwich

New York Times

2021-03-18

NEW YORK — On a cold evening last month, a Chinese man was walking home near Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood when a stranger suddenly ran up behind him and plunged a knife into his back.

For many Asian Americans, the stabbing was horrifying but not surprising. It was widely seen as just the latest example of racially targeted violence against Asians during the pandemic.

But the perpetrator, a 23-year-old man from Yemen, had not said a word to the victim before the attack, investigators said. Prosecutors determined they lacked enough evidence to prove a racist motive. The attacker was charged with attempted murder but not as a hate crime.

The announcement outraged Asian American leaders in New York City. Many of them protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by authorities.

“Let’s call it what it is,” said Don Lee, a community activist who spoke at the rally. “These are not random attacks. We’re asking for recognition that these crimes are happening.”

The rally reflected the public conversation over how to confront a rise in reports of violence against Asian Americans, who have felt increasingly vulnerable with each new attack. Many incidents have either not led to arrests or have not been charged as hate crimes, making it difficult to capture with reliable data the extent to which Asian Americans are being targeted.

That frustration erupted on a national scale this week after Robert Aaron Long, a white man, was charged with fatally shooting eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday night.

Investigators said it was too early to determine a motive. After Long’s arrest, he denied harboring a racial bias and told officials that he carried out the shootings as a form of vengeance for his “sexual addiction.”

The Atlanta shootings and other recent attacks have exposed difficult questions involved in proving a racist motive. Did the assaults just happen to involve Asian victims? Or did the attackers purposely single out Asians in an unspoken way that can never be presented as evidence in court?

Many Asian Americans have been left wondering how much cultural stereotypes that cast them — especially women — as weak or submissive targets played a role.

Other incidents that clearly seemed racially motivated have not resulted in arrests. Police are still searching for a man who called an Asian American mother the “Chinese virus” and spat at her child in Queens last week.

As the debate over what legally qualifies as anti-Asian bias unfolds, the community is grappling with the reality that the law is simply not designed to account for many of the ways in which Asian Americans experience racism.

In New York state, to charge such attacks as hate crimes, prosecutors would need to show that the victims were targeted because of their race.

But proving a racist motive can be particularly difficult with attacks against Asians, experts say. There is no widely recognized symbol of anti-Asian hate comparable to a noose or a swastika. Historically, many Asian crime victims around the country were small-business owners who were robbed, complicating the question of motive.

“There’s a recognizable prototype with anti-Black or anti-Semitic or anti-gay hate crime,” said Lu-in Wang, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. “They’re often more clear-cut.”

Asian Americans are sharply divided over the best measures to curb the violence, reflecting the wide ideological and generational differences within a group that encompasses dozens of ethnicities. There are about 1.2 million Asians in New York City, according to census data, making up 14% of the city’s population.

Some have called for lowering the bar to bring hate crime charges, toughening penalties and boosting funding for the New York Police Department to investigate attacks against Asians.

Others have opposed these proposals, saying more policing could harm their own communities, worsen racial tensions and disproportionately target the Black and Latino communities that have long dealt with aggressive policing.

“I’ve rarely seen people who are more socially privileged be the ones accused of hate crimes,” said Anne Oredeko, the supervising attorney with the racial justice unit at Legal Aid, a public defenders group.

Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a social services agency, said many of his Asian colleagues were verbally harassed during the pandemic but chose not to alert law enforcement because they worried the perpetrators, who were often people of color, could be mistreated by police.

“I asked myself, do I want this person in jail?” said Alice Wong, one of Ho’s colleagues. “Just because you put someone in jail doesn’t make them not hate anyone anymore.”

Recognizing this challenge, some law enforcement officials have called for people who commit hate crimes to attend anti-racism classes as an alternative to prison.

The approach was used after four teenage girls last March assaulted a 52-year-old Asian woman on a bus in the Bronx while accusing her of spreading the coronavirus, according to prosecutors. One of the girls beat her with an umbrella.

With the consent of the victim, prosecutors allowed three of the girls to be cleared of criminal charges if they participated in an educational program on hate crimes for two months. Their identities have not been made public because they are minors.

Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights lawyer who supervised the program, said the program helped debunk stereotypes for the girls, who are Black and grew up without much interaction with Asian Americans. By the end, OuYang felt confident that they were remorseful about what they had done.

“The girls are good kids,” OuYang said. “They’re not evil monsters. I swear on my mother’s grave they will not commit another hate crime again.”","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

<reasoning>
The chosen concept ""COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)"" is a reasonably good fit for the article, but it has some limitations in fully capturing the article's main focus. Let's evaluate it based on the given criteria:

1. Relevance: The concept is relevant to the article, as the pandemic is mentioned as a context for the increase in anti-Asian violence. The article states, ""Many of them protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney's Office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by authorities."" This implies that the pandemic has contributed to a rise in such incidents.

2. Specificity: The concept is somewhat specific, as it identifies the pandemic as a trigger for anti-Asian hate. However, it doesn't capture the article's primary focus on the challenges of prosecuting these incidents as hate crimes, which is a more specific aspect of the issue.

3. Coverage: While the pandemic is mentioned as a context, it doesn't cover the majority of the article's content. The article primarily discusses the difficulties in proving racist motives, the debate over hate crime charges, and the community's response to these challenges. The pandemic is more of a background factor rather than the main subject.

4. Accuracy: The concept accurately reflects that the pandemic has triggered anti-Asian hate, which is consistent with the article's content. However, it doesn't capture the nuanced discussion about law enforcement, community responses, and the complexities of proving hate crimes.

5. Insight: The concept provides some insight into the root cause of the increased violence, but it doesn't offer much depth into the legal and social challenges discussed in the article. A concept that focuses more on the difficulties of prosecuting hate crimes or the community's response to violence would provide more meaningful insight into the article's main themes.

While the chosen concept is relevant and accurate to some extent, it fails to capture the article's primary focus on the challenges of prosecuting anti-Asian violence as hate crimes and the community's response to these issues. The pandemic is mentioned more as a contextual factor rather than the central theme of the discussion.

"Asian Americans Are Being Attacked. Why Are Hate Crime Charges So Rare?

Nicole Hong, Jonah E. Bromwich

New York Times

2021-03-18

NEW YORK — On a cold evening last month, a Chinese man was walking home near Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood when a stranger suddenly ran up behind him and plunged a knife into his back.

For many Asian Americans, the stabbing was horrifying but not surprising. It was widely seen as just the latest example of racially targeted violence against Asians during the pandemic.

But the perpetrator, a 23-year-old man from Yemen, had not said a word to the victim before the attack, investigators said. Prosecutors determined they lacked enough evidence to prove a racist motive. The attacker was charged with attempted murder but not as a hate crime.

The announcement outraged Asian American leaders in New York City. Many of them protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by authorities.

“Let’s call it what it is,” said Don Lee, a community activist who spoke at the rally. “These are not random attacks. We’re asking for recognition that these crimes are happening.”

The rally reflected the public conversation over how to confront a rise in reports of violence against Asian Americans, who have felt increasingly vulnerable with each new attack. Many incidents have either not led to arrests or have not been charged as hate crimes, making it difficult to capture with reliable data the extent to which Asian Americans are being targeted.

That frustration erupted on a national scale this week after Robert Aaron Long, a white man, was charged with fatally shooting eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday night.

Investigators said it was too early to determine a motive. After Long’s arrest, he denied harboring a racial bias and told officials that he carried out the shootings as a form of vengeance for his “sexual addiction.”

The Atlanta shootings and other recent attacks have exposed difficult questions involved in proving a racist motive. Did the assaults just happen to involve Asian victims? Or did the attackers purposely single out Asians in an unspoken way that can never be presented as evidence in court?

Many Asian Americans have been left wondering how much cultural stereotypes that cast them — especially women — as weak or submissive targets played a role.

Other incidents that clearly seemed racially motivated have not resulted in arrests. Police are still searching for a man who called an Asian American mother the “Chinese virus” and spat at her child in Queens last week.

As the debate over what legally qualifies as anti-Asian bias unfolds, the community is grappling with the reality that the law is simply not designed to account for many of the ways in which Asian Americans experience racism.

In New York state, to charge such attacks as hate crimes, prosecutors would need to show that the victims were targeted because of their race.

But proving a racist motive can be particularly difficult with attacks against Asians, experts say. There is no widely recognized symbol of anti-Asian hate comparable to a noose or a swastika. Historically, many Asian crime victims around the country were small-business owners who were robbed, complicating the question of motive.

“There’s a recognizable prototype with anti-Black or anti-Semitic or anti-gay hate crime,” said Lu-in Wang, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. “They’re often more clear-cut.”

Asian Americans are sharply divided over the best measures to curb the violence, reflecting the wide ideological and generational differences within a group that encompasses dozens of ethnicities. There are about 1.2 million Asians in New York City, according to census data, making up 14% of the city’s population.

Some have called for lowering the bar to bring hate crime charges, toughening penalties and boosting funding for the New York Police Department to investigate attacks against Asians.

Others have opposed these proposals, saying more policing could harm their own communities, worsen racial tensions and disproportionately target the Black and Latino communities that have long dealt with aggressive policing.

“I’ve rarely seen people who are more socially privileged be the ones accused of hate crimes,” said Anne Oredeko, the supervising attorney with the racial justice unit at Legal Aid, a public defenders group.

Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a social services agency, said many of his Asian colleagues were verbally harassed during the pandemic but chose not to alert law enforcement because they worried the perpetrators, who were often people of color, could be mistreated by police.

“I asked myself, do I want this person in jail?” said Alice Wong, one of Ho’s colleagues. “Just because you put someone in jail doesn’t make them not hate anyone anymore.”

Recognizing this challenge, some law enforcement officials have called for people who commit hate crimes to attend anti-racism classes as an alternative to prison.

The approach was used after four teenage girls last March assaulted a 52-year-old Asian woman on a bus in the Bronx while accusing her of spreading the coronavirus, according to prosecutors. One of the girls beat her with an umbrella.

With the consent of the victim, prosecutors allowed three of the girls to be cleared of criminal charges if they participated in an educational program on hate crimes for two months. Their identities have not been made public because they are minors.

Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights lawyer who supervised the program, said the program helped debunk stereotypes for the girls, who are Black and grew up without much interaction with Asian Americans. By the end, OuYang felt confident that they were remorseful about what they had done.

“The girls are good kids,” OuYang said. “They’re not evil monsters. I swear on my mother’s grave they will not commit another hate crime again.”","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

"Asian Americans Are Being Attacked. Why Are Hate Crime Charges So Rare?

2021-03-18

NEW YORK — On a cold evening last month, a Chinese man was walking home near Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood when a stranger suddenly ran up behind him and plunged a knife into his back.

For many Asian Americans, the stabbing was horrifying but not surprising. It was widely seen as just the latest example of racially targeted violence against Asians during the pandemic.

But the perpetrator, a 23-year-old man from Yemen, had not said a word to the victim before the attack, investigators said. Prosecutors determined they lacked enough evidence to prove a racist motive. The attacker was charged with attempted murder but not as a hate crime.

The announcement outraged Asian American leaders in New York City. Many of them protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by authorities.

“Let’s call it what it is,” said Don Lee, a community activist who spoke at the rally. “These are not random attacks. We’re asking for recognition that these crimes are happening.”

The rally reflected the public conversation over how to confront a rise in reports of violence against Asian Americans, who have felt increasingly vulnerable with each new attack. Many incidents have either not led to arrests or have not been charged as hate crimes, making it difficult to capture with reliable data the extent to which Asian Americans are being targeted.

That frustration erupted on a national scale this week after Robert Aaron Long, a white man, was charged with fatally shooting eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday night.

Investigators said it was too early to determine a motive. After Long’s arrest, he denied harboring a racial bias and told officials that he carried out the shootings as a form of vengeance for his “sexual addiction.”

The Atlanta shootings and other recent attacks have exposed difficult questions involved in proving a racist motive. Did the assaults just happen to involve Asian victims? Or did the attackers purposely single out Asians in an unspoken way that can never be presented as evidence in court?

Many Asian Americans have been left wondering how much cultural stereotypes that cast them — especially women — as weak or submissive targets played a role.

Other incidents that clearly seemed racially motivated have not resulted in arrests. Police are still searching for a man who called an Asian American mother the “Chinese virus” and spat at her child in Queens last week.

As the debate over what legally qualifies as anti-Asian bias unfolds, the community is grappling with the reality that the law is simply not designed to account for many of the ways in which Asian Americans experience racism.

In New York state, to charge such attacks as hate crimes, prosecutors would need to show that the victims were targeted because of their race.

But proving a racist motive can be particularly difficult with attacks against Asians, experts say. There is no widely recognized symbol of anti-Asian hate comparable to a noose or a swastika. Historically, many Asian crime victims around the country were small-business owners who were robbed, complicating the question of motive.

“There’s a recognizable prototype with anti-Black or anti-Semitic or anti-gay hate crime,” said Lu-in Wang, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. “They’re often more clear-cut.”

Asian Americans are sharply divided over the best measures to curb the violence, reflecting the wide ideological and generational differences within a group that encompasses dozens of ethnicities. There are about 1.2 million Asians in New York City, according to census data, making up 14% of the city’s population.

Some have called for lowering the bar to bring hate crime charges, toughening penalties and boosting funding for the New York Police Department to investigate attacks against Asians.

Others have opposed these proposals, saying more policing could harm their own communities, worsen racial tensions and disproportionately target the Black and Latino communities that have long dealt with aggressive policing.

“I’ve rarely seen people who are more socially privileged be the ones accused of hate crimes,” said Anne Oredeko, the supervising attorney with the racial justice unit at Legal Aid, a public defenders group.

Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a social services agency, said many of his Asian colleagues were verbally harassed during the pandemic but chose not to alert law enforcement because they worried the perpetrators, who were often people of color, could be mistreated by police.

“I asked myself, do I want this person in jail?” said Alice Wong, one of Ho’s colleagues. “Just because you put someone in jail doesn’t make them not hate anyone anymore.”

Recognizing this challenge, some law enforcement officials have called for people who commit hate crimes to attend anti-racism classes as an alternative to prison.

The approach was used after four teenage girls last March assaulted a 52-year-old Asian woman on a bus in the Bronx while accusing her of spreading the coronavirus, according to prosecutors. One of the girls beat her with an umbrella.

With the consent of the victim, prosecutors allowed three of the girls to be cleared of criminal charges if they participated in an educational program on hate crimes for two months. Their identities have not been made public because they are minors.

Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights lawyer who supervised the program, said the program helped debunk stereotypes for the girls, who are Black and grew up without much interaction with Asian Americans. By the end, OuYang felt confident that they were remorseful about what they had done.

“The girls are good kids,” OuYang said. “They’re not evil monsters. I swear on my mother’s grave they will not commit another hate crime again.”","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

“I asked myself, do I want this person in jail?” said Alice Wong, one of Ho’s colleagues. “Just because you put someone in jail doesn’t make them not hate anyone anymore.”

Recognizing this challenge, some law enforcement officials have called for people who commit hate crimes to attend anti-racism classes as an alternative to prison.

The approach was used after four teenage girls last March assaulted a 52-year-old Asian woman on a bus in the Bronx while accusing her of spreading the coronavirus, according to prosecutors. One of the girls beat her with an umbrella.

With the consent of the victim, prosecutors allowed three of the girls to be cleared of criminal charges if they participated in an educational program on hate crimes for two months. Their identities have not been made public because they are minors.

Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights lawyer who supervised the program, said the program helped debunk stereotypes for the girls, who are Black and grew up without much interaction with Asian Americans. By the end, OuYang felt confident that they were remorseful about what they had done.

“The girls are good kids,” OuYang said. “They’re not evil monsters. I swear on my mother’s grave they will not commit another hate crime again.”","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

"Asian Americans Are Being Attacked. Why Are Hate Crime Charges So Rare?

Nicole Hong, Jonah E. Bromwich

New York Times

2021-03-18

NEW YORK — On a cold evening last month, a Chinese man was walking home near Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood when a stranger suddenly ran up behind him and plunged a knife into his back.

For many Asian Americans, the stabbing was horrifying but not surprising. It was widely seen as just the latest example of racially targeted violence against Asians during the pandemic.

But the perpetrator, a 23-year-old man from Yemen, had not said a word to the victim before the attack, investigators said. Prosecutors determined they lacked enough evidence to prove a racist motive. The attacker was charged with attempted murder but not as a hate crime.

The announcement outraged Asian American leaders in New York City. Many of them protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by authorities.

“Let’s call it what it is,” said Don Lee, a community activist who spoke at the rally. “These are not random attacks. We’re asking for recognition that these crimes are happening.”

The rally reflected the public conversation over how to confront a rise in reports of violence against Asian Americans, who have felt increasingly vulnerable with each new attack. Many incidents have either not led to arrests or have not been charged as hate crimes, making it difficult to capture with reliable data the extent to which Asian Americans are being targeted.

That frustration erupted on a national scale this week after Robert Aaron Long, a white man, was charged with fatally shooting eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday night.

Investigators said it was too early to determine a motive. After Long’s arrest, he denied harboring a racial bias and told officials that he carried out the shootings as a form of vengeance for his “sexual addiction.”

The Atlanta shootings and other recent attacks have exposed difficult questions involved in proving a racist motive. Did the assaults just happen to involve Asian victims? Or did the attackers purposely single out Asians in an unspoken way that can never be presented as evidence in court?

Many Asian Americans have been left wondering how much cultural stereotypes that cast them — especially women — as weak or submissive targets played a role.

Other incidents that clearly seemed racially motivated have not resulted in arrests. Police are still searching for a man who called an Asian American mother the “Chinese virus” and spat at her child in Queens last week.

As the debate over what legally qualifies as anti-Asian bias unfolds, the community is grappling with the reality that the law is simply not designed to account for many of the ways in which Asian Americans experience racism.

In New York state, to charge such attacks as hate crimes, prosecutors would need to show that the victims were targeted because of their race.

But proving a racist motive can be particularly difficult with attacks against Asians, experts say. There is no widely recognized symbol of anti-Asian hate comparable to a noose or a swastika. Historically, many Asian crime victims around the country were small-business owners who were robbed, complicating the question of motive.

“There’s a recognizable prototype with anti-Black or anti-Semitic or anti-gay hate crime,” said Lu-in Wang, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. “They’re often more clear-cut.”

Asian Americans are sharply divided over the best measures to curb the violence, reflecting the wide ideological and generational differences within a group that encompasses dozens of ethnicities. There are about 1.2 million Asians in New York City, according to census data, making up 14% of the city’s population.

Some have called for lowering the bar to bring hate crime charges, toughening penalties and boosting funding for the New York Police Department to investigate attacks against Asians.

Others have opposed these proposals, saying more policing could harm their own communities, worsen racial tensions and disproportionately target the Black and Latino communities that have long dealt with aggressive policing.

“I’ve rarely seen people who are more socially privileged be the ones accused of hate crimes,” said Anne Oredeko, the supervising attorney with the racial justice unit at Legal Aid, a public defenders group.

Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a social services agency, said many of his Asian colleagues were verbally harassed during the pandemic but chose not to alert law enforcement because they worried the perpetrators, who were often people of color, could be mistreated by police.

“I asked myself, do I want this person in jail?” said Alice Wong, one of Ho’s colleagues. “Just because you put someone in jail doesn’t make them not hate anyone anymore.”

"Asian Americans Are Being Attacked. Why Are Hate Crime Charges So Rare?

Nicole Hong, Jonah E. Bromwich

New York Times

2021-03-18

NEW YORK — On a cold evening last month, a Chinese man was walking home near Manhattan’s Chinatown neighborhood when a stranger suddenly ran up behind him and plunged a knife into his back.

For many Asian Americans, the stabbing was horrifying but not surprising. It was widely seen as just the latest example of racially targeted violence against Asians during the pandemic.

But the perpetrator, a 23-year-old man from Yemen, had not said a word to the victim before the attack, investigators said. Prosecutors determined they lacked enough evidence to prove a racist motive. The attacker was charged with attempted murder but not as a hate crime.

The announcement outraged Asian American leaders in New York City. Many of them protested outside the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office, demanding that the stabbing be prosecuted as a hate crime. They were tired of what they saw as racist assaults being overlooked by authorities.

“Let’s call it what it is,” said Don Lee, a community activist who spoke at the rally. “These are not random attacks. We’re asking for recognition that these crimes are happening.”

The rally reflected the public conversation over how to confront a rise in reports of violence against Asian Americans, who have felt increasingly vulnerable with each new attack. Many incidents have either not led to arrests or have not been charged as hate crimes, making it difficult to capture with reliable data the extent to which Asian Americans are being targeted.

That frustration erupted on a national scale this week after Robert Aaron Long, a white man, was charged with fatally shooting eight people, including six women of Asian descent, at spas in the Atlanta area Tuesday night.

Investigators said it was too early to determine a motive. After Long’s arrest, he denied harboring a racial bias and told officials that he carried out the shootings as a form of vengeance for his “sexual addiction.”

The Atlanta shootings and other recent attacks have exposed difficult questions involved in proving a racist motive. Did the assaults just happen to involve Asian victims? Or did the attackers purposely single out Asians in an unspoken way that can never be presented as evidence in court?

Many Asian Americans have been left wondering how much cultural stereotypes that cast them — especially women — as weak or submissive targets played a role.

Other incidents that clearly seemed racially motivated have not resulted in arrests. Police are still searching for a man who called an Asian American mother the “Chinese virus” and spat at her child in Queens last week.

As the debate over what legally qualifies as anti-Asian bias unfolds, the community is grappling with the reality that the law is simply not designed to account for many of the ways in which Asian Americans experience racism.

In New York state, to charge such attacks as hate crimes, prosecutors would need to show that the victims were targeted because of their race.

But proving a racist motive can be particularly difficult with attacks against Asians, experts say. There is no widely recognized symbol of anti-Asian hate comparable to a noose or a swastika. Historically, many Asian crime victims around the country were small-business owners who were robbed, complicating the question of motive.

“There’s a recognizable prototype with anti-Black or anti-Semitic or anti-gay hate crime,” said Lu-in Wang, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh. “They’re often more clear-cut.”

Asian Americans are sharply divided over the best measures to curb the violence, reflecting the wide ideological and generational differences within a group that encompasses dozens of ethnicities. There are about 1.2 million Asians in New York City, according to census data, making up 14% of the city’s population.

Some have called for lowering the bar to bring hate crime charges, toughening penalties and boosting funding for the New York Police Department to investigate attacks against Asians.

Others have opposed these proposals, saying more policing could harm their own communities, worsen racial tensions and disproportionately target the Black and Latino communities that have long dealt with aggressive policing.

“I’ve rarely seen people who are more socially privileged be the ones accused of hate crimes,” said Anne Oredeko, the supervising attorney with the racial justice unit at Legal Aid, a public defenders group.

Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a social services agency, said many of his Asian colleagues were verbally harassed during the pandemic but chose not to alert law enforcement because they worried the perpetrators, who were often people of color, could be mistreated by police.

“I asked myself, do I want this person in jail?” said Alice Wong, one of Ho’s colleagues. “Just because you put someone in jail doesn’t make them not hate anyone anymore.”

Recognizing this challenge, some law enforcement officials have called for people who commit hate crimes to attend anti-racism classes as an alternative to prison.

The approach was used after four teenage girls last March assaulted a 52-year-old Asian woman on a bus in the Bronx while accusing her of spreading the coronavirus, according to prosecutors. One of the girls beat her with an umbrella.

With the consent of the victim, prosecutors allowed three of the girls to be cleared of criminal charges if they participated in an educational program on hate crimes for two months. Their identities have not been made public because they are minors.

Elizabeth OuYang, a civil rights lawyer who supervised the program, said the program helped debunk stereotypes for the girls, who are Black and grew up without much interaction with Asian Americans. By the end, OuYang felt confident that they were remorseful about what they had done.

“The girls are good kids,” OuYang said. “They’re not evil monsters. I swear on my mother’s grave they will not commit another hate crime again.”","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

"Visual timeline: What happened at Atlanta spa shootings

Padilla, Ramon; Petras, George; Loehrke, Janet; Beard, Stephen J.

USA Today

2021-03-17

Eight people, mostly women, were killed in three shootings within an hour of one another at spas in Atlanta on Tuesday night. A 21-year-old suspect is in custody.

Six victims are Asian, four of them of Korean ethnicity, and two are white. The killings followed a recent wave of attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.

Georgia law enforcement officials say it’s too early in the investigation to determine if the shootings constitute a hate crime, but they have not ruled it out.

Officials say the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, told them the acts were not racially motivated. Long told them he has a sexual addiction and frequently visited spas and wanted to eliminate them as a source of temptation. Authorities say they believe Long acted alone.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told NPR on Thursday that the investigation continues but said, ""at the moment it does not appear that the motive was racially motivated.""

However, Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies and the sociology department chair at Yale University, told USA TODAY it’s hard to disentangle race from the killings.

Cherokee County authorities charged Long with four counts of murder and one count of assault on Wednesday. He's expected to face additional charges in Atlanta.

Police arrested Long on his way to Florida, where, he told police, he intended to do “more acts.” He is being held at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center. He waived his right to an initial court appearance on Thursday.

The shootings and arrest took place in a three-hour period. Police made the arrest 150 miles from the shooting sites.

Here is what happened Tuesday:

4:50 p.m.
YOUNG’S ASIAN MASSAGE | Acworth, Georgia

Police find five people shot at the spa. Two are dead inside and two others die later at a hospital. A fifth victim, a man, remains hospitalized in stable condition.

The spa is in a commercial area about 30 miles north of Atlanta.

5:47 p.m.
GOLD MASSAGE SPA | Atlanta

Atlanta police find three women shot dead inside the spa, located about 27 miles south of the first shooting.

Moments later
AROMATHERAPY SPA | Atlanta

Police at Gold Massage Spa receive reports of shots fired at a third spa across the street. They find one woman fatally shot.

6-8 p.m.

Police recover video images of a suspect from surveillance cameras of nearby businesses. Police post them on social media and are contacted by members of the suspect’s family.

The family gives police the suspect’s mobile phone number and police begin tracking his movements. The highway patrol monitors Interstate 75.

8 p.m.
I-75, about 150 miles south of Atlanta

Georgia State Patrol and deputies from Crisp County are alerted that the suspect is traveling south on I-75 in a black 2007 Hyundai Tucson.

They use a PIT maneuver – a Precision Immobilization Technique in which an officer bumps the rear of a vehicle to force it off the road – to stop the suspect.

The suspect is arrested without further incident. A 9mm firearm is found inside the vehicle.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

"Visual timeline: What happened at Atlanta spa shootings

USA Today

2021-03-17

Eight people, mostly women, were killed in three shootings within an hour of one another at spas in Atlanta on Tuesday night. A 21-year-old suspect is in custody.

Six victims are Asian, four of them of Korean ethnicity, and two are white. The killings followed a recent wave of attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.

Georgia law enforcement officials say it’s too early in the investigation to determine if the shootings constitute a hate crime, but they have not ruled it out.

Officials say the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, told them the acts were not racially motivated. Long told them he has a sexual addiction and frequently visited spas and wanted to eliminate them as a source of temptation. Authorities say they believe Long acted alone.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told NPR on Thursday that the investigation continues but said, ""at the moment it does not appear that the motive was racially motivated.""

However, Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies and the sociology department chair at Yale University, told USA TODAY it’s hard to disentangle race from the killings.

Cherokee County authorities charged Long with four counts of murder and one count of assault on Wednesday. He's expected to face additional charges in Atlanta.

Police arrested Long on his way to Florida, where, he told police, he intended to do “more acts.” He is being held at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center. He waived his right to an initial court appearance on Thursday.

The shootings and arrest took place in a three-hour period. Police made the arrest 150 miles from the shooting sites.

Here is what happened Tuesday:

4:50 p.m.
YOUNG’S ASIAN MASSAGE | Acworth, Georgia

Police find five people shot at the spa. Two are dead inside and two others die later at a hospital. A fifth victim, a man, remains hospitalized in stable condition.

The spa is in a commercial area about 30 miles north of Atlanta.

5:47 p.m.
GOLD MASSAGE SPA | Atlanta

Atlanta police find three women shot dead inside the spa, located about 27 miles south of the first shooting.

Moments later
AROMATHERAPY SPA | Atlanta

Police at Gold Massage Spa receive reports of shots fired at a third spa across the street. They find one woman fatally shot.

6-8 p.m.

Police recover video images of a suspect from surveillance cameras of nearby businesses. Police post them on social media and are contacted by members of the suspect’s family.

The family gives police the suspect’s mobile phone number and police begin tracking his movements. The highway patrol monitors Interstate 75.

8 p.m.
I-75, about 150 miles south of Atlanta

Georgia State Patrol and deputies from Crisp County are alerted that the suspect is traveling south on I-75 in a black 2007 Hyundai Tucson.

They use a PIT maneuver – a Precision Immobilization Technique in which an officer bumps the rear of a vehicle to force it off the road – to stop the suspect.

The suspect is arrested without further incident. A 9mm firearm is found inside the vehicle.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

"Visual timeline: What happened at Atlanta spa shootings

Eight people, mostly women, were killed in three shootings within an hour of one another at spas in Atlanta on Tuesday night. A 21-year-old suspect is in custody.

Six victims are Asian, four of them of Korean ethnicity, and two are white. The killings followed a recent wave of attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.

Georgia law enforcement officials say it’s too early in the investigation to determine if the shootings constitute a hate crime, but they have not ruled it out.

Officials say the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, told them the acts were not racially motivated. Long told them he has a sexual addiction and frequently visited spas and wanted to eliminate them as a source of temptation. Authorities say they believe Long acted alone.

FBI Director Christopher Wray told NPR on Thursday that the investigation continues but said, ""at the moment it does not appear that the motive was racially motivated.""

However, Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies and the sociology department chair at Yale University, told USA TODAY it’s hard to disentangle race from the killings.

Cherokee County authorities charged Long with four counts of murder and one count of assault on Wednesday. He's expected to face additional charges in Atlanta.

Police arrested Long on his way to Florida, where, he told police, he intended to do “more acts.” He is being held at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center. He waived his right to an initial court appearance on Thursday.

The shootings and arrest took place in a three-hour period. Police made the arrest 150 miles from the shooting sites.

On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon everyday scenes of older people’s integration into the fabric of the city and community life.

People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of diabolo.

After three days of walking around Shanghai’s teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing’an Sculpture Park. An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He’d studied English in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.

Asian elders in America are vulnerable

Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco’s Japantown and a trio of elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach’s Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I’ve not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my hlau modeled aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.

Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland’s Chinatown. Other violence against Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and 75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.

Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren’t a cure-all, and public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.

COVID: Forget about the frenzy over COVID-19 variants, viral evolution is normal

These attacks haven’t occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity. Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer “eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic’s acute economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.

Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, “We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.”

'Bullets flying by your house'

Re-imagining community safety doesn’t mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction efforts targeted towards young people.

In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school’s mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer witnessing this small but important step forward.

“Even if you’re not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,” says Loren Taylor, a city council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings, I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.

'China virus' redux: For Trump and Republicans, it's open season on Asian Americans like me

Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn’t lose sight of public acts of interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public spaces and communities free from racial harm.

When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco’s Japanese Cultural Center in January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements, but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for generations to come.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon everyday scenes of older people’s integration into the fabric of the city and community life.

People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of diabolo.

After three days of walking around Shanghai’s teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing’an Sculpture Park. An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He’d studied English in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.

Asian elders in America are vulnerable

Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco’s Japantown and a trio of elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach’s Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I’ve not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my hlau modeled aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.

Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland’s Chinatown. Other violence against Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and 75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.

Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren’t a cure-all, and public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.

COVID: Forget about the frenzy over COVID-19 variants, viral evolution is normal

These attacks haven’t occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity. Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer “eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic’s acute economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.

Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, “We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.”

'Bullets flying by your house'

Re-imagining community safety doesn’t mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction efforts targeted towards young people.

In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school’s mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer witnessing this small but important step forward.

“Even if you’re not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,” says Loren Taylor, a city council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings, I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.

'China virus' redux: For Trump and Republicans, it's open season on Asian Americans like me

Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn’t lose sight of public acts of interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public spaces and communities free from racial harm.

When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco’s Japanese Cultural Center in January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements, but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for generations to come.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer “eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic’s acute economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.

Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, “We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.”

'Bullets flying by your house'

Re-imagining community safety doesn’t mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction efforts targeted towards young people.

In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school’s mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer witnessing this small but important step forward.

“Even if you’re not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,” says Loren Taylor, a city council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings, I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.

'China virus' redux: For Trump and Republicans, it's open season on Asian Americans like me

Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn’t lose sight of public acts of interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public spaces and communities free from racial harm.

When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco’s Japanese Cultural Center in January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements, but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for generations to come.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon everyday scenes of older people’s integration into the fabric of the city and community life.

People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of diabolo.

After three days of walking around Shanghai’s teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing’an Sculpture Park. An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He’d studied English in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.

Asian elders in America are vulnerable

Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco’s Japantown and a trio of elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach’s Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I’ve not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my hlau modeled aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.

Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland’s Chinatown. Other violence against Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and 75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.

Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren’t a cure-all, and public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.

COVID: Forget about the frenzy over COVID-19 variants, viral evolution is normal

These attacks haven’t occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity. Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer “eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable.

On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon everyday scenes of older people’s integration into the fabric of the city and community life.

People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of diabolo.

After three days of walking around Shanghai’s teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing’an Sculpture Park. An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He’d studied English in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.

Asian elders in America are vulnerable

Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco’s Japantown and a trio of elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach’s Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I’ve not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my hlau modeled aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.

Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland’s Chinatown. Other violence against Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and 75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.

Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren’t a cure-all, and public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.

COVID: Forget about the frenzy over COVID-19 variants, viral evolution is normal

These attacks haven’t occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity. Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer “eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic’s acute economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.

Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, “We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.”

'Bullets flying by your house'

Re-imagining community safety doesn’t mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction efforts targeted towards young people.

In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school’s mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer witnessing this small but important step forward.

“Even if you’re not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,” says Loren Taylor, a city council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings, I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.

'China virus' redux: For Trump and Republicans, it's open season on Asian Americans like me

Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn’t lose sight of public acts of interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public spaces and communities free from racial harm.

When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco’s Japanese Cultural Center in January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements, but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for generations to come.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)

On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon everyday scenes of older people’s integration into the fabric of the city and community life.

People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of diabolo.

After three days of walking around Shanghai’s teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing’an Sculpture Park. An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He’d studied English in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.

Asian elders in America are vulnerable

Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco’s Japantown and a trio of elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach’s Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I’ve not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my hlau modeled aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.

Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland’s Chinatown. Other violence against Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and 75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.

Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren’t a cure-all, and public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.

COVID: Forget about the frenzy over COVID-19 variants, viral evolution is normal

These attacks haven’t occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity. Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer “eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic’s acute economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.

Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, “We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.”

'Bullets flying by your house'

Re-imagining community safety doesn’t mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction efforts targeted towards young people.

In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school’s mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer witnessing this small but important step forward.

“Even if you’re not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,” says Loren Taylor, a city council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings, I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.

'China virus' redux: For Trump and Republicans, it's open season on Asian Americans like me

Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn’t lose sight of public acts of interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public spaces and communities free from racial harm.

When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco’s Japanese Cultural Center in January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements, but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for generations to come.","COVID-19/coronavirus/pandemic (Triggering anti-Asian hate)
