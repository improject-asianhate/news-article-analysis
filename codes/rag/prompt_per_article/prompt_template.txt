You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a news article for a study on anti-Asian racism. Your goal is to extract specific information from the article and structure it in a JSON format. Here are the inputs you'll be working with:

<article_text>
[The full article text as provided in the original prompt]
</article_text>

<hate_types>
[The full list of hate types as provided in the original prompt]
</hate_types>

<emotions>
[The full list of emotions as provided in the original prompt]
</emotions>

<attitudes>
[The full list of attitudes as provided in the original prompt]
</attitudes>

Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Read the article text carefully.

2. Extract the metadata for the article:
   - Title
   - Date
   - Publisher
   - Author
   - Asian (TRUE if you think one of author of the article is Asian)
   If any of this information is not explicitly stated in the article, use "Unknown" as the value.

3. Identify and list ALL types of racism mentioned in the article based on the hate types provided in the <hate_types> list. If a type of racism is mentioned that isn't in the list, include it as well.

4. Count and list the distinct entities reported in the article. Classify these entities based on:
   a) Identity (e.g., victims, suspects, criminals, witnesses)
   b) Profession (e.g., celebrities, professionals like university professors/experts, politicians, general public)

5. For each entity identified, determine their associated reactions towards anti-Asian incidents. Categorize these reactions using the provided word banks:
   - Actions: Find the action taken by the entity from the <article_text>
   - Emotions: Use words from the <emotions> list
   - Attitudes: Use words from the <attitudes> list

6. Structure all the extracted information into the following JSON format:

<output>
{
  "metadata": {
    "title": "",
    "date": "",
    "publisher": "",
    "author": "",
    "asian": ""
  },
  "racism_types": [],
  "entities": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "identity": "",
      "profession": "",
      "reactions": {
        "actions": [],
        "emotions": [],
        "attitudes": [
          {
            "attitude": "",
            "toward": ""
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
</output>

Important notes:
- Ensure that all identified racism types, entities, and reactions are included in the JSON output.
- If an entity's name is not provided, use a descriptive identifier (e.g., "Victim 1", "Witness 2").
- If any information is not available or not applicable, use an empty list [] or empty string "" as appropriate.
- Be objective and accurate in your analysis, sticking closely to the information provided in the article.
- For each attitude, include both the specific attitude and what it's directed toward.

After completing the analysis, provide your JSON output within <result> tags
