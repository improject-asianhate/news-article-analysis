A year ago, Lunar New Year celebrations unfolded as COVID-19 began spreading globally, ushering in a new
wave of anti-Asian bias stoked by then-President Trump and the xenophobic rhetoric he used in labeling the
disease the “China virus.”
Now, as festivities this weekend mark another Lunar New Year, coronavirus vaccines offer relief from the virus
but not from the racism directed at people of Asian descent, who have seen the bias turn to violence, notably
against the elderly. The cases include the murder in San Francisco of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai
man; a subway attack in New York City during which a 61-year-old Flipino man was slashed across the face with
a knife; and several assaults targeting older Asian Americans in the Chinatown section of Oakland, Calif.
“This is not a problem that is new to our community,” Sam Hyun, chairman of the Massachusetts Asian American
Commission, said Saturday. “Even last year when we saw the spike happening, what we heard was a lot of
silence from the media and those in the highest seats of power.”
The national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 67 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and
discrimination between March 19 and Dec. 31, 2020, according to data released Tuesday.
Almost 90 percent of the cases from Massachusetts involved verbal harassment, about 7.5 percent were reports
of people being coughed on or spat upon, and 3 percent were physical assaults, said Russell Jeung, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor at San Francisco State University.
In one local incident reported to the organization, an Asian-American shopper said a woman at a grocery store
stated, “You will infect us.”
In another report from Massachusetts, a pedestrian said a driver screamed, “You're the reason I have to wear a
mask.” An elementary school teacher in Massachusetts reported that a student taunted a Chinese classmate by
claiming he had COVID-19 and telling other children not to go near him.
Jeung said only a small portion of the incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate would qualify for prosecution under
most laws against hate crimes.
“To address most of the hate incidents, we need a different type of policy solution and that includes expanded
civil rights enforcement,” he said.
A bill to reform the state's hate crime statute is pending in the Legislature and would expand the law to cover
harassment. Attorney General Maura Healey is co-sponsoring the legislation.
On Tuesday, she encouraged people to report hate crimes against Asian Americans to her office.
“Anti-Asian violence is on the rise,” she wrote. “The recent assaults on our elders are deeply disturbing.”
The state's Asian American Commission has developed a system for collecting reports about hate incidents and
has been using its online platforms to promote resources to combat the violence. Last spring, the commission
published a manual for responding to anti-Asian violence.
While several prominent activists and organizers said they haven't received reports about local Asian
communities being subjected to the same type of violence documented in California and New York, the incidents
have taken a psychological toll.
“It just adds to their level of stress,” said Ben Hires, chief executive of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood
Center.
Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents Chinatown, said some of the neighborhood's elderly residents
worry about leaving their homes to buy food or get fresh air because they fear being harassed in public.
“We have to show more empathy to the Asian community for the very difficult year that they've had,” said
Flynn. “They need to know that we're on their side and we're going to do everything we can to be helpful when
there is discrimination and bullying and intimidation or name calling.”
One way some advocates are trying to fight anti-Asian bias is by encouraging bystanders to speak up when they
witness wrongdoing. Distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, and immigration status sometimes prevent
victims from coming forward and that's why it's important for others to step up, they said.
“A lot of the folks that are being targeted, they're not going to be able to defend themselves or they're not going to report it so we need to the community speak up for them,” Hires said.
President Biden addressed the racism, harassment, and hate crimes directed in a video marking the Lunar New Year.
“It's simply wrong,” he said. “It's a stain on our national character. Every person, no matter their race,
background, religion, or language they speak, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.”
Last month, Biden signed an executive order condemning anti-Asian racism and directed the Department of
Justice to tackle the problem more aggressively.
Jessica “Jay” Wong, interim executive director of the Asian American Commission, said her community needs
to hear more messages of support from local leaders.
“We need our leaders to show that they are actively working to make our community feel safe and not feel
alone,” she said. “None of this should ever be tolerated.”
