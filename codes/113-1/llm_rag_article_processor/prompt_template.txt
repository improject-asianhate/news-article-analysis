Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Read the article text carefully. Also, read the related context below carefully.

{context}

2. Extract the metadata for the article:
   - Title
   - Date
   - Publisher
   - Author
   - Asian (say "true" if you think one of author of the article is Asian, say "false" otherwise)
   If any of this information is not explicitly stated in the article, use "Unknown" as the value.

3. Identify and list ALL types of racism mentioned in the article based on the hate types provided in the <hate_types> list. If a type of racism is mentioned that isn't in the list, include it as well.

4. Count and list the distinct entities reported in the article. Classify these entities based on:
   a) Identity (e.g., victims, suspects, criminals, witnesses)
   b) Profession (e.g., celebrities, professionals like university professors/experts, politicians, general public)

5. For each entity identified, determine their associated reactions towards anti-Asian incidents. Categorize these reactions using the provided word banks:
   - Actions: Find the action taken by the entity from the <article_text>
   - Emotions: Use one of the eight basic emotions: joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, disgust, trust, or anticipation. If the emotion is not explicitly stated, use "Unknown".
   - Attitudes: Positive, Negative, Neutral or Ambiguous. If the attitude is not explicitly stated, use "Ambiguous". If the attitude is stated but not clear, use "Neutral".

6. Structure all the extracted information into the following JSON format:

<output>
{{
  "metadata": {{
    "title": "",
    "date": "",
    "publisher": "",
    "author": "",
    "asian": ""
  }},
  "racism_types": [],
  "entities": [
    {{
      "name": "",
      "identity": "",
      "profession": "",
      "reactions": {{
        "actions": [],
        "emotions": [],
        "attitudes": [
          {{
            "attitude": "",
            "toward": ""
          }}
        ]
      }}
    }}
  ]
}}
</output>

Important notes:
- Ensure that all identified racism types, entities, and reactions are included in the JSON output.
- If an entity's name is not provided, use a descriptive identifier (e.g., "Victim 1", "Witness 2").
- If any information is not available or not applicable, use an empty list [] or empty string "" as appropriate.
- Be objective and accurate in your analysis, sticking closely to the information provided in the article.
- For each attitude, include both the specific attitude and what it's directed toward.

After completing the analysis, provide your JSON output within <result> tags
