Sonali Malaviya never obsessed about her sleep, until now. ""Normally, I would go to bed at 10:30 in the night and wake up by 6 am,"" says the Gurgaon-based tech marketing
professional, who is in her early 40s. Over the last three months, though, she has been getting up at 3 am every night. ""I check my sleep tracking app once a week and it
shows that I am only getting four hours of sleep every day.
Typically, when you wake up in the night, you go back to sleep. These days the mind is never at rest so that is not happening anymore,"" says Malaviya, filing it under latent
Covid-19 stress.
The lack of sleep has emerged as a major casualty in the wake of the global pandemic and the subsequent lockdown it has brought about in many countries, say insomnia
therapists around the world. People across age groups are worried about catching Covid or passing it on to their family. They are concerned about job security. In many cases,
the lockdown restrictions leave them with nothing time-bound to wake up to either. All these have led to ""almost everyone"" seeking therapy complaining of lack of sleep or a
ruptured sleep cycle, say the therapists. And at least one-third of these are facing this issue for the first time.
Ravi Kant, a 27-year-old student from IIM-Shillong, started having sleepless nights after the lockdown forced him to return to his hometown, Patna, thereby disrupting his
college routine. Though the classes shifted online, worries about an uncertain future keep him wide awake till the wee hours of the morning. He now uses the time between
midnight and 6 am to focus on studying instead.
76663983""If users express anxiety over tracking their sleep, we advise them to scrap the trackers and concentrate on how they feel in the morning. That is the best sleep
quality score you will ever get"" Carl Johan Hederoth, CEO, Sleep Cycle
""Family has also accepted this as my new normal."" As people are getting sleepless in Seattle, Shoreditch and Shillong, some are reaching out to tech for help. The downloads of
sleep tracking app Sleep Monitor were up by 1.5X between April and May, and by 2X from May to June so far, at over a million Android installs. ""We saw a lot of users from the
US and European countries (mainly from France, Italy, the UK, German, Turkey, Poland) from March to May,"" says a company spokesperson via email. ""In May and June, we saw
users increasingly downloading the app from Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. All those were organic users.""
76663832""People of colour are likely to have more sleep-related anxieties during these times. They prefer going to practitioners of colour but there aren't a lot of insomnia
experts of colour in the country"" Joshua Tal, sleep and health psychologist, New York
Medication for sleep is the most preferred route in the US, say the therapists. In India, however, people prefer trying yoga, exercises, sleep-centric music and podcasts.
Sleep featured in the top 10 moods for users in India every week on Spotify since mid-April. Over the last three months, India was also among the top 10 streaming markets for
popular sleep podcasts on the music-streaming app, according to data shared by the company's PR team.
Over 40% of the people approaching MindPeers, a mental health tech platform, suffer from sleep-related issues, says founder Kanika Agarwal who shuttles between Delhi and
Singapore. ""Some people who reached out hadn't slept in 3-4 days,"" she says. The platform is active in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru at present. Ishita Pateria, a counselling
psychologist based in Mumbai, says she has seen a 70% spike in mild to major cases of insomnia among her clients in the past two months.

daysSleep featured in Top 10 moods on Spotify for Indian users every week since mid-AprilJust why are so many people around the world having sleepless nights these days?
Lindsay Browning, a sleep expert from London, explains it with an analogy: ""If you see a lion coming to attack you, you will not be able to fall asleep, will you? Your body senses
it to be a life-threatening danger and reacts accordingly. Heart rate goes up, so does your breathing rate, and there is a sudden rush of adrenaline.
It prompts the person to run in the opposite direction."" Covid-19 is what many see as a similar danger coming at them. ""But this time you can't physically run away."" So, the
body responds to stress by staying awake.
76663842""Short-term sleep problems aren't going to kill anybody. Else, every new set of parents would be dead. Our bodies will be able to recover from this"" Lindsay Browning,
sleep expert, London
The lockdown-led challenges don't help. The human body has a circadian rhythm that takes cues from the sun to follow a routine which keeps them awake during the day and
asleep at night. ""A lot of people, say, in countries like Italy and cities like New York, live in flats that don't get enough sunshine to get these cues. While working from home,

Trump Asian Reporter.png
President Trump has certainly made some racist comments during his time in politics. But his abrupt dismissal of CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang at Monday evening’s press
conference isn’t one of them. Of course, that didn’t stop liberal journalists en masse from trying to make the story themselves, baselessly crying racism for the billionth time. As
always, they fail to appreciate that they are diluting the charge for whenever it is actually warranted.
Here’s the exchange that prompted so much outcry.
Jiang asked Trump an antagonistic question, as is her right, demanding that he explain why he views coronavirus testing as a “global competition” and questioning his motives
while “everyday Americans are losing their lives.”
Trump responded, “Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question. … You
may get a very unusual answer.”
Then, Trump tried to move on, but Jiang interjected again and asked, “Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?” The reporter’s follow-up question and intonation were
clearly meant to accuse the president of racism, as she is an Asian American. Apparently, the thought didn’t cross her mind that Trump may have said that to her “specifically”
because she was the one who asked him the question.
“I’m not saying it specifically to anybody. … I’m saying it to anyone that would ask a nasty question like that,” Trump replied. A bit more discord ensued, and when the gaggle of
reporters wouldn’t move on, Trump abruptly ended the press conference and stormed out.
You can watch the full exchange for yourself below:Trump Press Conference
Naturally, liberal journalists decided to take an incident that otherwise may have reflected on the president somewhat poorly merely for his lack of decorum and suffer an
unhinged meltdown trying without basis to make Trump’s deflection a racist attack on an Asian American journalist.
CNN’s Brian Stelter immediately cried racism, saying shortly after this incident, on-air, that “what we saw in that exchange with Weijia Jiang was something that has racial
overtones. It's racist to look at an Asian American White House correspondent and say, 'Ask China.'” He was one of many left-wing journalists to jump to this charge, with his
CNN colleague Wolf Blitzer calling the president’s behavior “very ugly.”
And here’s just a small sample of the truly unhinged pity party that quickly descended on left-wing social media, as #WeijiaJiang trended:TweetTweetTweetTweet
Trump has been laying blame for the coronavirus pandemic on China and on its regime since day one of the crisis. Rightly or wrongly, he has time and time again deflected
criticism of his administration’s decision-making by pivoting to China. All he did this time was do this once again in response to essentially the same question as always — but
this time coming from an Asian American reporter.
No one deserves to be demeaned or insulted for his or her race or ethnicity. Trump did not do this to Jiang, and the reaction to this has been utterly ridiculous.
UPDATE: This story has been corrected to reflect that CNN's Wolf Blitzer, not CNN's Oliver Darcy, called the president's behavior ""very ugly.""

New York, March 17 (IANS) The man who killed eight people in shootings at Atlanta massage parlours may have
been impelled by ""sex addiction"", officials said on Wednesday although six of the victims were of Asian descent.
A 21-year-old White man, Robert Aaron Long, is in custody and he has admitted to carrying out the Tuesday
evening shooting at three locations, officials said.
The killings of people of Asian descent came as the country was being swept by a wave of violence against
them.
But Sheriff's Office Captain Jay Baker said at a news conference on Wednesday that two of the victims were
White and that Long ""does claim that it was not racially motivated"".
Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Long ""made indicators that he has some issues, potentially sexual addiction, and
may have frequented some of these places in the past"".
Baker added that Long told them he considered the spas ""as an outlet for him"" to do ""something he shouldn't be
doing"" and that he wanted ""to take out that temptation"".
Seven of those killed were women and the South Korean Foreign Ministry said that four of them were of Korean
descent.

FOND DU LAC - The case against a man charged with killing a retired police officer by hitting him with his pickup
truck could combine two rare elements in a Wisconsin court case: a hate-crime charge and an insanity defense.
Prosecutors say the killing of retired police officer Phillip A. Thiessen, 55, of Fond du Lac is a hate crime because
Thiessen was targeted because of his race — Thiessen was white and defendant Daniel Navarro, a Mexican-
American, told police he intended to kill a white person.
Statements Navarro is accused of making to police immediately after the crash — unless his attorney can get a
judge to throw them out — would likely eliminate several potential defenses.
""Navarro stated he intentionally crashed into the motorcycle, head-on,"" District Attorney Eric Toney said in a
criminal complaint. Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Sgt. Logan Will, who spoke with Navarro minutes after the July
3 crash, said Navarro told him, ""It was intentional, sir.""
Navarro's truck left no skid marks or other signs he tried to avoid Thiessen before a head-on collision on
Winnebago Drive in Taycheedah, the complaint says. There is no evidence the two knew each other before the
crash.
Prosecutors also say Navarro said white people had been harassing him, ""giving him acid"" and contaminated
him with a chemical sterilizer.

Navarro, 27, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide with a deadly weapon as a hate crime, and first-
degree recklessly endangering safety with a dangerous weapon, as a hate crime. He is in Fond du Lac County
Jail in lieu of $1 million bond.
Navarro is due in county circuit court on Wednesday for arraignment.
The law since 1988
Hate-crimes — crimes motivated by bigotry — became illegal under a measure the state Legislature adopted in
1988.
Then Rep. David Clarenbach, D-Madison, authored the bill after incidents including cross burnings, the painting
of a swastika on a synagogue and the killing of a white woman walking in a mall parking lot with a Black man,
according to a 1988 report in the Janesville Gazette.
""If a man is assaulted because he is Black,"" Clarenbach said, ""the penalty for assault should be enhanced to
reflect the intimidation connected with the crime.""
Hate crimes ""enhancers,"" as they are known, allow increased fines and prison time for crimes that target people
because of race and ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability or gender. A judge can add up to $5,000,
and/or an additional five years in prison to the sentence of someone convicted of a hate-crime felony.
Race and ethnicity remain the most common reasons for hate crimes in the state, and in the nation, statistics
show.
Nationally, the FBI says, Blacks were the targets of 1,943 hate crimes in 2018 — more than any other race,
figures show. Next are whites, at 762, and Latinos, at 485.
Perhaps the state's best-known hate crime is the August 2012 mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in
Oak Creek, near Milwaukee. A white supremacist killed six people, including four priests, and wounded four
others before killing himself after being shot by an Oak Creek police officer.
Another victim, paralyzed in the attack, died earlier this year.
Today, though, Wisconsin's hate-crime cases remain fairly rare, U.S. Justice Department figures show.
Since 2014, when 51 were reported, the numbers declined for two years, then nudged back up to 46 in 2017,
and rose again to 53 in 2018, the most recent year for which figures were available.
Hate crimes, insanity defense
When he spoke to deputies at the crash scene, and detectives later that night, Navarro told sheriff's officials he
hadn't nodded off at the wheel. Nor did he claim Thiessen was riding in a way that would have caused Navarro
to think he needed to defend himself against the motorcyclist, based on what witnesses told police.
That limits his options in terms of a criminal defense, meaning his best defense might involve employing an
""insanity defense"" — making the case about his mental condition.
That approach — pleading not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, commonly labeled an ""insanity
defense"" or ""NGI"" — is available, but rarely used. Black's Law Dictionary says it's employed in less than 1% of
Wisconsin criminal cases.
Defense Attorney Jeffrey Jensen wasn't available for comment but had indicated after a brief court proceeding in
July that he might consider a defense based on Navarro's mental health.
In an insanity defense, the defendant must admit he or she committed the crime. A defense attorney must then

convince the court that his client couldn't understand his actions were wrong, and couldn't stop himself from
committing the crime.
The defense could also convince a court the defendant knew his actions were wrong but couldn't ""conform his
conduct to the law"" — something Marquette University Law Professor Michael O'Hear called ""the irresistible
impulse.""
At trial, both sides will call expert witnesses who've examined the defendant. The defense's expert will likely
testify that the defendant should be found not guilty because of his mental condition and the prosecution's
will disagree.
Even then, a successful insanity defense won't necessarily keep a defendant from being locked up for a long
time. Defendants who are found guilty, but not responsible, are typically confined to a psychiatric institution,
not released into the community or sent to prison. And in Wisconsin cases where a jury accepts an insanity
defense, a judge can reject that finding.
Kenneth Freeman of Milwaukee was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect this year for killing
Froedtert Hospital nurse practitioner Carlie Beaudin, 33, as she walked to her car after a 2019 shift at the
hospital. A judge in Milwaukee County sentenced Freeman in March to spend the rest of his life in a secure
mental facility.
Wisconsin's best known — and perhaps only — hate-crime case to employ an insanity defense resulted in
three life sentences plus 20 years for a Milwaukee County man who gunned down neighbors Phia and Mai Vue
and Jesus Manso-Perez, and tried to kill a fourth in a racially motivated attack. Jurors rejected Dan Popp's
claim that mental illness kept him from acting lawfully.
Insanity-defense cases usually involve testimony about the defendant's mental health over time. Should
Navarro employ such a defense, it could pose challenges.
As USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reported in July, Navarro's family, a prosecutor, and a judge had raised
concerns in the past about Navarro's mental state. But while multiple people raised red flags, there was little
immediate evidence that he had undergone an evaluation.
His sister in 2019 had described him to Fond du Lac police as a germophobe who wouldn't pick something up
without paper towels or toilet paper in his hands. Another relative told authorities a doctor had recommended
he have a mental health evaluation. And the Fond du Lac County circuit judge overseeing his 2019 disorderly-
conduct case had ordered a psychological evaluation.
But when one a test was not conducted in the time called for under law, the judge released Navarro from jail
and withdrew the order.

Recent Wisconsin hate crimes
Wisconsin has seen some hate-driven crimes of violence recently. Some exhibit an element of pre-planning.
Milwaukee resident Clifton Blackwell, 62, is set for trial in November on a felony charge of first-degree
reckless injury as a hate crime. Prosecutors say he threw acid in the face of 42-year-old U.S. citizen Mahud
Villalaz outside a Milwaukee restaurant last fall after making anti-immigrant remarks and accusing Villalaz of
""invading"" the U.S.
Villalaz suffered facial burns. He has recovered.

""Every day, I pray that you people die.""
That's just one example of the kind of insults and name-calling that half of Chinese Canadians say they have experienced since the coronavirus pandemic arrived in North
America, according to a poll by Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta released Monday.
The survey results, taken from 516 Canadians who self-identify as ethnically Chinese, suggest just how commonplace racist behaviour against people of East Asian descent has
become since the pandemic arrived in North America.
Forty-three per cent of respondents said they have been personally threatened or intimidated at least once, and 13 per cent said it happens frequently. Eight per cent of
respondents said they have frequently been physically attacked by strangers.
Researchers from the university helped craft the questions in the survey, conducted June 15-18. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points, 19
times out of 20.
The goal was to collect data on how Chinese Canadians' experience has changed since the pandemic started dominating headlines, said Angus Reid Institute executive director
Shachi Kurl.
""What has made the news and what we hear about tends to be the really overt, violent, more extreme examples"" of such prejudice, she said.
In Vancouver, a man pushed a 92-year-old man with dementia to the ground outside a convenience store while yelling racist insults about COVID-19. In another incident, a man
punched a woman of Asian descent near a bus stop downtown and walked away.
Even Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has been targeted. Conservative MP Derek Sloan questioned her loyalty to Canada in April, asking, is she ""working for
Canada or working for China?""
""No doubt there would be some out there who say these are just isolated examples,"" said Kurl. ""This study really aims to measure the breadth and the scope and size of the
issue - and now we have a sense of that.""
Six in 10 respondents said they have changed some aspect of their routine in order to avoid abuse, ""run-ins"" or ""unpleasant encounters"" since the pandemic was declared in
Canada. Fifty per cent said they have been insulted or called names due to their ethnicity. One in three survey respondents said they have been made to feel like they posed a
threat to the health and safety of others.
Of the people who participated in the survey, 44 per cent per cent were born in Canada, 22 per cent in China, 22 per cent in Hong Kong and three per cent from Taiwan. Ten per
cent were born in another country.
Nearly 90 per cent of respondents said that being Canadian was an important part of their identity and that they love Canada and what it stands for. Yet a quarter said they feel
like outsiders in their own country. Of those who were born in Canada, one in five said they felt like outsiders.
""These data shows us that everything from insults to a sense of othering, to being made to feel that somehow you're to blame for this - it's all part of what affects someone's
psyche,"" said Kurl.
In a 2016 Angus Reid poll, about half of visible-minority respondents said they believe others see them as Canadians ""all the time."" Respondents in this most recent survey
were asked the same question. Only 13 per cent said they feel this way.
A majority (64 per cent) of respondents said they believe North American news outlets have had a negative effect on Canadians' views of people of Chinese ethnicity.
""The whole point of taking measurement of this is we are no longer dealing with anecdotes. This is something that brings empirical data, that brings facts to what has been, up
to this point, more of an anecdotal conversation,"" said Kurl. ""You can't argue with that.""
The survey, designed with help from University of Alberta researchers, also gave respondents a chance to share details from their experiences. Some of the anonymized
responses were published in the report.
One person wrote, ""While walking on the streets in Kitsilano (Vancouver), a Caucasian man in his 30s said to me and my daughter, 'Every day, I pray that you people die.'""

A survey in Canada has confirmed reports that racism against people of Chinese ethnicity has been on the rise since the country reported its first cases
of Covid-19 in March.
Half of the Chinese-Canadians polled said they had been called names or insulted as a direct consequence of the pandemic and 43 per cent said they
had been personally threatened or intimidated.
More than 60 per cent of respondents had adjusted their daily routines in a bid to avoid unpleasant encounters.
The survey, which questioned 516 Canadians of Chinese ethnicity, was conducted by the University of Alberta and the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit
public opinion research agency, against a backdrop of rising anti-China and anti-Asian racism, as well as xenophobia.
Vancouver police said in May that anti-Asian hate crime was on the rise, with 16 reports made in March and April, compared to 12 in the whole of 2019.
Also in May, two lion statues at the entrance to the city's Chinatown were defaced twice with racist graffiti.
Discrimination has been stoked by the use of terms such as ""Chinese virus"" and ""Wuhan virus"" by senior figures in the United States, including
President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. While Trump dropped references to the ""Chinese virus"" in late March, he has recently
returned to racially charged terms like ""kung flu"" and ""Chinese flu"" at his campaign events.
The survey found two-thirds of respondents felt coverage from North American news outlets had led to negative views of Chinese-Canadians, while
three in 10 said they were frequently exposed to racist graffiti or messaging on social media.
A quarter said they were treated with less respect because of their Chinese ethnicity and a similar share said they were made to feel as though they
posed a threat to the health and safety of their fellow Canadians.
One man in his 60s told the survey team he had been spat at by a cyclist, while a woman in her 20s said: ""Walking down the street with a mask on,
there have been instances where people will scream at me to go back to China or swear and say other racist remarks. I look Chinese but I am not from
China, even though I have Chinese heritage. Makes it all very confusing.""
Another respondent, a woman in her 30s, said she had been repeatedly yelled at in the streets of her neighbourhood.

Editor's Note: The China Society for Human Rights Studies on Thursday released an article titled ""The COVID-19
Pandemic Magnifies the Crisis of 'U.S.-Style Human Rights'."" Following is the full text:
The sudden and unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global public health
emergency that humanity has experienced since the end of World War II. It is also a ""big test of human rights
conditions"" for all countries across the globe. The virus does not respect borders, nor is race or nationality relevant
in the face of the disease. Given this, to honor our common commitment to human rights, governments of different
countries are obliged to adopt scientific measures for the prevention and control of the virus and do their best to
ensure the health and safety of their people. Nevertheless, the U.S. government's self-interested, short-sighted,
inefficient, and irresponsible response to the pandemic has not only caused the tragedy in which about 2 million
Americans became infected with the virus and more than 110,000 have died from it, but also caused the exposure
and deterioration of the long-existing problems within the United States, such as a divisive society, the polarization
between the rich and the poor, racial discrimination, and the inadequate protection of the rights and interests of
vulnerable groups. This has led the American people into grave human rights disasters.
1. The U.S. Government's Ineffective Response to the Pandemic Leading to Human Rights Disasters
Being distracted, slack, and opinionated in the face of the pandemic, the United States Federal Government
declared a national emergency on March 13, after tens of thousands of deaths had occurred. The pandemic
statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States showed that as of June 9 Eastern Standard
Time (EST), there had been 1,971,302 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 111,620 deaths from the virus in the
United States, with both figures significantly higher than those of other countries. For the United States, which

boasts the strongest economic and technological strength and the most abundant medical resources in the world,
this is a sad irony.
Ignoring the Pandemic Warnings. According to the revisited timeline of the pandemic in the United States, which
was released by The New York Times and Washington Post in April 2020, the U.S. government had repeatedly
ignored the pandemic warnings and slacked off on pandemic control. In early January, the National Security Council
(NSC) received intelligence reports predicting the spread of the virus in the United States. On January 29, Peter
Navarro, Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy at the White House, laid out in striking detail the
potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic: as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic
losses. U.S. health officials and medical experts, such as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and
Human Services Alex Azar, also repeatedly warned of the deadly pandemic in the United States. Unfortunately, the
U.S. government ignored these warnings. Instead, it focused on controlling the spreading of information, restricted
medical experts' freedom to release information on the pandemic to the public, and even published false
information to mislead the public, such as calling the virus ""a flu"", claiming that the virus has low infection and
fatality rates, and saying that ""One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear."" Under such circumstances, the ""golden
window"" period for infectious disease prevention and control was wasted. Even then, many members of the U.S.
Senate, including Richard Burr, who was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, were involved in
insider trading scandals. They used their positions to understand the serious situation of the pandemic earlier, but
they downplayed the risk of the pandemic in front of the public while selling a large number of stocks before the
pandemic triggered a stock market crash. In this way, they had a ""perfect hedge"".
Prioritizing Capital Interests. The website of The New York Times reported on April 13, 2020, that the White House
COVID-19 Response Working Group and the NSC jointly prepared a memo dated February 14, which was titled
""U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus."" According to the report, the memo documented
drastic pandemic-control measures including: ""significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all
sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. Consider
school closures."" Nevertheless, the decision-makers immediately rejected the memo after hearing that the
measures would lead to the collapse of the U.S. stock market. This showed how the U.S. government prioritized
capital interests and the response of the capital market, rather than making the people's right to life and health a
priority. Due to this, the U.S. government failed to give effective warnings to the public and failed to get prepared
for the potential consumption of medical resources caused by the pandemic, bringing the American people to the
brink of infection and death.
Politicizing the Anti-pandemic Endeavor. When the virus broke out in the United States, some U.S. politicians used it
as a weapon to attack political opponents and seek election benefits instead of regarding the drive to protect the
lives and health of their people as their top priority. The website of The Lancet, an authoritative medical journal,
published an editorial on May 16, which was a rare case for the journal. The editorial explicitly pointed out the
intervention of political parties in the public health sector of the United States, and the weakening role of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It criticized the U.S. government for not actively adopting basic
medical and anti-pandemic measures such as detection, tracking, and isolation, placing its hopes on ""magic bullets""
such as vaccines and new drugs, and hoping that the virus would eventually ""magically disappear"". On May 4, the
famous U.S.political scientist Francis Fukuyama published the article The Wages of American Political Decay on the
website The National Interest, pointing out that the highly polarized party politics made the political checks and
balances an insurmountable obstacle to decision-making; that the pandemic, which should have been an
opportunity to put aside differences and show unity, further deepened the political polarization. Politicians viewed
the pandemic as an opportunity to seize power and partisan interests, and this came at the cost of the lives of
countless American people.
Leading to Catastrophic Consequences. The website of The New York Times reported on May 20, 2020, that
research by Columbia University of the United States showed that delays in adopting movement restrictions had
caused at least 36,000 people to die. According to the research, if the U.S. government had adopted movement
restrictions one week earlier, it could have saved 36,000 lives, and if the U.S. government had adopted movement
restrictions two weeks earlier, 83 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 could have been avoided. On May 24, The
New York Times unprecedentedly dedicated its entire front page to 1,000 U.S. COVID-19 victims. Their names,

ages, and brief descriptions were listed under the headline ""U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,"" with a
subheadline reading: ""They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us."" The website of the Time reported on
May 20 that the delayed social-distancing measures caused 90 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the United
States, and observed that such a huge loss of life was essentially a failure of U.S. democracy.
2. Inequality within U.S. Society Being Fully Exposed during the Pandemic
In the United States, both liberal and conservative scholars agree on one basic fact that there is stark inequality
within U.S. society. The deep-seated institutional reason for such inequality is that the U.S. government and
political parties have long been manipulated by interest groups, and are unable to formulate and implement tax,
industrial, and social security policies that promote social equality. During the pandemic, the social and economic
inequality within U.S. society has been exposed and exacerbated.
The Elite Class of the United States Being Specially Treated in Coronavirus Testing. Viral infection does not
distinguish between rich and poor, but the limited testing and medical resources were not fairly allocated in the
United States. The website of The New York Times reported on March 19, 2020, that many dignitaries in the United
States somehow underwent virus testing when they had no signs of infection and when nearly every state in the
country lacked testing equipment. Uche Blackstock, an emergency medicine physician, said frustratedly, ""As a
physician, I find it upsetting that celebrities and government officials without symptoms have been able to access
testing quickly with same-day results, while I've had to ration out testing to my patients with turnaround times of
five or seven days."" This obvious injustice has made the public increasingly raise questions. When medical staff and
many patients cannot be diagnosed, whether the privileged class obtains priority testing means that the ordinary
people are deprived of testing opportunities. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an article
on March 21 and commented that when the Titanic hit the iceberg and sank, women and children were protected
and rescued first, but in the face of COVID-19, the United States has first rescued the rich and powerful groups.
The gap between rich and poor in getting the virus tests in the United States has exposed the slackness, confusion,
and injustice in its pandemic prevention and control system.
People at the Bottom of U.S.Society Facing an Increasingly Dangerous Situation. The pandemic has made the lives
of people at the bottom of U.S. society increasingly difficult, and further intensified the social polarization between
rich and poor. According to a CBS report in 2019, nearly 40 percent of Americans would struggle to cover a $400
emergency expense, and 25 percent of Americans skipped necessary medical care because they could not afford
the cost. The website of The Atlantic reported in April 2020 that low-income people in the United States would
usually delay seeing a doctor when they became ill, not because they did not want to recover, but because they had
no money at all. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, tens of millions of people in the United States are not covered
by medical insurance, when intensive care for COVID-19 costs as high as tens of thousands of dollars in the
country. ""To be or not to be"" is not just a philosophical proposition of some literary work, but a realistic choice that
the people at the bottom of U.S. society have to make. Russia Today reported on April 30 that a Gallup survey
revealed that one in seven American adults said that if they or their family members developed symptoms related
to COVID-19, they would probably give up medical treatment because they were worried that they could not afford
the costs. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, pointed out
on April 16 that the poor in the United States were ""being hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic"". He observed,
""Low-income and poor people face far higher risks from the coronavirus due to chronic neglect and discrimination,
and a muddled, corporate-driven federal response has failed them.""
High Unemployment Rates Leading the Working Class into a Crisis of Survival. According to data released by the
U.S. Department of Labor on May 28, 2020, the cumulative number of Americans applying for unemployment relief
from March 15 to May 23 has for the first time reached 40.8 million. Given the high unemployment rate brought
about by the pandemic and the long-existing structural discrimination and polarization between rich and poor, the
U.S. working class's ability to resist risks has greatly diminished. Vox News reported on April 10 that from the
catering industry and tourism to the media industry, the entire U.S. economy has felt the impact of the pandemic,
and just like the impact of other crises, the most vulnerable groups bore the brunt of the economic impact.
According to the report, during the pandemic, the people who are most vulnerable amid layoffs are those who earn
the lowest salaries, such as low-wage workers in the catering and retail industries. According to the report released
7/7/2021
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
4/8
by the National Restaurant Association on April 20, two-thirds of restaurant workers (about 8 million people) have
been dismissed or put on vacation due to the pandemic. When the U.S. government launched the Paycheck
Protection Program (PPP), which was intended to help small-and medium-sized enterprises, some large companies
with sufficient funds took advantage of the rule loopholes to acquire huge loans, but small businesses and small
shops that urgently needed loans to sustain themselves could not get the help. The above-mentioned report also
showed that at least 60 percent of employers said that the existing relief plan of the federal government could not
help them reduce layoffs. All this has revealed that the U.S. working class was the first to feel the pain of the
economic recession brought about by the pandemic, and became the victims of the U.S. government's inefficient
anti-pandemic measures.
3. Racial Discrimination Being Intensified within the United States during the Pandemic
The systemic racial discrimination is a chronic illness of U.S. society. Since 2016, white supremacy has revived and
racial discrimination has intensified in the United States. Social tensions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic,
especially the unequal allocation of limited anti-pandemic resources, have further deepened mainstream society's
discrimination against minorities, such as Asian, African, and Hispanic Americans.
Asian Americans Suffering from Stigmatization. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, pointed out on
April 1, 2020 that stereotyping of Asian Americans still happens in the United States, and when reporting on the
COVID-19 situation, some U.S. media always attach photos of Asian faces. The website of The New York Times
observed on April 16 that the COVID-19 pandemic meant isolation for Asian Americans. Since the outbreak of the
virus, Asian Americans have often been humiliated and even attacked in public places. Some U.S.politicians even
deliberately misled the public. After the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus ""COVID-
19"", senior U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, still insisted on referring to the virus as the
""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"". They also refused to correct that mistake even after being strongly criticized by
the international community. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 and April 21 that
politicians of relevant countries proactively expressed xenophobic opinions or made xenophobic implications by
deliberately replacing COVID-19 with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or
nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression. The current pandemic-related discrimination has fully
exposed the once-concealed racial prejudice. In the United States, which bills itself as the ""beacon of freedom"",
government officials blatantly incite, guide, and condone racial discrimination, which is tantamount to humiliating
the modern concept of human rights.
African and Hispanic Americans Falling Victims to Severe Racial Inequality. Racial discrimination is deeply rooted in
the history and reality of the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has put this issue underneath a magnifying
glass and tragically exposed its negative consequences. African Americans across the country are infected with and
die from COVID-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than any other group in the United States. The Michigan
Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) released a racial breakdown of the state's confirmed COVID-
19 cases and COVID-19 deaths on April 2, 2020, which showed that African Americans, who make up only 12
percent of Michigan's population, accounted for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed COVID-19 cases and 40 percent
of the state's COVID-19 deaths. National statistics released by the CDC showed that as of May 13, African
Americans accounted for 22.4 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. This percentage is
significantly higher than the African Americans'12.5 percent share of the total U.S.population. African Americans in
Kansas, Illinois, and Missouri accounted for only 5.7 percent, 14.1 percent, and 11.6 percent of the total population
of the states, respectively, but accounted for 29.7 percent, 30.3 percent, and 35.1 percent of these states' deaths
from COVID-19.Hispanic Americans also have disproportionately higher infection and fatality rates during the
pandemic. In early April, New York City released a racial breakdown of the city's deaths from COVID-19.According
to it, Hispanic Americans accounted for 34 percent of the city's fatal cases of COVID-19. The website of The New
York Times pointed out on April 14 that the fact the pandemic infected and killed African and Hispanic Americans at
disproportionately higher rates was the result of a health gap directly created by the historical inequality of wealth
and opportunities. The website of the Financial Times, a British newspaper, pointed out on May 15 that African
Americans and Hispanic Americans were more likely than whites to perform the work that was necessary for the
maintenance of social operations, making them more susceptible to poverty, diabetes, high blood pressure, and

COVID-19. The report also pointed out that this pandemic exacerbated the racial differences in the United States,
and that nothing could better display the difference in skin color in the United States than the life and death stories
in the pandemic shutdown. On May 25, George Floyd, an African-American man from Minnesota, died after a white
police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes during his arrest. This led to large-scale protests
and demonstrations across the United States, once again exposing the dissatisfaction and anger that the American
people have for the worsening racial inequality.
Frequent Racist Violence. During the pandemic, racist violence has haunted the United States, and Asian Americans
suffer from venomous personal attacks. From March 19 to April 1, 2020, alone, the U.S. nonprofit organization
""Stop AAPI Hate ""received more than 1,100 reports of hate incidents. In February 2020, a 16-year-old Asian boy in
Los Angeles was accused of being a ""virus carrier"" and viciously beaten at school. On March 14, in a supermarket in
Midland, Texas, a 19-year-old man deliberately stabbed an Asian man and his two young children with a knife on
the ground that ""they were Chinese and were spreading the novel coronavirus to others."" On April 5, an Asian
woman in Brooklyn, New York City, was attacked by a racist who spilled unidentified chemical liquid on her to
severely burn her upper body, face, and hands when she was emptying rubbish at her door. Violent incidents have
further exacerbated the social tension during the pandemic, and problems such as a divisive society, racial divide,
and the proliferation of guns have worsened. On April 15, nearly 200 U.S. foreign policy scholars and former
diplomats jointly issued a statement in USA Today, pointing out that hate crimes and violent attacks against Asian
Americans sounded the alarm for the United States, and that leaders at all levels and in all sectors should take
action to oppose racism against Asians and end hate crimes against Asian communities.
4. Vulnerable Groups in the United States Struggling to Survive during the Pandemic
The care for the survival of socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups represents the virtue of a society. It is
also a touchstone for the human rights situation in a country. During the pandemic, the features of the United
States' cruel capitalism have been fully exposed, which have forced the elderly, homeless people, and children into
a tragic situation.
The Elderly, the ""Victims"" of the Government's Ineffectiveness in Fighting the Pandemic. UN Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres has repeatedly stressed that the elderly, like young people, have the same rights to life and health
amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and no person is expendable. Unfortunately, during the epidemic in the United
States, the elderly group, which is naturally at greater risk, has been further weakened and marginalized due to
age discrimination, and the elderly's right to life has not been ensured. On March 23 and April 22,2020, Texas
Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick expressed in interviews with Fox News that he would rather die than see public
health measures damage the U.S. economy and take the risk of restarting the U.S. economy at the cost of elderly
people's lives. Ben Shapiro, the editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, which is a right-wing U.S. media outlet, declared
coldly on an interview show on April 29, ""If somebody who is 81 dies of COVID-19, that is not the same thing as
somebody who is 30 dying of COVID-19."" He also said, ""If grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, and that's
tragic and that's terrible, also the life expectancy in the United States is 80."" The website of The New York Times
reported on May 11 that at least 28,100 occupants and staff members of long-term care institutions such as
nursing homes in the United States have died of COVID-19, accounting for about one-third of COVID-19 deaths in
the United States. In these care institutions, many elderly people live in a relatively closed environment, so their
risk of death from COVID-19 infection is very high. The website of The Atlantic published two articles respectively
on March 28 and April 29, titled Ageism Is Making the Pandemic Worse and We're Literally Killing Elders Now. They
pointed out that long-existing defects in the old-age care system, such as insufficient capital investment and
staffing, caused the United States to fall behind in ensuring the rights and interests of the elderly, and that such a
situation was due to many political reasons. The website of the Washington Post observed on May 9 that the U.S.
anti-pandemic action had become a state-approved massacre that deliberately sacrificed the lives of the elderly, the
working class, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans.
The Homeless Having Nowhere to Go during the Pandemic. The website of USA Today reported on April 22, 2020,
that more than 550,000 people were homeless every night in the United States. The report also pointed out that
according to the statistics released by the Homeless Alliance, about 17 out of every 10,000 Americans have
experienced homelessness and about 33 percent of them are families with children. Many of the homeless

6/8
Americans are elderly people and disabled people. Given their originally poor physical health and bad living and
hygienic conditions, they are susceptible to the virus. During the epidemic, the homeless who are living on the
streets are deported and forced to live in temporary shelters for isolation. The website of Reuters reported on April
23 that the crowded shelters made it impossible for the homeless who lived there to maintain social distance, which
made it easier for the virus to spread. As of April 20, 43 homeless people living in New York City's shelters had died
from infection of COVID-19, and 617 tested positive for COVID-19.The website of The New York Times reported on
April 13 that the shelters for the homeless had become a delayed-action bomb of a virus outbreak in New York City,
where more than 17,000 people lived and slept almost side by side in centralized shelters. The website of Nature
journal reported on May 7 that when researchers began conducting virus testing on homeless people in the United
States, they found that the situation there had gotten out of control. The website of the Boston Globe reported on
May 4 that 596 homeless people in Boston had been diagnosed with COVID-19, accounting for one-third of the
confirmed cases in the region.
The website of the Los Angeles Times reported on May 14 that research showed that due to the impact of the
pandemic, the number of homeless people in the United States might surge by as much as 45 percent within a
year, further exacerbating the public health crisis.
Worrisome Situation of Poor Children and Immigrant Children. The United States has not yet ratified the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is one of the core international human rights conventions. In
recent years, child poverty and abuse has remained a grave problem in the United States. This problem has been
exacerbated by the pandemic. Forbes News reported on May 7, 2020 that a survey showed a large number of
American children were facing hunger during the pandemic. As of the end of April, more than one-fifth of American
households had been facing food crises, and two-fifths of American households with children under 12 years of age
have been facing such crises. Forbes News reported on May 9 that the number of child exploitation reports in the
United States surged during the pandemic. The National Center for Missing &Exploited Children received 4.2 million
reports in April, an increase of 2 million from March 2020 and an increase of nearly 3 million from April 2019. Apart
from that, a more worrisome fact is that a large number of unaccompanied immigrant children are still being held in
detention centers in the United States. They are currently in an extremely dangerous situation during the
pandemic. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights of migrants Felipe Gonzalez Morales and other
UN human rights experts issued a joint statement on April 27, requesting the U.S. government to transfer
immigrants from overcrowded and insanitary detention centers. On May 29, 15 experts of the Special Procedures of
United Nations Human Rights Council issued a joint statement urging the United States to take more measures to
prevent virus outbreaks in the detention centers. The website of the United Nations reported on May 21 that since
March, the U.S. government had repatriated at least 1,000 unaccompanied immigrant children to Central and South
America regardless of the risk of the pandemic. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) criticized this move,
for it would expose the children to greater danger.
5. Relevant Behaviors of the U.S. Government Seriously Violating the Spirit of International Human Rights Law
When the citizens' right to life and health is severely threatened by the spreading pandemic, the U.S. government,
instead of focusing on controlling the pandemic, wields a hegemonic stick and fans the flames of trouble
everywhere, trying to divert attention and shirk responsibility. Its behaviors have seriously undermined the
international community's concerted efforts to control the pandemic.
Ineffective Anti-pandemic Efforts Failing the National Duty of Ensuring the Citizens' Right to Life. The International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) stipulates that every human being has the inherent right to life, and
countries are obliged to take proactive measures to guarantee their citizens' right to life. As a party to the
convention, the U.S.government, however, has not given priority to its citizens' right to life and health during the
pandemic. Instead, it has been prioritizing the political campaign at home and the political drive to suppress China
abroad, rather than safeguarding the lives and safety of its citizens. Given this, it has missed the best chance to
curb the spread of the virus, and caused a grave human rights disaster in which about 2 million people have been
infected with COVID-19, and more than 110,000 have died from the virus. Clearly, the U.S. government has failed
to fulfill its due national obligations to protect its people's lives from the threat of epidemics. The website of The
Independent, a British newspaper, commented on April 10, 2020, that the United States, an active advocator for
7/7/2021

7/8
human rights, ignored its own human rights obligations and blatantly overlooked its citizens' lives. The website of
the Huffington Post reported on May 6 that after making a rigorous assessment of the U.S. government's poor
performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Yale University epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves directly pointed out
that this was getting awfully close to genocide by default.
Maliciously Stigmatizing China in Violation of the Principles of Equality and Non-discrimination. The principles of
equality and nondiscrimination are the core norms of international human rights laws and are confirmed by a series
of international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since the outbreak
of the virus, high-ranking U.S. government officials have violently disregarded human conscience and ethical
bottom lines. To maintain the U.S. hegemony, these officials have politicized the pandemic and constantly
stigmatized China by referring to the virus as the ""Wuhan Virus"" or the ""China virus"".When the scientific community
came to the conclusion that the exact source of the virus was from nature, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
still repeatedly claimed that the virus came from some lab in Wuhan according to some ""intelligence reports"" he
read. These politicians' behaviors have clearly violated World Health Organization Best Practices for the Naming of
New Human Infectious Diseases, which was jointly issued by the World Health Organization, the World Organization
for Animal Health, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2015. The way they refer to
the virus goes against the World Health Organization's suggestion for the official name of the novel coronavirus
disease. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia
and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 that some U.S. government officials refused to
use the internationally-recognized name of the virus and deliberately replaced it with other names that linked this
particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression that came
from and would give rise to racism, xenophobia, stigmatization, and exclusion of certain groups, and violence
against certain groups. She held that such behaviors were unforgivable and incompatible with the obligations
stipulated by the international human rights laws.
Suspending the Payment of WHO Membership Fees Impeding the Joint Anti-Pandemic Efforts of the International
Community. In order to shirk its responsibility for its disastrous anti-pandemic measures, the U.S. government tried
to scapegoat the World Health Organization by fabricating false charges against the organization and threatening to
stop paying its membership fees. On April 14, 2020, the U.S. government announced its suspension of paying dues
to the WHO, which was unanimously criticized by the international community. UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres issued a statement on April 14 stating that when the world was fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, it was
inappropriate to reduce the resources required by the WHO or any other humanitarian organization for operations.
The President of the American Medical Association, Patrice Harris, issued a statement on April 15 stating that
combating the pandemic required international cooperation and that the suspension of financial support to the WHO
at this critical moment is a dangerous step in the wrong direction. Josep Borrell, the European Union High
Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed on April 15 that at this time, there was no reason
to justify such an action. On April 15, the website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an editorial and
commented that when the world desperately needed to jointly overcome this threat that the world had never
experienced before, the suspension of the WHO dues by the U.S.government was an act that lacked morality and
disrupted the international order, and was a horrible betrayal to global solidarity. German Foreign Minister Heiko
Maas said on April 16 that the WHO was the mainstay of the global fight against the pandemic, and the suspension
of the WHO dues by the United States at this time ""would be nothing other than throwing the pilot out of the plane
in mid-flight"".Under such circumstances, the U.S.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once again attacked the WHO on
April 22, threatening to permanently suspend the payment of dues. On May 29, the president of the United States
announced the suspension of relations with the WHO.
Unilateral Sanctions Violating the Spirit of Humanitarianism and the Principle of International Cooperation.
International cooperation is the cornerstone of the existence and operation of the international community. It is an
important principle for ensuring the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms across the globe. It
is also a national obligation stipulated by international instruments, such as the Charter of the United Nations. At
this critical moment when the deadly pandemic spreads globally and threatens human life, health, and well-being,
all countries should work together to respond to the pandemic and maintain global public health security.
Nevertheless, during this pandemic, the U.S. government has still imposed sanctions on countries such as Iran,
Cuba, and Venezuela, which made it difficult for the sanctioned countries to obtain needed anti-pandemic medical

"

Activists are encouraging people to post photos of themselves wearing masks on social media to show solidarity with victims who have been attacked in hate crimes.
Congress and activists have cited racist hate crimes against Asian-Americans who were wearing masks to protect them from COVID-19.
The CDC last week reversed course on government guidance about wearing masks during the pandemic by urging Americans to wear them.
""I used to refuse wearing masks when I was younger to avoid being made fun of,"" says Michelle Hanabusa, founder of UPRISERS, a Los Angeles-based clothing brand, which
sells masks emblazoned with the hashtag on her website. The hashtag ""is meant to combat any of these stigmas.""
Activists against COVID-19-related hate crimes are leading a social media campaign using images of people in masks to fight back against attacks on Asian-Americans, which
Congress and the FBI say are increasing.
Last week the Centers for Disease Control asked Americans to wear non-medical masks in public, which the activists see as an opportunity to spread their message that racist
attacks related to the virus must stop. The US surgeon general previously urged Americans not to buy or wear masks. Activists say masks have become a powerful symbol of
the controversy and conflicts involving the virus.
The activists are encouraging people to post photos of themselves in masks with the hashtag #HateIsAVirus to illustrate that wearing masks – and the virus itself – are in no
way specific to any race, region, or nation.
—HATEISAVIRUS (@hateisavirus_) March 29, 2020
Other hashtags, including #WashTheHate, #RacismIsAVirus, #IAmNotCOVID19, have protested hate crimes and hate speech, and condemned President Donald Trump's use of
the phrase ""Chinese virus."" The president said last week that while the CDC is urging people to wear masks, he chooses not to.
Michelle Hanabusa, founder of UPRISERS, a Los Angeles-based clothing brand, sells masks emblazoned with the hashtag on her website. ""I used to refuse wearing masks when
I was younger to avoid being made fun of,"" she says. The hashtag ""is meant to combat any of these stigmas.""
Indeed, it appears that the mask has become something of a symbol.
""From the data available in public reporting, as well as ongoing studies and online conversation that we've been aggregating on racismiscontagious.com, it is clear that the mask
has been a polarizing object,"" says Selina Guo, a New York advertising director at the firm ADMERASIA, which runs the website in collaboration with several non-profits. Masks
were the top target sparking attacks after race and ethnicity, according to data on the site. ""We are anxious to see if this announcement ultimately flattens or exacerbates these
instances.""
Racist attacks on the rise
Last week the FBI warned law enforcement across the country that hate crimes against Asians may increase due to the virus, according to a bureau report obtained by ABC
News, ""The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations,"" ABC
quoted the report as saying.
Two-dozen federal lawmakers from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), wrote a letter urging Congress ""to help us prevent hysteria, ignorant attacks, and
racist assaults that have been fueled by misinformation pertaining to the 2019 novel coronavirus."" The letter cited an attack in February, on an Asian woman wearing a
protective mask who was kicked and punched in a New York subway station.
Racist attacks on Asian-Americans have surged to about 100 per day, according to Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California, leader of the caucus, who said on MSNBC last week
that some victims were ""assaulted just for wearing a face mask.""
Organizers of the social media campaign aimed at stopping the attacks say the recent news events related to masks and attacks are a chance to communicate their cause.

Nepal, April 24 -- On Wednesday, April 15, Milan Limbu was playing video games in his room when he heard a loud explosion. At first, he thought it was the sound of
fireworks. But it was 11 pm in the otherwise quiet neighbourhood of Maidstone, an English town south-east of London. Limbu looked out the window to find his parents' car
on fire.
The police and fire department were called, and the conclusion was arson-the car had deliberately been set on fire. For Limbu, the son of Ram Kumar Limbu, a former British
Gurkha, it was an attack that he'd never experienced before in Maidstone, a small town that is known as a Gurkha enclave in England.
""It was an attack on my family, on our house,"" said Limbu.
But that wasn't to be the only attack on the Gurkha community that night. Barely an hour after Limbu's parents' car was set afire, another car belonging to Basanta Maden,
also a former British Gurkha and Limbu's neighbour, was burned.
Ratna Limbu, Milan's uncle, believes that the arson attacks were racially motivated.
""We have been deeply saddened and, at the same time, badly shaken up by these incidents,"" he said. ""I am afraid that my family might also be the target of a hate crime.""
The arson attacks on Limbu and Maden are by no means isolated incidents. In recent days, physical and verbal attacks against the Nepali community in England are becoming
much more common. Many believe that this has to do with the Covid-19 pandemic, which has sparked racism and anti-Asian xenophobia across the world.
Last month, when Roshan Gurung was walking on the street of Bristol, a man directed an angry rant at him from his car.
""It was the first time that I faced racism. I get chills even remembering the incident. The man yelled at me, saying at what price I was selling bats and then he sarcastically
congratulated me for spreading Covid-19,"" said Gurung.
On March 18, Haushala Thapa Zimba reported being the target of a comment by a passerby who accused her of having brought the ""virus"" to England.
""Until then, I had never been harassed for my race. So, when racist slurs were used against me, I felt shocked, angry and unsafe at the same time. I felt like people were
judging me based on my appearance,"" said Zimba.
As the number of Covid-19 cases rises, fear and anxiety over the potentially deadly disease have led individuals and groups to scapegoat Chinese people and those of Asian
descent. Throughout history, whenever there is a major incident with global or regional implications, people have sought to allocate blame to certain vulnerable populations in
order to calm their own fears.
For instance, during the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009, Mexicans and many Latinos were scapegoated whereas people of African descent were scrutinised during the 2014
Ebola outbreak.
There is evidence that wherever outbreaks take place, people scapegoat groups that are already marginalised and treated as ""the other.""
Narayani Devkota, a lecturer at Tribhuvan University's Sociology Department, said that the Nepali community in the UK has become a target of racist crimes amidst the
outbreak of Covid-19 because they have long been regarded as ""the other"" in the predominantly white society.
""Nepalis in the UK are racially distinct immigrants who are in the minority. They are also regarded as comparatively poor in socio-economic status. These reasons may have
further triggered the racially motivated act against them during the outbreak,"" said Devkota.
According to Neelima Limbu, a resident of Dover, harassment against the Nepali community existed even before the outbreak of Covid-19.
""I work in a supermarket and I have faced comments such as 'go back to your country' several times, even before the corona outbreak,"" said Limbu. ""Most of the time, these
attackers are a small disruptive group of individuals, such as uneducated people and kids.""
Neelima, however, said misinformation regarding Covid-19 and its association with a certain ethnicity has only contributed to the hostility towards Nepalis.

Immigration to the US often suffers when the country faces a disaster, whether it is a disaster of war, economy or public health.
The novel coronavirus pandemic has already prompted the Trump administration to close borders and turn away asylum-seekers without sufficient processing. On Monday,
President Donald Trump tweeted that he would suspend immigration to the US.
That statement was later clarified as a plan to temporarily halt giving foreigners permanent residence in the United States, which Trump claims will protect American workers
during the coronavirus pandemic. The order, which is undergoing a legal review, would suspended the process to grant foreigners ""green cards"" for permanent residence, but a
White House official who requested anonymity to discuss the process suggested the timeline for the order could be pushed back.
Critics say the president's announcement is a move to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis to implement a long-sought policy goal ahead of this year's presidential election.
Business groups expressed opposition to Trump's plan on Tuesday, arguing it would only further depress the economy.
Many key details of Trump's planned executive order are still unknown, but crucially, while the order could block many people applying for permanent residence outside the
United States, it is not clear how it would impact people already in the country seeking to become permanent residents. Trump said the order initially would last for 60 days and
could be renewed for the same period or longer, and that a second immigration-focused order was under consideration.
The Washington-based Migration Policy Institute estimates that Trump's green card effort could prevent between 114,000 and 660,000 people securing permanent residence - if
left in place for a year.
Erika Lee is an immigration history professor at the University of Minnesota and the author of ""America for Americans: A History of Xenophobia in the United States."" The
World's Marco Werman spoke with Lee about how the US has responded with changes to immigration policy and increased xenophobia during times of war, economic hardship
and disease throughout history.
Related: For centuries, migrants have been said to pose public health risks. They don't.
Marco Werman: Let's take a historical look at this. Your book, ""America for Americans"" is about the US' long history with xenophobia. You've seen the
intersection of disease or other crises and nativism before in the past century. How does this current administration's response to this pandemic compare to
another public health emergency, whether it's the 1918 flu or the response to the collapse of hygiene in New Orleans after Katrina?
Erika Lee: The 1918 flu pandemic is actually really fascinating to compare it to what's happening today. So first, we have to understand that, of course, during World War I,
immigration was effectively halted due to the war and the end of passenger steamship travel. But even during the flu pandemic, in which the US lost 650,000 lives, the country
didn't try to limit immigration. In fact, we still let in over 110,000 immigrants. And the Bureau of Immigration touted its kind treatment of sick immigrants.
So, take the immigration detention center in New Orleans, for example. There was an outbreak of flu epidemic there. There were 30 immigrants who were sick. But the Bureau
of Immigration published a report in which it touted how it took care of its employees by requiring face masks, it sanitized the facilities, it put into place social distancing or
isolation. And because of that treatment of immigrants, no lives were lost.
Related: Public charge rule has history of 'racial exclusion'
Erika, the stories right now of hate directed at Asians, Asian Americans - we're hearing stories of acid attacks. So personally, what has it's been like for you as
someone whose grandfather arrived in this country during the Chinese Exclusion Act?
You know, I remember hearing stories of my parents insisting that during World War II, into the 1950s and '60s, they still felt the sting, not only of Chinese exclusion, but also
just anti-Asian racism, in general. Obviously, Japanese American incarceration, as well. And their philosophy was, ""We need to show that we're Americans first and Chinese
second."" So for them, there was this sense of sort of ultra assimilation. ""We need to prove that we're loyal. We need to prove that we're patriots. We need to prove that we're
assimilated.""

The coronavirus pandemic has already shown that times of crisis bring out the best in our fellow citizens. We experience it every day as we marvel at the heroic actions of first-
responders, health care professionals, charities and community volunteers. Sadly, however, crises can also bring out the worst. That is why we need to remain vigilant in the
fight against hate, conspiracies and scapegoating. Law enforcement, civil rights organizations and media outlets are reporting on increased hate crimes against Asian-
Americans, due to the completely mistaken and wrongheaded belief that they have culpability for the pandemic.
While it's clear the Chinese government covered up key information about the coronavirus' initial outbreak in Wuhan, we need to remember that it is the people of China who
were the first victims of this policy. Now Asian-Americans of all backgrounds are becoming the targets of harassment, insults and violence.
A man in Texas faces attempted murder charges for attacking an Asian-American family of four in a supermarket and stabbing three of them, including a two-year-old and a six-
year-old child, claiming they were responsible for spreading coronavirus.
The website Stop AAPI Hate has fielded over 1,500 recent hate incident reports including 11 in New York City. Such scapegoating is particularly outrageous when one considers
that 17% of doctors and 10% of nurses in our country εεε those putting their lives on the line to help pro tect our families and neighbors εεεare Asian-American.
Jews are all too familiar with disease-related scapegoating throughout history.
During the Black Plague in Europe in the Middle Ages, Jewish people were scapegoated and killed mercilessly by fanatics across the continent. Over 600 entire Jewish
communities were destroyed. Many killers claimed that Jews had poisoned wells to spread the plague, or that the plague was a Jewish plot to decimate Christian communities.
Never mind that Jews died in horrific numbers during the plague as well. Sadly, modern anti-Semites are right now on the internet weaving similarly insane conspiracy theories
blaming Jews for spreading coronavirus.
Indeed, the Simon Wiesenthal Center just turned over a list of some 45 channels on social media platforms like Telegram and Gab to United States Attorney General William
Barr and Homeland Security that promote lurid conspiracy theories linking Jews to the pandemic and urging those suffering from CoronaVirus to go to synagogues and mosques
to spread the deadly virus.
None of us is immune from accidentally falling prey to misinformation that can hurt our neighbors. One of us εεε Councilman Joshi εεε posted a thoughtless tweet that
potentially could have hurt my Jewish neighbors. As an Indo-American I should have known better. I apologized and toured the nearby Jewish community and learned first-hand
of their commitment and struggle to help fight the pandemic.
Working together with all people of good faith we will hopefully soon be beneficiaries of a vaccine to stop the pandemic. But no one has yet come up with a cure for history's
oldest virus εεε hate.
We all must reject any and all efforts seeking to conflate justified anger at the Chinese communist government with anger towards Asian-Americans. This is the height of
hypocrisy, and insulting to the many Chinese-Americans who fled to our country specifically to escape repression by the Chinese government. We should never blame
immigrants from any country for the actions of a foreign government that they have no control over.
What can we do to fight hate and protect our neighbors? First, be sure to report any incidents to the proper authorities. Please also submit anti-Asian American incidents in New
Jersey to the office of Councilman Sam Joshi and to national Stop AAPI Hate website. If you experience an anti-Semitic incident or see anti-Semitic remarks on social media
please contact ireport@wiesenthal.com.
Also, continue to check in on your neighbors εεε regardless of their background. The pandemic has taught us that we are all in the same boat. Let's be sure we don't allow the
bigots to exploit this crisis. By showing we care about each other, we can emerge from the pandemic stronger and more united than ever.

Living amid a pandemic is enough to make all of us afraid. No one today, at least no one with any sense, can enjoy freedom from fear. Some of us have more reason to fear
than others. Think of our doctors and nurses, our sick and elderly. Think of our fellow citizens who have lost their livelihoods. Then think about those who have become visible
scapegoats for our predicament.
On Wednesday, a group of prominent Chinese Australians issued an open letter warning that national unity was at risk. According to the group, which includes former Australian
of the Year John Yu, writer Benjamin Law and chef Adam Liaw, ""the recent rise in anti-Chinese sentiment is driving a marked escalation in racial abuse against Asian
Australians"".
There is growing evidence of a deterioration. The Australian Human Rights Commission has recorded a spike in racial discrimination complaints. There are reports across the
country of Asian Australians experiencing verbal abuse, evictions, even physical attacks. In Sydney this week, a man was charged with intimidation after cracking a whip and
threatening people outside the Chinese consulate.
Minorities rarely fare well during pandemics. In the current case, Chinese and Asian Australians were almost certain to be targeted for backlash. For the virus did originate in
Wuhan, China. The Chinese government did fail to respond quickly enough to the outbreak.
But these aren't reasons to be vilifying or targeting anyone who looks Chinese. And they're far from good reasons to be calling COVID-19 ""the Chinese virus"", as Donald Trump
and others have christened it. Viruses don't have ethnic or racial characteristics. So far, mainstream Australian political leaders have avoided Trumpian excess. But why, then,
has anti-Chinese sentiment appeared nonetheless to grow?
Discrimination always arises from existing anxieties and prejudices. And for some time now, anti-Chinese sentiment has been brewing. Often running alongside concerns about
Chinese Communist Party ""fifth columnists"", there is unease about Chinese buyers outbidding locals at home auctions, or acquiring agricultural land.
It's fertile ground for anger to sprout. Consider the outrage over the panic hoarding of goods, including by supposed busloads of shopping ""tourists"" encroaching on
supermarkets in regional towns. The absence of evidence hasn't prevented the wide circulation of stories about Asian tourist buses launching sinister raids. Perhaps it's because
they fit neatly into existing narratives, built on suspicion.
Things could get worse. The likelihood of further economic pain and prolonged physical isolation may see prejudice and anger fester.
Yet racism poses a threat to the solidarity needed right now. As the American political scientist Francis Fukuyama has highlighted, the countries faring best in dealing with the
coronavirus are characterised by trust. What matters is ""whether citizens trust their leaders, and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state"".
Case in point: the US, where the human disaster is measured in deaths rapidly mounting by the thousands. The Trump administration has succeeded only in sowing a distrust of
government usually found in failed states.
The task at hand isn't just about meeting the immediate health and economic threat of the pandemic. It's also about ensuring we come out of the crisis the right way.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has to date spoken about our society and economy going into a period of hibernation. And in his speech to Parliament on Wednesday, he spoke
about ""defending and protecting Australia's national sovereignty"".
However, will we ever return to what we knew as normal? In politics, a Coalition government is acting (at least temporarily) like a social democratic one, having introduced a
massive stimulus package. Beyond politics, in work and in society, many of the old rules may no longer exist.
It's still too soon to know, but our pandemic response may end up less of a hibernation, and more of a transition. History shows that crises are often moments for transforming
society. Rather than merely a challenge of national defence, as the PM suggests, this pandemic also presents one of reconstruction.
Having pulled up the drawbridge for now, there's a risk of our national sentiment becoming too insular, too defensive. What's needed isn't so much a rallying cry of sovereignty,
but of nation-building. If we need trust, it's not only trust in government, it's trust among citizens.
The kind of nation we rebuild - the kind of social contract we re-enact - will be determined not just by government, but by us as citizens. In these extraordinary times, almost all
our lives have grown more ordinary. The little things, the gestures and exchanges between us, have taken on new meaning. All the more reason to stamp out the racism, often

The COVID-19 pandemic has been stressful for communities across the globe. It has perpetrated a level of anxiety in all populations,
which has led to stigma towards certain people – especially Asian Americans in the US. The current outbreak has provoked stigma in
Nepal as well. Health care workers, COVID-19 patients or suspects and people who have returned home from abroad are having to
face these stigmas.
A few days back, an adult male presented himself in our fever clinic at the Charikot Primary Health Care Centre with a history of
sore throat and cough. He had returned from South Korea a month back and had lived in self-quarantine for 21 days. None of his
family members showed any symptoms. He and his family members were, however, facing persistent discrimination from
neighbours.
He came to us after someone posted his name and address in the social media, accusing him of possibly spreading the disease in his
village. Thus, he demanded a test for COVID-19 to prove he did not have the virus.
The very next day, a young female who had returned from Dubai 11 days back came to us demanding a test. She had absolutely no
symptoms. But she came to our hospital after walking more than four hours because her community had pressured her to get the
test.
Social stigma in the context of health is the negative association between a person or group of people who share certain
characteristics and a specific disease. Mental disorders, AIDS, venereal diseases, leprosy and the like are diseases that are
stigmatised in our community – by limiting social participation. Stigma is not limited to the person suffering from the disease but
extends to one’s family members, too.
Stigma is associated with the COVID- 19 outbreak because of its highly contagious nature and relatively high mortality.
Stigmatisation has huge impact on a patient as well as the quality of care he or she receives from the health institutions. The patient
might keep away from seeking help for the illness for fear of discrimination. In Dolakha, there are lots of migrant workers from
India, and yet they are not seeking care at the nearby health centres because of this fear. Also, there are cases where after a recent
foreign country visit, people hide themselves from the community so that their family member need not go through the negative
consequences.

Coronavirus-related discrimination in New York City is on the rise, particularly against Asian-Americans, prompting the city to establish a new response team to handle the
complaints.
The city's Commission on Human Rights said since Feb. 1 it has received 248 complaints of discrimination spurred by fears over Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel
coronavirus . The majority of complaints were made in March and April, and about 42% have been specifically anti-Asian.
The influx of calls prompted the commission to form a task force in early April to address the incidents, including discrimination in housing or employment based on race, age,
immigration status or disability. Several of the calls were from disabled or immunocompromised tenants whose landlords or co-op boards had restricted deliveries of groceries or
other purchases.
""The response team came together because we saw that we had so many inquiries coming in after this pandemic started,"" said Sapna Raj, deputy commissioner of the
commission's law enforcement bureau. ""We realized we needed to respond rapidly to unique issues that New Yorkers were facing.""
The commission acts as a city watchdog and enforces human-rights laws. It can seek civil penalties against an individual or business accused of discrimination.
Between Feb. 1 and April 16, the commission received 105 reports of anti-Asian incidents, compared with five in the same time frame last year. Out of the discrimination
reports, 91 were for harassment, five were for housing and nine were for public accommodation.
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have risen this year as well, while the number of overall crimes in New York City has fallen. Between March 7 and April 2, the New York
Police Department has received reports of 11 hate crimes related to the disease and made seven arrests.
Following an inquiry, the human-rights commission may advise on a caller's rights and intervene, or open up a longer-term investigation. If the commission determines the
complaint to be a hate crime, the case is passed along to the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force.
As the original coronavirus outbreak in China morphed into a global pandemic , Chinese-Americans and others of Asian descent have reported more cases of racism and
discrimination. However, broader data on the discrimination is sparse.
Manjusha P. Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, said members of Asian communities may be reluctant to report incidents because of
immigration and policing concerns.
She said the organization was alerted to its first coronavirus-related discrimination issue in early February, after a middle-school child in Los Angeles was accused by another
student of having the disease. An online form for reporting similar cases that launched on March 19 has garnered about 1,500 responses across 46 states, most notably in
California and New York, ranging from refusal of service to physical attacks.
""Even though the numbers are small overall, I think it's an indication of what we're seeing across the country,"" Ms. Kulkarni said. ""All those efforts are important to get a better
understanding of the problem.""
Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a nonprofit that provides social services to Asian-Americans, said he started noticing the fallout as early as
January, in the form of snide remarks and the avoidance of Chinese businesses.
Mr. Ho said new policies and enforcement of legislation can help protect against discrimination in housing and jobs, but an increase in harassment requires more social outreach.
""I have staff members who have been spit on by people, people have yelled at them or made comments on the subway,"" he said. ""People have thrown everything from pieces of
paper to their leftover lunch.""

Guwahati, April 2 -- The Covid-19 is set to dominate the future debates on globalization, but its impact is not
merely limited to the field of health or international relations. Donald Trump, the President of the United States,
called the Covid-19 as the 'Chinese virus' or 'China virus' on multiple occasions. In his defence, he had pointed out
that the term was not racist at all as the virus was said to have originated in that country. However, he changed his
position and tweeted that the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US was not the fault of the Asian-Americans.
Partly responsible for this change of heart may be the fact that the Asian-Americans have been a target of growing
number of racist and xenophobic attacks related with the virus.
However, closer home, disturbing facts related to an 'old virus' but having mutated to a new form are doing the
rounds in many parts of India now. This pertains to a spike in racist taunts/attacks against the northeasterners with
reference to the novel coronavirus. One would like to call it Racism-19 for the sake of brevity.
There are instances galore of this latest trend which is raising its ugly head. The most infamous being how a
Manipuri girl was spat on and called 'corona' while she stepped out to pick up essentials in North Delhi. Fortunately
in this case, the police acted promptly and arrested the culprit.
In Kolkata, 'Go corona go' chants could be heard in a particular locality. No, this wasn't any community confidence
building exercise to tide over the dark clouds hanging over all of us due to the pandemic, but a mob that had
gathered outside the flat where three women from Nagaland resided. The crowd was adamant that the women ' so-
called 'carriers of the virus' ' should immediately leave their house as well as the locality. When the incidents like
these occur, it is difficult to understand whether the crowd was driven by genuine fear of Covid-19 or outright
racism. As the videos doing the rounds on social media show, the crowd was not maintaining any social distancing,
and hence the possibility of the former appears low.

Dakota Holmes says she was walking her dog, Kato, through Gray's Park on Vancouver's  Eastside at about 8.30pm on  Friday when she sneezed.
She said she had just passed a man, who wheeled around and began berating her about  Covid-19, yelling at her to ""go back to China"". As the abuse  escalated - ""very negative
comments [about] the coronavirus … go home, you don't belong here"" - the man punched her in the head twice, knocking her to the ground.
Holmes, 27, is an indigenous Canadian.
""I've been in situations like this before, being indigenous,"" Holmes said. ""I try not to get  involved. I try not to say anything back … I think the only thing I said was 'I'm not
Asian, I'm indigenous, I'm from here, I've been here my whole life'.""
Holmes' experience is not unique.
In Montreal, Inuit  woman Sue Simigak said she was abused on the city's subway on April 4 by a man who similarly mistook her for being Chinese and told her to ""get out of my
own country"". She  posted pictures on Facebook showing a man giving her the  finger from a subway  platform.
Anti-racism activist Fo Niemi said indigenous people in  Canada, particularly the Inuit, were often mistaken for Asians ""due to their physical features"".
The cases of Holmes and  Simigak showed how racism could spread amid the pandemic, said Niemi, co-founder and exe cutive director of the Montreal-based Centre for Research
Action on Race Relations.
""Rising incidents and reports of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia can spread to other groups in Canada who look Asian,  ranging from Inuit people to Latin Americans,"" Niemi
said.
Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, issued a statement in response to the attack on Holmes, who works at the organisation.
It said the union was  ""disgusted"" by the incident and offered ""sympathy and solidarity to Asian communities who have borne the brunt of Covid-19  related racism"".
Holmes' case was being  handled by the Vancouver  Police  Department's hate crimes  investigators, spokesman  Sergeant Aaron Roed said.
""Our initial investigation shows that a person was assaulted and this may have been related to race … the victim did have  minor physical injuries and did not need medical
treatment the night of the incident,"" Roed said.
No arrests have been made, and police were seeking witnesses to the incident, Roed said. Holmes said her attacker was a Caucasian man, about 180cm tall and  weighing about
90kg,  wearing a hat and a dark jumper.
She said the man had passed her from the opposite direction and was about two metres behind her when she sneezed because of her seasonal allergies. He immediately started
shouting abuse.
""When I turned around to face him, he started coming at me,  yelling in my face and then he punched me, in the jaw, and then above my eye, my temple area,"" she said.
Holmes said she fell to the ground, but felt she was saved from worse by Kato, a 45kg Dogo Argentino that Holmes adopted three years ago. Kato started  biting at the man's
ankles.
The man responded by  threatening to have authorities confiscate Kato because the dog was ""being aggressive"". With Kato straining at the end of his leash, the man eventually
ran off.
Holmes returned to her nearby home and called her father, Don Bain - a special adviser to British Columbia Premier John Horgan - who calmed her down. An hour later she
called the police and met them back at the park.
Niemi said a wave of anti-Asian racism linked to the coronavirus had caught many places unprepared.

This week's question comes from Elena in Dolores Heights, San Francisco, who asks: My child's day care had to
close for a month due to COVID-19 exposure. I took time off from work to take care of my 4-year-old. When I
returned to work, my coworkers began treating me differently. They know about what happened at my child's
day care. When I walk in a room, I see them whispering to each other and/or they leave the room altogether, as
if to avoid me. One coworker specifically asked me if I had the ""kung-flu."" I am Asian American and I was
offended by this comment. Another coworker said that it wasn't fair that I got to take a ""month-long vacation,"" I
verbally complained to my manager about the racist remark and being treated differently by my coworkers and
she assured me that she would take care of it.
A couple of weeks later, my manager told me that I was being transferred to the graveyard shift. My manager
knows that I cannot work that shift because I have a young child I told her that this was not fair and that I
thought I was being retaliated against for taking time off because of a COVID-19 closure of my child's day care
and/or complaining about my coworkers'racist remarks. She denied it and said that it was a business need, and
that my options are switching to the graveyard shift or quitting. I believe she is singling me out. I have been
working for this company for two years and have always had a great relationship with my manager prior to my
complaints. I don't know what to do. What are my rights?
Dear Elena: I'm so sorry that this is happening to you in the midst of what already is such a difficult year. The

Had he stuck to his initial plans, Mr Darius Cheong, 21, would be heading to the University of Virginia to study business management in August this year.
He was convinced that four years in the United States would give him global exposure. But then the pandemic hit and reports of racist attacks on Asians in the US also worried
him.
Mr Cheong has decided to alter course. Instead of going to the US, he has opted to pursue his degree studies at the Singapore Management University, which is known for its
American style of teaching.
Similarly, Raffles Institution alumna Valerie Lu, 19, was all set to start her degree studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art in the US this September. But after factoring in
the uncertainties and high cost of studying overseas, she applied to and secured a place at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) instead.
Mr Cheong and Miss Lu are among the Singaporeans who are giving up on their overseas study plans in favour of local universities.
Each of the six local universities received between 19 and 550 applications during the second admissions exercise held last month to cater to late applicants, they told The
Sunday Times.
These included applicants who switched from overseas to local universities.
Another group of applicants were polytechnic diploma holders who had previously thought of going to work but were now opting to study because of the weak job market.
While the universities are still in the process of deciding how many applicants to take in, the National University of Singapore confirmed it had received 450 applications during
the second admissions exercise and SUTD said it had received 550.
Students like Ms Lu and Mr Cheong are the lucky ones, though, with a definite path to pursue.
The Covid-19 outbreak has left many Singaporean students, with plans to study overseas, unsure of what the future holds.
COST CONSIDERATIONS
If teaching is still online, why would I go back? Sydney is not a cheap city to live in.
MS CELINE CHOO, 19, who started her studies at UNSW in February but had to return to Singapore 11/2 months later.
PURSUING ASPIRATIONS
It has been my dream since I was 10 and I have been working hard to get into a university like Stanford. I hope governments
deal with the pandemic and it will still be possible for young people like me to pursue our aspirations.
MS ALICIA CHEONG, 18, who still hopes to study overseas.
Take Ms Stella Cheong, 22. A local university has offered her a place. But she still prefers to head to San Francisco to study business studies there.
The situation has left her undecided. She calls it ""being in a coronavirus limbo"" and is prepared to defer her studies for up to six months.
Singapore Polytechnic alumnus Garreth Benjamin, 24, who headed back to Singapore in March, has also decided to put off the last semester of his commerce degree at the
University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney till next year.
He had earlier planned to take up a three-month internship at an accounting firm in Sydney, but now realises that such positions will be hard to come by, so he is prepared to
wait.
