At China King last month, the phone rarely rang.
“One day, there was nothing,"" said owner Doris Huang of a day without a single order. “Nobody at all. I have never seen it so quiet.""
The rent for her modest Chinatown restaurant is past due. One employee remains on the payroll, and Huang's small pool of savings ebbs lower each day. The money China King
needs to stay afloat is simply not there, and there's no sign profits will start pouring in soon. So Huang closed her beloved 25-year-old restaurant last week — at least
temporarily — after sparring with the decision for a while.
Eateries across the state, like China King, are suffering under necessary distancing guidelines and barely staving off financial ruin during COVID-19. In response, restaurateurs
have implemented cost-cutting measures, including truncated hours, shortened menus, and widespread layoffs.
But a slew of recent restaurant closures in Chinatown signals an especially dire financial future for the historic neighborhood.
“This is going to be a long haul for everyone,"" said Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu. “But there is especially pain in the Asian-American community in Boston and across the
country.""
Decades-old institutions — Taiwan Cafe and Su Su Gourmet, for example — have boarded up their doors for the foreseeable future. Banquet halls usually enlivened by Lunar
New Year celebrations until late April are deserted. A once-bustling Beach Street is eerily quiet.
The nearly 20 Chinatown restaurants continuing business in mid-March has been reduced to a dozen or fewer, according to Boston Chinatown Tours founder Jacqueline Church.
Per a spreadsheet run by a local advocacy group, Chinatown Main Street, a number of spots are still serving through third-party delivery apps, who receive a chunk of the
revenue from each order. (The list is run by volunteers and was last updated on April 10.)
Joe Wong, a member of the Chinatown Main Street board of directors, said some places have stayed open in the hopes of using meats and vegetables that would otherwise spoil
— an even greater financial loss than their operating costs.
It's a precarious situation for a neighborhood that has long caught the eye of property owners and developers looking to take advantage of its central location.
“There's been a long fight to keep Chinatown affordable and not displace the residents and the businesses that make the community special,"" said Wu. “There has been rampant
speculation because it is so close to downtown, and the appetite for luxury development there is very high. . . . This certainly adds more stress.""
Huang's analysis of the situation was simpler.
“It's bad,"" she said. ""Very, very bad.""
Chinatown restaurateurs felt the initial financial fallout from the disease as early as February, when fears of coronavirus began to circulate. The fact that the illness originated in
China's Hubei Province scared potential customers, driving restaurant sales down by 50 percent or more.
Local officials and residents rallied patrons to come back for shumai and congee with Dim Sum Brunches and desperate pleas online. Since then, multiple restaurants boosted by
those efforts have closed, said Wu. Even China Pearl, the host of a widely attended event on Feb. 15, shuttered later that month. Its Quincy location transitioned to delivery and
then to pickup only, which it offers during a four-hour window midday.
Now the rise in anti-Asian sentiment and xenophobic attacks has only bolstered the economic downturn plaguing the restaurants.
“All the financial factors are compounded by the stirring racism,"" said Church, a longtime resident of Chinatown. “Everybody's concerned about the so-called 'Chinese Virus.' ""
Many restaurateurs have been on the hunt for small-business relief programs that could ease their spiraling financial woes. But quick deadlines, language barriers, and
documentation issues pose a litany of hurdles for Chinatown's business owners, many of whom are immigrants desperate for aid.

On Wednesday morning, a Newton South High School advanced placement Chinese class was underway on Zoom when hackers
infiltrated the group, posting “vile, hate-filled images and speech"" directed at the students, officials said.
The incident, which lasted about three minutes, was part of a phenomenon known as “Zoom-bombing,"" when a Zoom call is hacked into
by individuals who disrupt a meeting. It was also an example, school officials said, of coronavirus-related racism that has run rampant
since the beginning of the pandemic, often directed at the Asian community.
Joel Stembridge, Newton South's principal, wrote to the school community Thursday morning, calling the episode “clearly racist,
hateful, and horrible.""
“This was a traumatic experience for our teacher and students, and we will continue to offer support to everyone involved,"" Stembridge
said via e-mail. “To be clear, an attack on members of our NSHS Asian-American community is an attack on all of us. We will be working
on a plan for responding — I will share more about this soon.""
All Zoom meetings scheduled for Thursday were canceled, allowing the IT department and staff to check security protocols. Classes
were to resume Friday, said Julie McDonough, a school spokeswoman.
“Our counseling staff is reaching out to every student today,"" McDonough said. “We are scheduling a meeting with student leaders and
teachers to plan a response. Hate speech and racism have no place at South and won't be tolerated.""
School officials notified students' families and local police, who were investigating. Teachers and students were working with officials to
gather information about the intruders, who did not appear to be associated with the high school, according to Stembridge's e-mail.
The intruders may have accessed the meeting through a link to the call that was created before security updates were made in recent
weeks, Stembridge said. Hundreds of calls had been successful prior to the incident, he added.
The intrusion comes as millions of people adopt the online platform for work or education. Since the pandemic started, Zoom has
struggled to keep up with security features to prevent such incidents.
After two Massachusetts schools reported “Zoom-bombing"" in March, FBI officials in Boston urged users to take security precautions,
such as sending links to participants directly instead of posting links in publicly available areas and making sure users have the most
current version of Zoom's teleconferencing software.

The coronavirus pandemic has unleashed an explosion of anti-Asian racism in the United States, ranging from
derogatory slurs, to blaming the outbreak on Chinese people, to violent physical attacks. In an open letter to
school leaders in Boston, Quincy, and Malden, a coalition of Asian-American students and their supporters is
urging educators to take action now to ensure their safety as a new school year begins.
“In school, we feel we are not equal to other students. Whether it be among our peers, with faculty members in-
person or online, it is suffocating to know there are those who look at us cautiously and choose to ignore the
rising issue of xenophobia in the U.S.,” the letter said. “Our mental health is deteriorating, and our grades will
drop, impacting our futures in higher education. We feel unsafe returning to schools with unaddressed racism.”
Asian Americans have endured an onslaught of bullying and abuse in the months since the coronavirus outbreak
erupted in China. Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative of several California-based Asian American civil rights
organizations, has tracked more than 2,500 hate incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
between mid-March and early August, including reports of workplace discrimination, online harassment, and
physical assaults.
Stop AAPI Hate recorded 61 such incidents in Massachusetts.
Civil rights groups, such as the Anti-Defamation League, have accused President Trump and public officials of

exacerbating anti-Asian sentiment by referring to COVID-19 as “the Chinese virus” or “kung flu.”
The open letter, posted Sept. 21, has garnered more than 60 online signatures from students, teachers, parents,
and community members in and around Boston. Seventeen-year-old Sarah Xu, one of the six students who
coauthored the letter, organized the campaign through the nonprofit Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center.
She got the idea from a class at Boston Latin School, where she's now a senior, called “Facing History and
Ourselves."" The class, Xu said, examines “the unspoken narratives of different oppressed populations."" Shortly
before Boston schools closed, the class began discussing the recent surge of anti-Asian prejudice. With help
from the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood Center, she and the other students started drafting the letter this
spring. They finished polishing it just in time for the new school year.
“I was definitely afraid and anxious because this has never happened in my lifetime so far,"" Xu said in an
interview Monday, regarding the troubling rise in anti-Asian bigotry. “I'm thankful for the fact that I haven't
personally been attacked yet and I'm also in a community that keeps me safe.”
But in March, Xu still detected tension in her classes at Boston Latin, where roughly 30 percent of the students
are of Asian descent.
“It did feel uncomfortable at times when people would talk about COVID,"" she said. ""People couldn't help but
look at the Asians in the room.”
In the letter, the students described being stared at while walking down the street or riding the train. They
cannot go to the grocery store, they wrote, “without fear of strangers harassing us.""
“For me, I'm Chinese, so I wore masks very early,” 17-year-old Xi Zheng, a senior at North Quincy High School
and one of letter writers, told the Globe. She said she's afraid of leaving her home and “being attacked by a
racist.”
“People look at me very strangely,"" she continued, “and I feel very uncomfortable.”
The students asked school leaders “to stand in solidarity with communities of color” by publicly speaking out
against racism; hiring more diverse faculty and staff; hosting monthly anti-bias trainings; and teaching Ethnic
Studies. They also requested a system for “reporting incidents of racism,"" and listening sessions and healing
circles for students and families.
Letter writer Mandy Sun, who is also 17 and a senior at Boston Latin, said racism against Asian Americans is
“normalized,"" which she hadn't fully realized until the pandemic began. She recalled an incident in the spring,
when a white student at a nearby suburban high school wrote a scathing Facebook post blaming the virus on
Chinese people. Despite the student's outburst, her school didn't reprimand her, Sun said, because the student
later apologized on social media.
“It made me feel, at first, angry, and I started thinking, 'How are we going to move on from this? How are we
going to create a better society?' I feel like the only people who got outraged were in the Asian-American
community,"" Sun said. The episode left her feeling “slightly hopeless.”
Boston Public Schools spokesman Jonathan Palumbo said the district is reviewing the letter and working on a
response to the students. In an interview with the Globe on Tuesday, Malden Public Schools superintendent John
Oteri reiterated the district's commitment to anti-racism teaching and training.
“I think when you're doing anti-racism, anti-bias [work], you're trying to undo generations and, frankly,
centuries of systemic oppression. It's going to take awhile and it's always going to be a work in progress,” he
said. “I want to make Malden the most equitable, welcoming, inclusive school community, where people feel like
they belong.”

A year ago, Lunar New Year celebrations unfolded as COVID-19 began spreading globally, ushering in a new
wave of anti-Asian bias stoked by then-President Trump and the xenophobic rhetoric he used in labeling the
disease the “China virus.”
Now, as festivities this weekend mark another Lunar New Year, coronavirus vaccines offer relief from the virus
but not from the racism directed at people of Asian descent, who have seen the bias turn to violence, notably
against the elderly. The cases include the murder in San Francisco of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai
man; a subway attack in New York City during which a 61-year-old Flipino man was slashed across the face with
a knife; and several assaults targeting older Asian Americans in the Chinatown section of Oakland, Calif.
“This is not a problem that is new to our community,” Sam Hyun, chairman of the Massachusetts Asian American
Commission, said Saturday. “Even last year when we saw the spike happening, what we heard was a lot of
silence from the media and those in the highest seats of power.”
The national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 67 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and
discrimination between March 19 and Dec. 31, 2020, according to data released Tuesday.
Almost 90 percent of the cases from Massachusetts involved verbal harassment, about 7.5 percent were reports
of people being coughed on or spat upon, and 3 percent were physical assaults, said Russell Jeung, a co-founder

of Stop AAPI Hate and professor at San Francisco State University.
In one local incident reported to the organization, an Asian-American shopper said a woman at a grocery store
stated, “You will infect us.”
In another report from Massachusetts, a pedestrian said a driver screamed, “You're the reason I have to wear a
mask.” An elementary school teacher in Massachusetts reported that a student taunted a Chinese classmate by
claiming he had COVID-19 and telling other children not to go near him.
Jeung said only a small portion of the incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate would qualify for prosecution under
most laws against hate crimes.
“To address most of the hate incidents, we need a different type of policy solution and that includes expanded
civil rights enforcement,” he said.
A bill to reform the state's hate crime statute is pending in the Legislature and would expand the law to cover
harassment. Attorney General Maura Healey is co-sponsoring the legislation.
On Tuesday, she encouraged people to report hate crimes against Asian Americans to her office.
“Anti-Asian violence is on the rise,” she wrote. “The recent assaults on our elders are deeply disturbing.”
The state's Asian American Commission has developed a system for collecting reports about hate incidents and
has been using its online platforms to promote resources to combat the violence. Last spring, the commission
published a manual for responding to anti-Asian violence.
While several prominent activists and organizers said they haven't received reports about local Asian
communities being subjected to the same type of violence documented in California and New York, the incidents
have taken a psychological toll.
“It just adds to their level of stress,” said Ben Hires, chief executive of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood
Center.
Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents Chinatown, said some of the neighborhood's elderly residents
worry about leaving their homes to buy food or get fresh air because they fear being harassed in public.
“We have to show more empathy to the Asian community for the very difficult year that they've had,” said
Flynn. “They need to know that we're on their side and we're going to do everything we can to be helpful when
there is discrimination and bullying and intimidation or name calling.”
One way some advocates are trying to fight anti-Asian bias is by encouraging bystanders to speak up when they
witness wrongdoing. Distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, and immigration status sometimes prevent
victims from coming forward and that's why it's important for others to step up, they said.
“A lot of the folks that are being targeted, they're not going to be able to defend themselves or they're not going
to report it so we need to the community speak up for them,” Hires said.
President Biden addressed the racism, harassment, and hate crimes directed in a video marking the Lunar New
Year.
“It's simply wrong,” he said. “It's a stain on our national character. Every person, no matter their race,
background, religion, or language they speak, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.”

It happened in Chinatown first.
Before we had a single case in the city, before we had a mask mandate, before we had our first shut down, the
xenophobic stigma attached to coronavirus started to tear away at my neighborhood. Some businesses were
down by more than half by early February last year.
By April, the Center for Public Integrity found more than 30 percent of Americans had witnessed anti-Asian
discrimination.
A year later, Chinatown is a ghost of its former self. We used to feel like strangers who somehow belonged to
one another in the most minimally neighborly way. Now it all just feels strange.
The sidewalks no longer come alive with people. The sounds of Bostonians too busy to be quiet are mute. Eye
contact is rare.
Donald Trump used his power as president to paint the virus as China's fault. He empowered folk to act on their
hate. He openly bullied CBS News correspondent Weijia Jiang. Much like we saw a rise in Muslim hate after
9/11, with COVID-19 came a cultural complicity in anti-Asian violence.

Over the last year, Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that has documented incidents of anti-Asian
discrimination during the pandemic, has received nearly 3,000 accounts of anti-Asian assaults. Sixty-seven of
those incidents were reported in Massachusetts.
While this wave of hate may be pandemic-driven, anti-Asian attitudes have always existed in America.
Michael Tom was in second grade, waiting to swing into playground joy, when he heard kids laughing. They
pulled their eyes back. And said, “Ching-chong.”
Growing up in a mostly white suburb in Pennsylvania, it wasn't until 2010 as a Boston University student, that
he felt community. Exploring Chinatown and Quincy, breathing in the cultural celebration, gave him a sense of
pride.
“To be Asian American is to be stuck in between,” said Tom, 28, a Somerville public relations associate. “I often
feel like I am not American enough to be American. People readily assume I don't speak English. I was an Eagle
Scout whose grandfather fought in the Korean War for the United States.”
He's cautious about leaving the house. Early on in the pandemic, his brother was spat on while running in Philly.
For him, whether we are talking about the Hell's Canyon Massacre of 1887, the vicious murder of Vincent Chin
in 1982, or the recent violent attacks against Asians in America, it's related.
“White supremacy bears down on all of us,” Tom said. “America has a pattern of using Asian Americans as
pawns. Historically, you can see it with the Immigration Act and then post-World War II, you see it with the
myth of the model minority and the way it's used to pit Asian Americans against Black Americans and Latinx
Americans. Who benefits? Who is pulling the strings behind us?”
America has always used citizenship, discrimination, and division to preserve whiteness.
During the era of World War II and the internment of Japanese Americans, everyone from Dr. Seuss to Life
magazine pushed anti-Japanese propaganda. Over time the hate was baked into American culture, and it
showed up in Boston, too.
In 1987, the Asian American Resource Workshop wrote a report, “To Live in Peace ... Responding to Anti-Asian
Violence in Boston.” The report cites incidents like the case of Chinese immigrant Long Guang Huang, who was
brutally beaten by a police officer in Chinatown in May 1985.
About seven years later, when Kibbee Miller was born, her parents knew they had to prepare her for a world that
would look at her differently.
Growing up in Mattapan, she was not yet 10 by the time classmates asked if her mom packed cat or dog in her
lunchbox. Around that same time, she was called the N-word for the first time.
A Black woman who is also Chinese, Miller said stereotypes about Asians make people think they can get away
with hate and violence. And anti-Blackness in America affects everything.
Not every assault on Asian Americans, Black folk, and marginalized communities is by a white person. White
supremacy birthed this divisive and violent behavior. A side effect is that prejudice affects how people of color
see each other and mistreat each other, too.
“There's this idea of Asians being submissive, quiet, and nonthreatening. At the same time the model minority
myth aligns Asians with whiteness. It's fragmenting us. We are all fighting systemic racism. But to tear down
these barriers we have to also talk about anti-Blackness in the Asian community.”
For Miller, these are her identities. And she had to fight both anti-Blackness and anti-Asian attitudes to embrace

herself. To her, the cultures overlap, from the way they center family to how they cherish their elders to the
importance of family dinners. And both cultures are experiencing racial trauma.
“Colonialism is so indoctrinated in America,” said Miller, 29, a Boston digital marketer. “We have to come
together.”
But what will that take? Carolyn Su thinks we need to be able to lay all the messy, complicated, and painful
truths bare. To understand accountability is not a punishment but a way forward.
When Su moved to Arlington from Texas in 2013, she noticed how teachers were confusing her daughter, a
preschooler then, with the other Asian student in her class. It was her own history repeating itself.
“I was very much ashamed of being Taiwanese American because that is what I was taught by all of the
implicit messages growing up. Do I want my daughter to feel that same sense of self-loathing, fear, and
shame? Or do I want her to feel proud of all that she is?”
Su had to put in self-work to gain confidence and examine how her insecurity around her identity stemmed
from how Asian Americans are deemed outsiders. The recent rise in violence against Asian Americans, has
been a reminder of the source of that fear.
“It's brought to light how Asian Americans can be so easily demonized as the perpetual foreigners,” said Su,
37, founder of Diverse We Run, celebrating athletic inclusion.
“We can be so quickly blamed as having been the cause of this pandemic and therefore any anger can be
directed toward Asians and justified. For so many Asians, it's representative of our experience, like the pain
and hurt that we feel doesn't matter,” she added.
Su doesn't know where to start, but she knows acknowledgement is necessary.
“There's no fixing it if we don't agree on there even being a problem to be fixed,” she said. “I don't know. It
always feels like the people of color who are affected by white supremacy are tasked with solving it.”
Mayoral candidate Michelle Wu believes we have to start with partnership, community, and policy.
“It's not enough to say we are having a conversation about Asian American issues and check the boxes. It's
not enough to do that with any identity,” the city councilor said. “Just as important are policy changes. We
need to make sure there are processes and everyone needs to have a voice in shaping the future.”
Like Miller and Tom, Wu's first experiences with racism date back to being teased over her seaweed snacks
and having her language mocked as a young girl in Illinois. She would see the bias again, even more
painfully, in how her mother was treated by the mental health care system.
“What I have known my whole life and what I have found in shared connection with far too many Asian
American friends is a feeling of invisibility,” Wu said.
It wasn't until she was a student at Harvard, volunteering in Chinatown at the Asian American Civic
Association, that she felt truly connected to the pieces of her identity she had to code-switch growing up. We
can't let that happen to the next generation.
“There's over 110 different languages spoken in BPS,” Wu said. “The breadth and beauty here, the diversity of
race, ethnicity, background, lived experiences — for me it is most important to create the spaces and
community for people to bring their full multidimensional selves into the conversation.”
In February 2020, as Chinatown was being crushed by xenophobia, Wu co-hosted a dim sum brunch at China

The slayings of six Asian women at spas in the Atlanta area were seen Wednesday by some members of Massachusetts' Asian community as another expression of long-festering
racism — and part of a surge of anti-Asian violence since the coronavirus pandemic began.
Steven S. Kim, a Brighton defense attorney who emigrated from Korea with his family when he was 5 years old, said passing drivers routinely shout racial epithets at him, and
clients have rejected him because of his heritage.
“It's a terrible scourge that has always been there,'' said Kim, who was deployed to Afghanistan in 2011 as a member of the Massachusetts National Guard. “The undercurrent and
the underbelly of this country has always had that.”
He added: “There is this very tiring trope that Asian Americans have lived with for our entire existence here, whether you are first generation, second generation, third or forth.
And that's the consistent perception amongst the rest of the American population that we are foreigners. That we don't belong.”
Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu issued a statement decrying the shootings. Eight people in total were killed at three spas during the rampage, according to investigators. Seven
of the victims were women.
“I join our Asian American community in mourning, and solidarity, following the senseless shootings in the Atlanta area last night,” she wrote on her Twitter account Wednesday.
“It's heartbreaking & appalling to see the anti-Asian harassment, violence, and now mass murder that has accelerated over the past year.”
In her statement, Wu, an at-large city councilor who is a candidate to succeed Mayor Martin J. Walsh, said the incident was “part of a long history of racism in American that we
must all fight to end.”
“All too often, the most silenced members of our community — Asian American elders and women working in invisible industries — have borne the brunt of these attacks,” she
wrote.
Police said they arrested Robert Aaron Long, 21, after a brief manhunt following Tuesday's shootings. He confessed to the shootings during an interview with authorities and said
his actions were not racially motivated, police said.
Long was charged Wednesday with four counts of murder and one count of assault, officials said.
Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it was still early in the investigation and a determination had not yet been made whether it was a hate crime.
The killings come as crimes against Asian Americans have spiked across the United States. Since the start of the pandemic, Asian Americans reported nearly 3,800 hate-related
incidents in all 50 states, according to a report released Tuesday by Stop AAPI Hate, an organization that advocates for Asian and Pacific Islander Americans.
“The unconscionable blaming of Asian American communities for the devastation of this pandemic has reinforced the sense of invisibility and perpetual foreigner status that so
many of us have known our entire lives‚” Wu wrote.
The daughter of immigrants from Taiwan, Wu wrote about her own personal experiences, saying that “some of my most vivid childhood memories involve racist encounters with
strangers. People who knew nothing about me except for my appearance feeling empowered to pull eyes into slits, or to chant ching chong sounds.”
She said she knew “that constant feeling of needing to be aware, ready, on guard whenever out in public,” she said.
She added that ”since before COVID-19 was spreading in United States, Asian American communities have been on edge. Boston has not been immune these incidents.”
Vinh Bui, 36, of Dorchester, said he felt angry when he learned about what happened in Atlanta.
Bui was born in refugee camp and came to the United States when he was two months old. He grew up in Fields Corner and said throughout his childhood he experienced
discrimination firsthand for being part of what he called “the invisible minority.”
“I was bullied my entire childhood,” Bui said. “I was assaulted by older kids, and sometimes verbally assaulted by adults...As a kid I was spat on. I had black eyes and busted lips
growing up. I didn't know what a 'gook' was until they started calling me that.”

202004,"
On a cold and blustery morning, I was on Manhattan's Lower East Side having dim sum with a friend. Carrying
our leftovers, we went our separate ways. As I waited below ground for the next L train, a Latina woman came
up to me in the otherwise empty corridor and gave me a hard shove. I could see her breath fume out of her
nostrils as I stumbled backward. She yelled a racial slur at me and walked out of the station. It was March 2020,
just as COVID-19 was gripping the nation. At the time, the Asian reaction was mostly to tiptoe around the news
that came out of Wuhan. But people weren't tiptoeing around us.
Hate crimes as a whole declined last year, but they went up against Asian Americans by almost 150 percent in
16 large US cities — 133 percent in Boston — according to the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at
California State University, San Bernardino. The center attributed the steep rise to “negative stereotyping of
Asians relating to the pandemic” in tandem with the rise in COVID-19 cases last March. By the time I was
getting forcefully pushed, the spike in anti-Asian assaults had already galvanized several advocacy groups to
form a nonprofit, Stop AAPI (Asian American Pacific Islander) Hate, to track hate incidents and crimes; it has
recorded nearly 3,800 so far. I thought we'd be past this by now.
But we are not. Yesterday, eight people were killed, many of them women of Asian descent, in a series of
apparently connected shootings at three spas and massage parlors in the Atlanta area. “The reported shootings
of Asian American women on Tuesday in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy — for the families of the victims first
and foremost, but also for the AAPI community — which has been reeling from high levels of racial

discrimination,” Stop AAPI Hate wrote on Twitter.
Despite the steady vaccine rollout and the decrease of COVID-19 deaths and hospitalizations, anti-Asian
violence continues to rise. Social media is full of symbolic and physical threats. Racist incidents are surging so
much that the White House, informed by Stop AAPI Hate data and other advocacy groups, held a listening
session on March 4 with AAPI leaders. In a speech March 11, President Biden urged the nation to put an end to
this division, saying that Asian Americans are being “attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated,” adding,
“It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop.” Why is this still happening?
Incited by a dangerous mixture of paranoia and ignorance, and further fueled by the Capitol storming of January
6 by Trump supporters, some Americans are targeting their AAPI neighbors. In late February, at the
Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, the former president once again talked about the “China
virus” and was cheered by the audience. He weaponized COVID-19 initially by calling it the “Wuhan virus” and
“kung flu” during his presidency; after he contracted COVID in October, anti-Asian rhetoric and conspiracy
theories on Twitter went up 85 percent, according to the Anti-Defamation League.
From the beginning of the Gold Rush to the hysterics of “yellow peril,” Asian Americans have long been used as
vessels of blame and anxiety. This happened during World War II when more than 120,000 Japanese Americans
were ordered into internment camps, and after 9/11 when South Asians were victims of xenophobia and
Islamophobia.
We're invalidated as people of color and ignored as equal citizens. In a recent New York Times article, actor
Steven Yeun wondered aloud “if the Asian-American experience is what it's like when you're thinking about
everyone else, but nobody else is thinking about you.” Noel Quintana, a 61-year-old Filipino American whose
face was slashed with a box cutter in February, remembers the invisibility he suffered in the New York City
subway: “Nobody came. Nobody helped. Nobody made a video,” he told the Washington Post. After generations
of assimilation and sacrifice, why is the silence surrounding Asian Americans still louder than the Asian voice?
I stopped wearing a mask in public after the incident last March, fearing I'd be accused of having the virus.
Meanwhile, my Chinese friend in Queens was attacked and spit on for not wearing one, singled out as diseased
despite being in a train with other mask-less commuters. My best friend was called racial slurs as she commuted
to class at Boston University. My mother, wearing her N95 mask while grocery shopping in Braintree, received
cautious, disdainful glances from white mothers. My grandmother felt the same alienating tensions when she
visited her senior center in Quincy, feeling invisible from white visitors who avoided sitting next to her. From
grandmother, to mother, to daughter, our proximity to this violence and constant threat of bias alters how we go
about our daily lives and isolates the Asian in our Asian-American identity.
I first came to this realization in high school when my friend's mom pointed out what she perceived as the
difference between me and my other Asian friend: I was “the one that's super Americanized.” After years of
transforming myself into an all-American girl, I was so close to winning the game. But despite all the American
culture I had absorbed (and Asian culture I had lost), still, I am disqualified. Not truly American, only American-
ized. I'm now 21 and have been living in New York City for the past three years, but I'm hesitant to call it home.
How has the most diverse city in the United States become a place that makes me feel unsafe, unsure, and un-
American?
My mom, a 46-year-old Chinese woman who's lived in the United States for 30 years, told me over a steaming
hot-pot that Asians have never gotten the same respect as white people in this country. “We work hard, we
respect others, and we don't cause trouble.” The rise in cases is discouraging, but Manjusha Kulkarni, cofounder
of Stop AAPI Hate, tells me she feels “heartened by the acts of civic duty Asian Americans are taking.” We're
persevering through injustice and demanding action, but we've had to sacrifice, proving ourselves through the
currency of pain and suffering.

Guns and hate. Hate and guns. It's the same story over and over again in the United States. Only the details of
the particular weapon, and the particular bigotry consuming the killer, seem to change.
On Tuesday, a man opened fire at three spas in the Atlanta area, killing eight. Six of the victims were women of
Asian descent.
The police said the alleged shooter was a 21-year-old sex addict who may have patronized the spas in the past
and wanted to eliminate them because they were a source of temptation.
He was caught as he headed to Florida, where he may have planned to target “some type of porn industry,”
according to Sheriff Frank Reynolds of Cherokee County, Ga.
To the Asian American community, which has suffered from a series of high-profile attacks, the fact that the
shooter may not necessarily have been specifically motivated by anti-Asian hate comes as no relief. Considering
the long history in this country of anti-Asian violence, recent efforts by former president Donald Trump to blame
the COVID-19 pandemic on China, and the spate of depraved assaults on Asian Americans that have been
caught on video recently, there's a good reason why so many Asian Americans are on edge.
The killings take place “in a landscape where Asian Americans are increasingly terrified and fearful for their lives
and their safety because of these escalating threats against our people,” said Michelle Au, a Georgia state
senator who represents an Atlanta-area district.

Robert Aaron Long is a terrorist.
He told police he went on a killing spree, murdering eight people, most of them women of Asian descent,
because of his sex addiction. The Asian massage spas he targeted, officials said, were “a temptation that he
wanted to eliminate.”
He's been charged with murder and assault. It doesn't appear to be racially motivated, some officials say. Some
believe it's too early in the investigation to call it a hate crime. Even the president and vice president are shying
away from motives.
Domestic terrorism, as described by the FBI, is violent, criminal acts committed to further ideological goals. This
can stem from political, religious, social, racial, or environmental nature.
Long prioritized his sexual morality over human life. He fetishized Asian women. He apparently believed he had
the right to kill whomever tempted him to stray from his faith. If this is not a hate crime, laws need to be
rewritten. If we cannot see this mass shooting as terrorism, we need to redefine it.
Stop calling him “the 21-year-old,” as if his youth is an excuse. Stop digging into how he was super nice,
“nerdy,” and “big into religion.” Call Long a murderer, a terrorist, a sexist, and a racist. Care more about his
victims, like Delaina Ashley Yaun and Xiaojie Yan.

They were alive. They had dreams. They were loved by somebody who is missing them today.
And yet, Georgia officials seem to want to soften their killer.
“He was pretty much fed up, at the end of his rope and this was a very bad day for him and this is what he did,”
said a Cherokee County Sheriff's Office spokesman, Captain Jay Baker.
A very bad day? The sympathy for the devil is real.
Over five years ago, when Dylann Roof murdered nine worshipers at the historic Emanuel African Methodist
Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C., folk were hesitant to call him a terrorist.
Back then, I wrote, “I guess people shy away from calling acts like this terrorism because that would mean
white supremacy in itself is a terrorist act. And we live in a country that operates on systemic racism.”
This is still true. And like all forms of racism against nonwhite people, America likes to erase the reality. Pretend
progress is easier than actually taking into account the violence supremacy inflicts.
And when the victims are women, well, it's been a year since police killed Breonna Taylor in Louisville and there
is no justice to be had. America, like the rest of the world, devalues girls and women — especially girls and
women of color.
Women of Asian descent are no exception. Almost a quarter of Asian American and Pacific Islander women in
America have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lives, according to a CDC 2010-2012 report on
intimate partner and sexual violence.
Long was specific in the kind of temptation he targeted for destruction: Asian spas.
The hypersexualization of Asian women in Hollywood, pornography, and historic novels, combined with the
stereotype of submissiveness, contribute to the fetishization that leads to sexual violence and trafficking of
women and girls of Asian descent. These tropes and violence date back to World War II, the Korean War,
Vietnam War, and places of US military occupation, like South Korea.
Add this violent, sexual bias to the past year of anti-Asian assaults stirred up by Donald Trump empowering
xenophobic, racist ideals around COVID-19, and the truth is undeniable. It's imperative we call racism exactly
what it is: racism.
Over the last year, Stop AAPI Hate, a national coalition that has documented incidents of anti-Asian
discrimination during the pandemic, has received nearly 3,800 accounts of anti-Asian assaults from March 19,
2020 to Feb. 28, 2021.
Last week, President Biden condemned the hate against Asian Americans as he addressed the nation on the
one-year anniversary of the pandemic.
“Too often, we have turned against one another,” Biden said. “A mask, the easiest thing to do to save lives,
sometimes, it divides us, states pitted against one another, instead of working with each other, vicious hate
crimes against Asian Americans, who have been attacked, harassed, blamed, and scapegoated.”
“At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans, they're on the front lines of this pandemic trying
to save lives, and still, still they're forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's
wrong. It's un-American. And it must stop,” he added.
But how, when legislation and law enforcement rarely work in our favor?

202004,"
A horrific spate of shootings in Georgia on Tuesday has left eight people dead, many of them women of Asian
descent, at a time when reported anti-Asian hate crimes have skyrocketed over the course of the coronavirus
pandemic.
The shootings occurred at two massage parlors in Atlanta and one in the suburbs. A 21-year-old male suspect
was taken into custody hours after a manhunt, police said.
On social media, members of the Asian American community shared personal testimonials of the blatant racism
and microaggressions they have faced in their lifetime, precautions they have taken in the wake of recent
attacks, and words of grief following the killings.
While the motive of the suspect — a white man — has not yet been determined, many have drawn a connection
between the rise in crimes against Asian Americans throughout the pandemic and the shooting deaths of the
women he allegedly killed.
The organization Asian Americans Advancing Justice noted while there is “much to learn tonight” about the
shootings in Georgia, many of the “victims are Asian, calling into question if this is related to recent hate crimes
and assaults against Asian Americans.”

“We have heavy hearts tonight as we mourn eight people who have lost their lives in a senseless act of
violence,” the organization wrote on Twitter.
An analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San
Bernardino, which looked at police department statistics across the United States, revealed that the nation saw
a considerable hike in anti-Asian hate crimes last year in numerous major cities.
The study examined hate crimes in 16 of America's major cities, and found that while such crimes decreased by
7 percent in 2020, those committed against Asian Americans surged by nearly 150 percent. In Boston, hate
crimes rose from six reported in 2019 to 14 reported in 2020, according to the analysis, equivalent to a 133
percent rise.
In New York Tuesday night, NYPD Assistant Chief Martine Materasso said the department deployed Critical
Response Command units to Asian communities.
“While there is no known nexus to #NYC we will be deploying assets to our great Asian communities across the
city out of an abundance of caution,” Materasso wrote on Twitter.
Late Tuesday night, Georgia Governor Brian Kemp weighed in on the tragedies, expressing sympathy for those
affected.
“Our entire family is praying for the victims of these horrific acts of violence,” Kemp wrote on Twitter.
Georgia Senator Raphael Warnock said his heart “is broken tonight after the tragic violence in Atlanta that took
eight lives.”
“Once again we see that hate is deadly,” Warnock wrote on Twitter. “Praying for the families of the victims and
for peace for the community.”
Some were quick to note the role former president Donald Trump may have played in spurring anti-Asian
sentiments. At the beginning of the pandemic — and as recently as Tuesday evening during a televised interview
on Fox News — Trump used racist language targeting Asian Americans and the Chinese community.
He has referred to the coronavirus as “the China virus” and “kung flu,” racist slurs that quickly became a rallying
cry for his supporters.
President Biden acknowledged the violence committed against Asian Americans less than a week ago, saying,
“It's wrong. It's un-American. And it must stop.”
Yet many Asian Americans shared that racism, whether overt or in the form of microaggressions, has been
present throughout the course of their lives. And others online said America's history and policies have long
pointed to racial injustice toward the community.
Activist Timothy Phan wrote on Twitter that “if your automatic response to anti-Asian violence in #atlanta today
is blame Donald Trump, you haven't done enough to process the history of anti-Asian xenophobia in this
country's wretched history towards working-class immigrants of color.”
Alton Wang, a J.D. candidate at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law, said that growing up, his
“ever cautious dad” always chided him to be observant and alert of his surroundings — a “critical reminder now.”
“That the shooter targeted Asian women is not a coincidence,” Wang wrote on Twitter. “The misogynistic racism
directed at Asian women is evident not just on platforms like Twitter, but in history — the roots of our broken,
racist immigration system began by banning entry of Chinese women under the Page Act.”

202004,"
When she first read the headlines from Georgia, Danielle Kim knew in her bones what horror had come to pass.
A series of shootings at three spas in Atlanta and a nearby suburb had left eight people dead, including six Asian women. At least four of the six women were of
Korean descent, like Kim.
“It was clear to me this was not just a random attack on just regular small businesses,"" Kim said. “It appeared, based on what we're seeing, that this likely may
have been a lot more targeted toward the Asian community and specifically, Asian women.""
The suspect in custody — a 21-year-old white man named Robert Aaron Long — claimed he was not motivated by racism. But to many Asian Americans,
Tuesday's deadly rampage felt like the culmination of a year in which anti-Asian racism has soared.
In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Asian Americans have been insulted, harassed, spat upon, shunned, beaten, and killed. The organization Stop AAPI
Hate has recorded nearly 3,800 anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide since last March, when the group first started tracking the attacks. More than two-thirds of
the victims, the group noted, were women.
Law enforcement officials have said that Long claimed he was motivated by “sexual addiction,"" but investigators are not ruling out the role anti-Asian bias might
have played. Long has been charged with eight counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault.
Four of the victims who were killed have been identified: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Tan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44.
Regardless of the motive, the slayings have rattled many Asian Americans, still reeling from the recent and highly publicized assaults on Asian elders in California
and New York. On Jan. 28, an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee was brutally beaten during his morning walk in San Francisco. He died of his
injuries days later.
Earlier this month, an 83-year-old Korean women in White Plains, N.Y., was struck so hard she blacked out.
As she processed the news, Kim thought of her Korean parents, small-business owners in New Jersey, and her near constant worry for their safety. And she was
reminded of an incident last March, at the beginning of the pandemic, when a middle-aged white woman snarled at her to “go back to where [she] came from""
as they passed each other in the Seaport.
“That comment sat with me for days and weeks to come,"" said Kim, secretary of the Massachusetts Asian American Commission. “Every once in a while, I'll think
back to that moment.""
This past year of sickness, isolation, and death has been emotionally and psychologically taxing for nearly everyone, but for Asian Americans, grief and anxiety
have been compounded by anti-Asian sentiment fueled by the pandemic. Civil rights groups have accused former president Donald Trump of stoking the flames
of hate when he referred to the coronavirus as the “China virus"" or “Kung flu."" But the history of anti-Asian racism is much longer.
Historian Ellen Wu, director of the Asian American Studies Program at Indiana University, said Tuesday's killings stem from a wretched tradition of discrimination
against Asian women, who are stereotyped not only as passive and submissive, but as hypersexual and exotic.
The fetishization of Asian women began with the Page Law of 1875, the first federal statute to restrict immigration to the United States. The law was ostensibly
aimed at preventing Chinese prostitutes from entering the country, but in practice, it excluded virtually all Chinese women, Wu said. During and after the Korean

immigration to the United States. The law was ostensibly aimed at preventing Chinese prostitutes from entering
the country, but in practice, it excluded virtually all Chinese women, Wu said. During and after the Korean War,
American soldiers regularly frequented Asian sex workers — women, Wu notes, who “didn't have a lot of
options” in countries devastated by war.
From “Madame Butterfly” to “Sayonara,” the image of the feminine, sexual, and subservient Asian woman has
been recycled generation after generation in popular culture, Wu said, and consequently, has become
“embedded in our collective cultural imagination.” And so for many Asian American women, it's impossible to
separate the Georgia shooter's apparent misogyny from the specter of racism.
“There is often a lot of unchecked, invisible violence that exists for Asian women, whether it's because of their
race, or because of their immigration status, or the type of industry they're in,” said Lisette Le, executive
director of VietAID, a Fields Corner nonprofit that primarily serves Vietnamese nail salon workers. “They can be
seen as disposable.”
Boston City Councilor and mayoral candidate Michelle Wu, a daughter of Taiwanese immigrants, recounted in a
statement her own experiences with anti-Asian racism following Tuesday's attacks.
“Some of my most vivid childhood memories involve racist encounters with strangers,” she wrote. “People who
knew nothing about me except for my appearance feeling empowered to pull eyes into slits, or to chant ching
chong sounds.”
She also described “that constant feeling of needing to be aware, ready, on guard whenever out in public.”

make up about 6 percent of the population, up from about 2 percent in 1980, William Frey, chief demographer

Ro Nguyen thought it would play out differently.
The 30-year-old had just watched a movie at a Streeterville cinema with a friend on March 12 and was strolling down East Grand Avenue around 8 p.m., the two of them
marveling at the deserted streets.
As they headed toward the Red Line station, Nguyen said a man walking nearby saw them and yelled out, ""F--- China!""
Then the man spat on Nguyen, he said. The saliva splattered on his jacket.
Nguyen, who is of Vietnamese and Filipino descent, had imagined this moment. Having read news stories about harassment and attacks against Asians as coronavirus cases
rose, he wondered if he would be next. If he was, he thought he would take a stand on behalf of himself and other Asians.
But as he wiped the saliva off with his sleeve, he and his friend -- of South Asian descent -- hurried away without a word to the assailant.
""In that instance, I was just kind of shocked, or dumbfounded, of what occurred,"" Nguyen said.
Nguyen worries that East Asians in the United States will face even more harassment and attacks as coronavirus cases continue to rise. He said he believes President Donald
Trump stoked such hate-filled reaction during a news briefing last week when he defended his use of ""Chinese virus.""
""It's not racist at all,"" Trump said. ""I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China."" He also said he was using the expression to fight back against Beijing
officials who were blaming the U.S. military for the introduction of the disease.
The World Health Organization has recommended people use coronavirus or COVID-19, stating that other characterizations spread negative stereotypes.
On Monday, Trump appeared to walk back his earlier position, using the word ""coronavirus"" and stressing it was important to ""totally protect our Asian American community.""
""Yes, it seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country,"" he admitted. ""I don't like that at all. These are incredible people,
they love our country and I'm not going to let it happen.""
But Nguyen fears it's too late. Since the president and other politicians first used the term, Nguyen and other Asians in Chicago said they have felt growing apprehension that
people take the president's comments as a license for racism.
Elsewhere in the U.S., reports of hate crimes have cropped up from New York to San Francisco, some caught on video and circulated through social media. In California's San
Fernando Valley, a 16-year-old was sent to the emergency room after being beat up and accused of having the coronavirus at his high school, CBS News reported.
""It's outrageous,"" said state Rep. Theresa Mah from the 2nd District, which includes Chicago's Chinatown. ""Chinese Americans and constituents of mine understand this is a
situation in which they could potentially be scapegoats for the uncertainty people feel.""
'History is repeating itself'
Mabel Menard was sitting alone at her favorite neighborhood tavern in Old Town earlier this month when she noticed an unfamiliar face.
A man, very intoxicated, made eye contact with her and said, ""Do you have the corona?""
Menard, a 58-year-old Chinese American, said she didn't think twice before quipping, ""I'm having a wine.""
The bar's staff kicked the man out.
""I kind of thought he was an idiot,"" Menard said. ""That's the kind of mentality that you walk around with, thinking that you're better than anybody else, and the way to make
you feel better is to be nasty to other people. I think that's pretty sad.""

202004,"
My parents have seen it all.
As Japanese Americans, they experienced as children the pain of internment during World War II, one of the terrible scars in our country's past that stemmed from fear, hate
and racism. They lived through the horrors of 9/11 and witnessed the discrimination against Muslims in the wake of those attacks. With the coronavirus pandemic today, they
are hearing the all-too-familiar vitriol toward Asian Americans being spewed from the dark and angry corners of social media and beyond.
Although they remained stoic and largely reserved in the decades that followed internment, their quiet resilience changed dramatically after 9/11. They would begin to speak
out against the injustices of that time, becoming activists in their own right.
Now, as a Chicagoan who for nearly two decades worked for the Chicago Department of Public Health, I can't remain silent as I witness the bigotry that has percolated in
Chicago and across the country in response to the novel coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan, China. Racism has its own virulence that is bad for the nation's soul and,
as research has shown, is actually bad for the nation's health.
My family's path to the Midwest began in those internment camps. In order to leave, family members secured employment in Chicago. Despite prejudice and fear among many
Chicago businesses and their employees, my grandparents and parents were given opportunities at Wrap-on Tools and Edgewater Beach Hotel. My grandparents became
valuable, dependable and loyal employees and challenged their children to excel too.
Given a chance, my parents thrived, both finishing high school and going on to college. My dad joined the Army and then went to dental school on the GI Bill. My mom became
a high school art teacher. They were resilient and didn't dwell on the past, raising their children with strong values, including sacrifice and service to others. My parents'
influence is a key reason I chose my career path in public health and now work at a foundation that advocates for a fair and just opportunity for everyone in America.
But my parents were spurred to action after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. As fear, discrimination and violence toward Muslims increased, they spoke out against these injustices. In
recent years, they raised their voices again as federal policies became more punitive and restrictive for immigrants and refugees. Normally soft-spoken and unassuming, my
parents shared their experiences in panel discussions, newsletters and as featured guests of a multimedia exhibit depicting the internment of Japanese Americans, ""Then They
Came for Me.""
The resilience I learned from them has buoyed me and my three brothers, as we too have experienced racism, including crude and hateful remarks. My parents taught us to
turn the other cheek, to be confident in our identity and values, no matter the situation.
Now, I must speak out in the face of new attacks on Asian Americans. A preliminary analysis, in fact, examined nearly 1 million tweets focused on racial minorities between
November 2019 and March 2020 -- the period when the novel coronavirus went from outbreak to pandemic. The percentage of tweets involving negative speech against Asian
Americans increased 70% during that period while falling 4% for all other racial minority groups. (The research team was comprised of a group of doctors, including Gilbert Gee
from UCLA along with Thu Nguyen of UCSF, Shanise Criss of Furman University, Quyen Nguyen of the University of Maryland and David Chae of Tulane.)
This treatment of Asian Americans is immoral, but also dangerous to public health. Research shows that hateful speech and other actions against racial and ethnic minorities --
even seemingly small slights -- might make people sick, contributing to heart disease, respiratory illness and other chronic diseases. In an environment where people of any
race feel threatened, they might be less likely to seek treatment out of fear and distrust of our medical system. This is especially dangerous in the midst of a pandemic when we
should be lowering barriers to care, not raising them.
During and after this pandemic, we must treat Asian Americans not as enemies, but as fellow victims of this insidious virus that does not distinguish by place, race, age or
gender. This is the time to support our neighbors, not turn on them. These are the values that define our nation.
John of the Cross, a 16th century Catholic priest and mystic, wrote that ""In the evening of our lives we will be judged only by how we have loved."" As a nation, we will be
judged now by how we treat people in need. That's a lesson I learned from my parents, and a value I carry proudly in my work and everyday life.
In this time of the novel coronavirus, we are all in need of understanding, compassion and love. This is good for the soul, and for the health of our nation.

Sonny Vinuya hasn't decided if he'll vote again for Donald Trump in the battleground state of Nevada.
The Filipino American businessman in Las Vegas is personally offended by the president's use of a racist slur at
recent reelection rallies, where he mocked China and the COVID-19 pandemic's origins in Asia. But most
important to Vinuya is the economy, which has also been sinking into a pandemic-triggered recession despite a
robust stimulus package.
Though it's tough for the registered Republican to swallow the racism against his own community, Vinuya said
he doesn't think Trump is trying to alienate Asian American voters when the president uses derogatory terms at
campaign events or continues to call COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus.""
The Pew Research Center recently declared Asian Americans to be the fastest-growing racial or ethnic group in
the U.S. electorate, but they are also arguably the least competitive voter block for Trump when considering
where they live and how they relate to the Republican Party.
In Nevada, where Vinuya lives, Asians make up more than 10% of voters in a state both Democrats and
Republicans will fight for in the fall.

older white voters thrilled by his inflammatory statements than to lose among the Asian American community,
said Karthick Ramakrishnan, a public policy professor at the University of California, Riverside and founder of
AAPI Data, which tracks Asian Americans.
That's because Asian Americans largely vote in very blue districts and otherwise non-competitive states,
Ramakrishnan said. A third of all such voters live in California alone.
""Part of the reason we don't see very much outreach is because Asian Americans tend to live in non-competitive
states in presidential elections,"" Ramakrishnan said.
Trump's words have angered many Asian Americans and drawn condemnation from Trump's Democratic rival Joe
Biden and former President Barack Obama. Republicans have also denounced the racist slur, notably Kellyanne
Conway, a White House counselor who is married to an Asian American, George Conway, whose mother was
from the Philippines.
White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended the president's rhetoric, saying he's not being racist
but merely linking the virus to its place of origin. Trump in March also insisted that Asian Americans were
""amazing people"" and not at fault for spreading the virus.
Since the virus took hold of the U.S. in March, advocates have also reported a rise in anti-Asian aggression and
violence from people blaming them for the pandemic. A group called Stop AAPI Hate said on July 1 that it has
tracked 832 incidents of discrimination and harassment in California over the past 12 weeks.
Biden at a June 27 town hall for Asian American voters slammed Trump's ""dangerous theories"" as xenophobic.
""Words matter and the president's words matter even more,"" Biden said.
The number of Asian Americans aligning themselves with the Democratic party has increased over the past 20
years while support for the GOP has trended down. A different Pew analysis in 2018 showed Democrats held a
2-to-1 advantage among Asian American registered voters. The 27% who identified as or leaned Republican
represented a 6% drop since 1998.
For Trump, AAPI Data found nearly all major Asian American ethnic groups held an unfavorable view of the
president. The only exception was the 62% of Vietnamese surveyed in 2018 who said they held a favorable
impression of him. On the other end of the spectrum, just 14% of Japanese voters felt the same way.
In the top 10 states with the largest Asian American voting populations, Trump in 2016 won only Texas and
Florida. But the ultimate swing state in this year's election, Ramakrishnan said, is unlikely to be determined by
the 3.6% of Florida voters who are Asian American given how large the state is.
That means in smaller states like Nevada, the deeper concentration of eligible Asian American voters -- the
fourth-highest behind Hawaii, California and Washington state -- could potentially move the needle. About 11%
of Nevada's voters are Asian.
Trump lost the Silver State in 2016 to rival Democrat Hillary Clinton by just 2.4 percentage points, though
Nevada now leans more blue.
For Vinuya, who has been courted by the Trump campaign as the president of the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of
Commerce, he knows he could be one of the few Asian American voters nationally who can make a difference
for the president's reelection prospects.
Vinuya said he's expressed his concerns about the anti-Asian slur to Trump's team, especially as he's trying to
help his 600-plus members overcome the virus-related stigma and discrimination evident against Asian
American and Asian immigrant small business owners in Las Vegas.

202004,"
A year ago, Lunar New Year celebrations unfolded as COVID-19 began spreading globally, ushering in a new
wave of anti-Asian bias stoked by then-President Trump and the xenophobic rhetoric he used in labeling the
disease the “China virus.”
Now, as festivities this weekend mark another Lunar New Year, coronavirus vaccines offer relief from the virus
but not from the racism directed at people of Asian descent, who have seen the bias turn to violence, notably
against the elderly. The cases include the murder in San Francisco of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai
man; a subway attack in New York City during which a 61-year-old Flipino man was slashed across the face with
a knife; and several assaults targeting older Asian Americans in the Chinatown section of Oakland, Calif.
“This is not a problem that is new to our community,” Sam Hyun, chairman of the Massachusetts Asian American
Commission, said Saturday. “Even last year when we saw the spike happening, what we heard was a lot of
silence from the media and those in the highest seats of power.”
The national coalition Stop AAPI Hate received 67 reports from Massachusetts of anti-Asian hate and
discrimination between March 19 and Dec. 31, 2020, according to data released Tuesday.
Almost 90 percent of the cases from Massachusetts involved verbal harassment, about 7.5 percent were reports
of people being coughed on or spat upon, and 3 percent were physical assaults, said Russell Jeung, a co-founder

of Stop AAPI Hate and professor at San Francisco State University.
In one local incident reported to the organization, an Asian-American shopper said a woman at a grocery store
stated, “You will infect us.”
In another report from Massachusetts, a pedestrian said a driver screamed, “You're the reason I have to wear a
mask.” An elementary school teacher in Massachusetts reported that a student taunted a Chinese classmate by
claiming he had COVID-19 and telling other children not to go near him.
Jeung said only a small portion of the incidents reported to Stop AAPI Hate would qualify for prosecution under
most laws against hate crimes.
“To address most of the hate incidents, we need a different type of policy solution and that includes expanded
civil rights enforcement,” he said.
A bill to reform the state's hate crime statute is pending in the Legislature and would expand the law to cover
harassment. Attorney General Maura Healey is co-sponsoring the legislation.
On Tuesday, she encouraged people to report hate crimes against Asian Americans to her office.
“Anti-Asian violence is on the rise,” she wrote. “The recent assaults on our elders are deeply disturbing.”
The state's Asian American Commission has developed a system for collecting reports about hate incidents and
has been using its online platforms to promote resources to combat the violence. Last spring, the commission
published a manual for responding to anti-Asian violence.
While several prominent activists and organizers said they haven't received reports about local Asian
communities being subjected to the same type of violence documented in California and New York, the incidents
have taken a psychological toll.
“It just adds to their level of stress,” said Ben Hires, chief executive of the Boston Chinatown Neighborhood
Center.
Boston City Councilor Ed Flynn, who represents Chinatown, said some of the neighborhood's elderly residents
worry about leaving their homes to buy food or get fresh air because they fear being harassed in public.
“We have to show more empathy to the Asian community for the very difficult year that they've had,” said
Flynn. “They need to know that we're on their side and we're going to do everything we can to be helpful when
there is discrimination and bullying and intimidation or name calling.”
One way some advocates are trying to fight anti-Asian bias is by encouraging bystanders to speak up when they
witness wrongdoing. Distrust of law enforcement, language barriers, and immigration status sometimes prevent
victims from coming forward and that's why it's important for others to step up, they said.
“A lot of the folks that are being targeted, they're not going to be able to defend themselves or they're not going
to report it so we need to the community speak up for them,” Hires said.
President Biden addressed the racism, harassment, and hate crimes directed in a video marking the Lunar New
Year.
“It's simply wrong,” he said. “It's a stain on our national character. Every person, no matter their race,
background, religion, or language they speak, deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.”
Last month, Biden signed an executive order condemning anti-Asian racism and directed the Department of

My parents live on the outskirts of Atlanta, and I am worried about them.
Since the start of the pandemic, there has been a significant uptick in hate crimes against Asians in America. In
the past few weeks, we've seen horrifying reports of Asian Americans being harassed and punched, an elderly
man thrown to the ground and killed in San Francisco, another slashed in the face and left to bleed inside a New
York City subway car, as well as countless videos of enraged people shouting at Asian Americans to go back to
their countries and even spitting in their faces.
The recent turn of events is shocking but not surprising. For many Asian Americans, anti-Asian sentiments are
borne in silence and isolation. I grew up mostly being embarrassed about my Korean heritage. In the U.S., we
Koreans have to prove that we are American, even if we were born and raised here, by pushing ourselves to
excel at school and work. As children, some of us refused to learn to speak Korean. By doing so, we shed much
of our ethnic identities.
I was always acutely aware of how I should try to fit in. When I was 4 years old, we moved to Vancouver,
Canada, where we lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. When I started elementary school in the late
1970s, many people had never heard of Korea. Another Asian girl in my class by the name of Ming Ming would
sit at the corner of one of the long lunch tables with her thermos of noodles. The other children would wince at
the smell. I did not fare better. Next to her, I would open up my doshirak, a Korean lunch box packed with fried
rice, meat and vegetables and a pair of chopsticks that fit neatly inside. Mimicking the other children, I would

Coughing is now a doubly serious concern for Asian Americans. Like everyone else, we're afraid of contracting the coronavirus. As a racial group, we have an additional fear:
being profiled as disease-carriers and being maliciously coughed at.
After news of the coronavirus broke in January, Asian Americans almost immediately experienced racial taunts on school campuses, shunning on public transit and cyberbullying
on social media. When President Trump insisted on labeling the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" in early March, these attacks became more virulent and common.
The FBI now warns of an increase of hate crimes against Asian Americans, but we've already experienced a surge.
Since the Stop-AAPI-Hate website, a project of the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action, launched on March 19 to track anti-Asian
harassment, it has received more than 1,000 reports from people in 32 states detailing verbal abuse, denial of services, discrimination on the job or physical assaults.
Several people have reported others coughing at them, including this frightening incident: ""A white man on open sidewalk approached and stepped directly in front of me and
coughed in extremely exaggerated manner in my face -- loudly, mouth wide open, about 2 feet from my face, said 'take my virus.'""
In Texas, the FBI is investigating the stabbing of a father and two children from Burma by an assailant who blamed them for the pandemic. This case harks back to the 1982
murder of Chinese American Vincent Chin, whose killers believed he was Japanese and responsible for the decline of the American auto industry.
Sadly, this kind of racist resentment is a recurring pattern in American history, particularly during health crises or in wartime.
When the bubonic plague arrived in 1900, the San Francisco Health Department quarantined that city's Chinatown with barbed wire and ropes. While white citizens were allowed
to leave, 30,000 Chinese were segregated and confined. During World War II, fear and racist hysteria led to the unconstitutional relocation and imprisonment of 120,000
Japanese Americans.

I called my parents a few nights ago to tell them to be cautious when stepping out of the house, because they might be targets of verbal or even physical abuse. It felt so
strange. Our roles had flipped.
My plea mirrored the admonitions I received from them as a child growing up in Houston. The world, they cautioned, was hostile and it viewed us as strangers. So they warned
me to stick close to my family. Close to my kind.
The fact that the coronavirus seems to have originated in China has spawned a slew of anti-Asian hate crimes. Across the country, Asian American parents and children are
making versions of the call I made. Friends are sharing first-hand accounts of abuse on text chains and circulating articles on Facebook, always ending with the suddenly
ominous ""stay safe.""
Growing up, the assumption was that once we became American enough, there would be no need for such warnings -- that we would be safe. To that end, my parents
encouraged me and my younger brother to watch as much television as possible, so that we might learn to speak and act like the natives. The hope was that race would not
disadvantage us -- the next generation -- if we played our cards right.
When I became an actor (maybe as a result of all that TV), and really started to work, I felt glimmers of my parents' hope coming to fruition -- doors were open, strangers were
kinder. In some ways, I began to lead a life devoid of race. But I've learned that a moment always comes along to remind you that your race defines you above all else.
It might be a small moment, like a salesperson greeting you with ""konnichiwa."" Or it might be a string of moments, like the press tour that Kal Penn and I took to promote
""Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle"" in 2004, a few years after 9/11.
We flew across the country -- New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Seattle -- and it became a grim routine: Flight after flight, Kal would be pulled aside for a ""random"" search. On one
leg of the tour, Kal's friend Gabe joined us, and when we hit security, Kal was selected for a search while Gabe and I flew through unscathed. We gathered our bags and waited
on a bench for Kal to be released. Rummaging through his backpack, Gabe suddenly said, ""Kal's going to be annoyed."" When I looked inside it, I realized why: Gabe, who is
white, had gone camping recently, and had neglected to remove his Rambo-sized hunting knife from his backpack.

Wearing their masks, Donalene Ferrer and two other generations of family members were walking along an Oceanside neighborhood in April when a car pulled up and a woman
yelled: ""You started the corona!""
The accuser, with a baby and a toddler in tow, turned out to be her mother's neighbor, Ferrer said. Still in shock, the victim said she stepped near the woman to ask, ""Why are
you targeting us? I'm a nurse and my father fought for this country. You shouldn't be teaching your children racism.""
Ferrer, 41, a Filipina, remembered the unmasked woman taunting them back: ""Come over here. Say it to my face."" But worried that the person might be carrying a hidden
weapon, Ferrer said, she left.
Hate incidents directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are exploding this year, according to advocates pushing for California Gov. Gavin Newsom to boost funding for
programs fighting bias and add a cultural representative to his new COVID-19 task force.
Supporters and organizers of Stop AAPI Hate have documented 832 incidents across the Golden State in the last three months, with assaults and verbal tirades ""becoming the
norm"" since the pandemic started, instigated by people following the inflammatory rhetoric of the nation's highest-profile leader, they say.
""We seem to have a president that has given the green light to the racists to come out of the woodwork and start attacking Asians,"" said state Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi (D-
Rolling Hills Estates), who represents Torrance, the scene of some the most widely viewed hate episodes recorded on video. These include a stranger, later identified as Lena
Hernandez of Long Beach, accosting an Asian woman who was exercising at Wilson Park, telling her to ""go back to whatever ... Asian country you belong in.""
On June 10, the same day at the same location, Hernandez also allegedly berated an Asian man who had parked close to her Honda, calling him ""Chinaman"" and adding: ""You
know what, you need to go home.""

Californians' perceptions of race relations in the state have shifted dramatically since the spring, with views statewide having grown significantly gloomier than they were five months ago, according to a new statewide poll.
The survey, which compares its results with a similar poll conducted in February, offers a before-and-after look at how Californians' attitudes have shifted in the aftermath of the coronavirus outbreak, George Floyd's death and the nationwide demonstrations that ensued.
Some 54% of respondents said that relations between people of different races and ethnicities in California were just fair or poor, an uptick of 13 points since February. The number of California adults who believe those relations were excellent or good dropped from 57% to 44%, the poll found. The shift, the poll indicated, occurred across racial and ethnic groups in relatively equal numbers.
White Californians are now much more likely than they were earlier this year to say that Blacks, Latinos and Asians are ""frequently"" discriminated against. The uptick comes as data have shown that the virus disproportionately affects Black and Latino communities, and has led to an explosion in anti-Asian hate incidents, said Paul Ong, director of UCLA's Center for Neighborhood Knowledge, who was not involved in the poll.
""The impacts are unevenly distributed -- whether we're talking about health, whether we're talking employment or stability or negative racial encounters,"" Ong said. ""Under COVID-19, those things have become much more visible and a lot deeper.""
The poll also found that respondents do not attribute the rising tensions to the recent protests over race and social justice.
On the contrary, most Californians, 55%, believe that protests over the deaths of Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and others have brought people in the state together, rather than splitting them further apart. A plurality of respondents described the protests as ""justified"" and ""impactful,"" at 31%, but also as ""violent"" and ""dangerous"" -- 30% and 28%, respectively.
""The categories aren't and don't have to be mutually exclusive,"" said Drew Lieberman, senior vice president at Strategies 360, the polling and research firm that conducted the survey. According to the survey, 67% of Black respondents say that they face frequent discrimination in California. And although the poll shows that whites have become more likely to acknowledge discrimination against people of color, it registered a small countertrend in the increased portion of whites who asserted that white people
face discrimination, and the number of whites who said that their racial identity is ""extremely important"" to them. Both those numbers have gone up, especially among Republicans and supporters of President Trump.
Respondents took part online in the California Community Poll from June 26 through July 6. The survey was commissioned by the Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment, Hispanas Organized for Political Equality and the Los Angeles Urban League in consultation with The Times. Strategies 360 polled 1,184 adult citizens. The margin of sampling error is 3 percentage points.
In addition to taking the pulse on race in the aftermath of nationwide protests, the poll also exposed the manner in which the COVID-19 pandemic ""colors everything else that's going on right now,"" Lieberman said.
The poll also found that a majority of Californians believe police treat Black people unfairly and perceive systemic racism in law enforcement -- a question that was not part of the February survey. Respondents were more divided on how police treat Latinos (46% believe Latinos are treated fairly, while 48% believe they are treated unfairly) and believe that police treat Asians and whites mostly fairly.
And while nearly all of those surveyed support police reform, Californians are divided on which reforms they support. Some 6% would abolish police departments and shift their funding and responsibilities to other agencies, while 12% would leave departments as they are and ensure they have the equipment and funding they need to do their jobs properly.
An additional 45% support more accountability and training, and 32% would go further to shift significant parts of police funding and responsibilities to other agencies while maintaining their role in handling violent crime.
""We're facing a lot of these conversations, not because they're new, but because of environment,"" said Helen Torres, executive director of Hispanas Organized for Political Equality. ""There's huge racial inequalities in our communities and our society, and that creates frustration across the board.""
The data show substantial racial gaps on police reform, with Black respondents most likely to favor shifting funding and responsibilities away from police and whites least likely to endorse such major reforms.
Just over 45% of Black respondents say they would shift funds away from police, while 34% of Latinos and 28% of whites feel that way.
Police reform ""is at the heart of a lot of the discussions that are going on,"" said Michael Lawson, president of the Los Angeles Urban League.
""It is at the core of what Black Lives Matter is demanding, and is an essential part of moving forward,"" Lawson said. ""There have been discussions going back to the Rodney King situation. This is a continuation of that.""
The recent spate of police killings of unarmed Black Americans and subsequent protests has also led to a change in perceptions on discrimination, he added.
""The visibility of people standing in the streets and saying, 'Enough is enough,' is a big change,"" he said. ""There is something different. The needle has moved.""
Compared with February, white respondents are 18 percentage points more likely to believe Black Americans are discriminated against frequently (from 22% saying as much in February to 40%), 10 points more likely to believe Latinos are discriminated against frequently (from 22% to 32%), and 13 points more likely to believe Asians are discriminated against frequently (from 7% to 20%).
There is a ""continuing hierarchy"" in which respondents perceive Black Americans to be the most affected by discrimination, followed by Latinos and Asian Americans, Ong noted.
Charlie Woo, the board chair of the Center for Asian Americans United for Self Empowerment, said it was important for Californians to understand that Asian Americans are also discriminated against.
""People need to be aware of the challenges we face,"" Woo said. ""The fact that Californians [now] recognize Asian Americans don't just fit in as model minorities, but also are discriminated against and face challenges ... that's big progress.""

An incident involving a man leaving a box containing a mutilated cat carcass outside an Asian family-run butcher shop in Sacramento is being investigated as a possible hate crime, authorities said.
Caught on video surveillance tape, the incident occurred Monday evening outside Mad Butcher Meat Co., whose owners are of Chinese descent, according to the Sacramento Police Department, which is investigating the incident as a possible bias or hate-related crime.
""Not only was an animal violently abused, but it was used to threaten and provoke fear at an Asian American-owned business in Sacramento,"" Councilwoman Mai Vang said. ""Our city has committed to racial equity and justice -- which means confronting the perpetrators of hate and acknowledging the trauma and suffering experienced by victims.""
The owners of Mad Butcher Meat Co. posted on the shop's social media page that they were ""shaken and especially disappointed"" by the incident.
""It is impossible for us to fully discuss this incident without feeling an overwhelming amount of emotion,"" they said.
The shop -- owned by Michael and Diana Shum's family for more than 30 years -- thanked the community for the ""calls, hugs, support, and community organizing"" in a social media post Wednesday. ""We are very blessed to have you guys as our family.""
The incident comes amid a string of attacks on Asians and Asian Americans, many of them against people who are elderly or otherwise vulnerable.
Oakland's Chinatown has been the scene of a series of attacks and thefts that have left the community on edge.
California lawmakers approved on Monday $1.4 million in one-time funding to support academic efforts to report and track anti-Asian incidents, which have surged nationwide since the COVID-19 pandemic began last year.

Every night, the neighbors converge on the Si family's two-story home, which has large windows and an expansive porch adorned with columns.
Some sit in camping chairs in front of the driveway. Others keep watch from their cars or patrol the nearby parks.
The Sis moved to this upscale Ladera Ranch neighborhood a few months ago, with the country deep in the COVID-19 pandemic and hate crimes against Asian Americans on the rise.
Almost immediately, teenagers swooped in for nightly visits, repeatedly ringing the doorbell, yelling and pounding on the door.
One told Haijun Si to ""go back to your country."" Another called Si's wife a pejorative slur used to describe a Chinese person. Some threw rocks.
Sometimes, the interruptions came just as the family sat down for dinner.
Other times, Si's 8-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son were jarred awake at midnight.
Si and his wife took turns standing guard outside. They installed a new fence and cameras. They called the police.
But the attacks kept coming -- until their new neighbors stepped in.
""I did not understand the extent of the harassment and how often it was occurring, at first,"" said Layla Parks, who organized the nightly neighborhood watch. ""I was immediately outraged and wanted to help.""
Violence and hate incidents directed at Asian Americans have surged across California, including in Orange County, since the beginning of the pandemic, with some blaming Asians because of the coronavirus' origins in Wuhan, China.
A recent spate of violent attacks in Oakland, San Francisco, New York City and elsewhere has attracted national attention and sparked fear among Asian Americans, though it is unclear whether some of the incidents were racially motivated.
In February in Koreatown, two men hurled anti-Asian slurs at a 27-year-old Korean American U.S. Air Force veteran, calling him ""Chinese virus"" and then swinging at him, he told KTLA.
""We're seeing an epidemic of hate right now, and we have to stand together,"" state Sen. Dave Min (D-Irvine), who represents the district just west of Ladera Ranch, said last week at an event to show support for the Si family.
While officials in Orange County are still compiling information on reports made in 2020, preliminary statistics indicate a tenfold increase in hate incidents against Asian Americans, said Alison Edwards, chief executive of the nonprofit OC Human Relations.
It's a troubling uptick that experts have blamed in part on Donald Trump's rhetoric about the pandemic, including his use of terms such as ""China virus"" and ""kung flu.""
Last year, California saw a consistent increase in hate incidents and crimes targeting Asian Americans, said Brian Levin, executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino.
Stereotyping and conspiracy theories identifying Asians as responsible for COVID-19 have been embraced by wide swaths of the country, Levin said, with a new Center for Public Integrity/Ipsos poll showing that nearly 1 in 4 Americans have concerns about being physically near Asian people.
A ""catalytic event"" like the pandemic, with stereotyping by political and social influencers acting as an accelerant, often leads to increased targeting of racial groups, Levin said.
The attacks against the Si family fit another pattern -- the homes of minority residents tend to be targeted by neighbors in certain age groups, Levin said.
""The most common offenders of these residential crimes are turf-oriented youths with moderate prejudices out for a thrill or older neighbors reacting to a perceived threat or change,"" Levin said.
The Si family arrived in the U.S. from China four years ago. In September, the family moved to Ladera Ranch from Corona, looking to escape the Inland Empire heat and attracted by the planned community's lush trees, neatly manicured lawns and parks.
Ladera Ranch is a friendly place, where neighbors frequently share meals or spend evenings chatting on the sidewalk as their kids play.
But, some residents say, there is a dark side to the unincorporated community of about 30,000 residents, which is about two-thirds white, 14% Latino and 13% Asian.
After the attacks started, Si installed a $3,000 wrought-iron fence around his front porch and placed floodlights and cameras around the property.
He hung a heavy chain across his driveway to keep the teens from riding their bikes up to his door.
""My kids are scared. I'm very annoyed,"" said Si, 48. ""At night, my wife and I could not sleep for more than three or four hours. Please, parents, tell your kids don't do that again.""
The Orange County Sheriff's Department has been called to the home seven times between October and February. Deputies have ramped up patrols in the area, and the department has launched an investigation, Sgt. Dennis Breckner said.
Still, the doorbell kept ringing, Si said. Nothing helped until his neighbors stepped in, vowing to put an end to the harassment.
Parks, who takes daily walks around the neighborhood, had introduced herself to Si and his family when she noticed them moving in last year.
In early February, Si reached out to Parks for advice. He had already told her about the constant doorbell ringing, and she had offered to help if needed.
At first, she figured it was a harmless childhood prank of ""ding-dong ditch.""
But as the harassment continued, including racial slurs against the family, Parks realized this was something uglier.
""It makes me physically ill,"" said Parks, 30. ""This has opened my eyes to the racism that is alive and well in Ladera Ranch. It's definitely made me sad for this community, because this is just a wonderful place full of friends and neighbors that love and care about each other.""
On a neighborhood Facebook group, Parks posted footage from Si of a recent attack and sought volunteers to guard the family's home. She wanted coverage from 6 p.m. until at least midnight. Neighbors signed up in droves.
""I got involved because I'm raising a young child here. I don't want to put a 'for sale' sign in front of my house and say, 'I can't deal with this,' "" said Emily Lippincott, 40, who lives nearby in Rancho Mission Viejo. ""I kept seeing excuses being made, 'Oh, it's just kids being kids.' No, this is months of terrorizing this poor family.""
Neighbors estimate that from 15 to 20 children have participated in the harassment, one as young as 10.
Three children have apologized, Si said. But Parks said one family sent a cease-and-desist letter after seeing their child in security video she posted on Facebook. The letter threatened her with a lawsuit if she didn't remove her post.
As the sun began to set on a recent Thursday, Parks stood outside the Sis' home, where Loden Pass curves onto Mocha Lane, assembling her troops. She kept close watch on a cluster of teenagers riding bicycles on the trails on a hillside overlooking the home.
""This is what we do all night,"" Parks said. ""We see kids and we go 'OK, are they good or are they bad?' Are they coming this way?""
Two neighbors bundled up in coats to ward off the evening chill, grabbed flashlights and took their posts on top of the hill near the home.
Others stationed themselves around the neighborhood.
""I'm so thankful for my neighbors,"" Si said.
In the two weeks or so since the volunteers have been protecting the home, the harassment has lessened, but the teens haven't been completely deterred.
One evening, a group threw rocks at Si and volunteers who were chatting on the front lawn. Sometimes they yell profanities, neighbors said.
The next day, as Chinese families around the world celebrated the Lantern Festival, hundreds of residents gathered on the grassy lawn across the street to show their support.
People held red lanterns and watched a traditional lion dance performance. Young children danced and clapped along to the music.
Min, the state senator, said the Si family should not have been made to feel unsafe and unwelcome in their own home.
""The fact of the matter is -- as we see tonight -- we outnumber them,"" Min told the crowd.

202004,"
My parents live on the outskirts of Atlanta, and I am worried about them.
Since the start of the pandemic, there has been a significant uptick in hate crimes against Asians in America. In the past few weeks, we've seen horrifying reports of Asian Americans being harassed and punched, an elderly man thrown to the ground and killed in San Francisco, another slashed in the face and left to bleed inside a New York City subway car, as well as countless videos of enraged people shouting at Asian Americans to go back to their countries and even spitting in their faces.
The recent turn of events is shocking, but not surprising. For many Asian Americans, anti-Asian sentiments are borne in silence and isolation. I grew up mostly being embarrassed about my Korean heritage. In the U.S., we Koreans have to prove that we are American, even if we were born and raised here, by pushing ourselves to excel at school and work. As children, some of us refused to learn to speak Korean. By doing so, we shed much of our ethnic identities.
I was always acutely aware of how I should try to fit in. When I was 4 years old, we moved to Vancouver, Canada, where we lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. When I started elementary school in the late 1970s, many people had never heard of Korea. Another Asian girl in my class by the name of Ming Ming would sit at the corner of one of the long lunch tables with her thermos of noodles. The other children would wince at the smell. I did not fare better. Next to her, I would open up my doshirak, a
Korean lunch box packed with fried rice, meat and vegetables and a pair of chopsticks that fit neatly inside. Mimicking the other children, I would scrunch up my nose at my own lunchbox and pretend that its contents were equally offensive to me.
When I got home, I cornered my mother. Why couldn't she just pack me a normal lunch like peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches?
""How is that even healthy?"" my mother countered. ""There are no vegetables in there!"" But my mother obliged, and to my relief, I was sent to school with a Western-styled sandwich.
One of my mother's favorite words in Korean is cham-ah, meaning to endure. It is what she and her family had to do when they escaped North Korea during the winter of 1950. Traveling on foot from Pyongyang to Seoul, they crossed icy rivers and ran for cover from bombings and artillery fire before riding on the roof of a U.S. military cargo train from Seoul to Daegu.
My parents arrived in Los Angeles in the 1970s and worked as janitors at the Shubert Theater, saving money to buy their first grocery store in a Spanish-speaking neighborhood. Unable to secure a permanent visa for our family, we moved to Canada, where they cleaned fish at a local market and bought a hardware store. When my mom got her medical technologist certification, she found a job in New York and we moved back to the States. Through all of their struggles to make ends meet, they instilled in us
the concept of enduring. If someone mistreated us, we were told not to make a fuss. Cham-ah. When my schoolteacher told my parents that my Korean name was too difficult to pronounce, they consulted our church minister, who provided us with Americanized names. Giving up our Korean names was a small price to pay to fit in. Cham-ah.
Even today, I will rarely speak out when someone throws out a racial slur. I think to myself, is it really worth it? It could be so much worse. Cham-ah. At the counter of a sandwich shop, the woman who rings me up says very loudly with exaggerated enunciation how much my order costs, holding up seven fingers, in case I might be hearing impaired in addition to not understanding English. Cham-ah.
All my life I felt like being Asian in America was a shortcoming I had to make up for by working hard and not sticking out too much. This week, this low-grade anxiety has morphed into actual fear. Fear for my aging parents, relatives and their friends.
I am hoping the coming herd immunity against the coronavirus might bring with it a new era of racial tolerance. That vanquishing COVID-19 might also mean diminishing these racial attacks, particularly on our elders whom we have been raised to respect and honor. But we can't wait for that to happen. It is time to speak up about anti-Asian hate crimes.

202004,"
Hate crimes against Asian Americans and other members of the Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Los Angeles rose sharply in 2020, mirroring a national trend and causing concern among police and local advocacy organizations.
According to a report presented to the Los Angeles Police Commission on Tuesday, there were 15 anti-Asian hate crimes reported in the city in 2020, compared with seven in 2019, marking a 114% increase.
There were also nine hate ""incidents"" -- or bigoted encounters that don't rise to the level of a crime -- compared with seven in 2019, police said. Several anti-Asian hate crimes have occurred so far this year.
Police and advocates said they believe many more incidents occur than are reported, and that they are working to better identify, track and record such encounters and conduct more outreach in local Asian communities to encourage reporting by victims.
They say the recent hate has been fueled in part by misguided notions of blame for the COVID-19 pandemic, in which early cases arose in China. They said such hatred has at times been spurred by national political figures like former President Trump, and it is up to local leaders to push back.
""Unfortunately we're a year into this pandemic and we are starting to see again a rise in anti-Asian hate and some very violent attacks that have occurred in our community in the last month or two,"" said Connie Chung Joe, CEO of the group Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Los Angeles.
She cited among other incidents a Korean American U.S. military veteran recently being attacked in Koreatown. She also said she had spoken to a woman who was harassed at a bar but told by police that they couldn't do anything about it other than offer to walk her to her car.
She said many incidents are going unreported, in part because of language barriers in immigrant communities, and called on the LAPD to increase training for officers to know ""how to identify when a crime rises to the level of a hate crime and report it accordingly so that the public gets a full report on the severity of the problem.""
""When victims are brave enough to come forward and share their experiences with the police, having the police say that nothing can be done discourages victims and their communities from relying on the police again,"" she said. ""This contributes to the underreporting problem.""
Michael Lawson, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, said victims are also discouraged from reporting such crimes when they perceive or see bias being espoused by officers.
Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and cofounder of Stop AAPI Hate, said her group has tracked thousands of crimes and other incidents targeting members of Asian and Pacific Islander communities nationwide and what is occurring in Los Angeles seems to mirror the broader trend.
San Francisco police said Tuesday that, based on preliminary data for 2020, hate crimes against Asian Americans rose from six in 2019 to nine in 2020.
The Orange County Sheriff's Department did not respond to a request for 2020 hate crime data Tuesday, but Alison Edwards, chief executive of the nonprofit OC Human Relations, said preliminary data indicated a tenfold increase in hate incidents against Asian Americans.
Brian Levin, executive director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at Cal State San Bernardino, said such incidents increased across the state.
Police and other service providers, including those whose job it is to ensure civil rights aren't violated, must intervene to turn the tide, Kulkarni said.
LAPD Asst. Chief Beatrice Girmala said the department has increased training on hate incidents in recent years, including input from an LGBTQ working group, and takes hate crimes seriously.
Girmala said the department would be hosting a forum soon to discuss issues specific to the Asian and Pacific Islander communities and asked community leaders to work with her to ensure that victims who contact the police have access to additional resources such as counseling.
""We do not stand for or tolerate any acts of violence, any behavior that seeks to promote or give a so-called safe haven to those who promote hate,"" Girmala said.
Within the department, Girmala said, Chief Michel Moore has made it clear that officers who exhibit their own biases will be dealt with severely.
""His highest priority is a zero tolerance for any type of behavior that is bias driven, that may even have the appearance of being bias driven, in any manner, shape or form,"" Girmala said.
In addition to anti-Asian crimes, hate crimes against other groups also increased last year. Anti-Hispanic hate crimes rose nearly 36%, to 57 incidents in 2020, and anti-Black hate crimes rose more than 5%, to 77, the LAPD's report found.
Hate crimes against gay men jumped nearly 30%, to 70 crimes in 2020, and anti-transgender hate crimes rose about 26%, to 29 incidents last year.
Hate crimes against the Jewish community declined.
Members of the Police Commission said they stand against hate and will continue to monitor the data and do what they can to ensure that police are trained to identify such incidents when they occur and respond to them appropriately.
""It will not be tolerated,"" said Commissioner William Briggs, of hate-fueled crime in L.A. ""We need to take positive steps as a community and as a police force to help stem this tide of hatred.""

202004,"
A 91-year-old man shoved to the ground in Oakland's Chinatown. A dead cat left at a family-run butcher shop in Sacramento. A teacher's aide beaten with his own cane in Rosemead. A fire and vandalism at a Buddhist temple in Little Tokyo. The harassment of an immigrant family in Ladera Ranch. A Sacramento high school teacher making disparaging slant-eyed gestures during a Zoom call.
These horrific incidents all occurred within the last month. And the trend isn't limited to California. Attacks on Asian Americans have drawn an outcry in New York City as well. Voice of America has documented similar surges in hate crimes in Boston, Seattle and other cities.
The increase in attacks over the last year has no single cause. But there can be no doubt that former President Trump's invective against immigrants and against China -- he repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as ""the Chinese virus"" -- contributed to an atmosphere of xenophobia and scapegoating. It is only the latest in a long and ugly history of hostility toward Asians, marked by such outrages as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II.
Today, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are the fastest-growing minority group in America. The community is characterized by staggering diversity.
One of the few things that unites this group's members, sadly, is being the target of hate crimes. The anti-Asian violence does not discriminate by national origin; for example, a 27-year-old Korean American was assaulted last month in Koreatown by two men who allegedly accused him of carrying COVID-19 and told him to ""go back to China."" Or consider Vincent Chin, a Chinese American, who was beaten to death in 1982 by autoworkers angry about economic competition from Japan.
That's one reason Trump's tough-on-China rhetoric was so harmful. As China continues to grow in wealth and influence, so too does mistrust in the United States -- some of it justified -- about the Chinese regime's intentions. But as the persecution of German Americans in World War I and Japanese Americans in World War II shows, rivalry with a foreign power can easily spill over into terrible abuses at home.
There is some good news. The recently enacted California pandemic aid bill includes $1.4 million to support research by the Asian American Studies Center at UCLA and data reporting by Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of advocacy groups established a year ago to collect information on racially motivated violence and harassment. Hate crimes have been underreported because many Asian Americans have limited English proficiency or do not trust the police.
It's also good that activists and entertainers, such as Daniel Dae Kim, have spoken out against anti-Asian hate. But more leadership will be needed to prevent this latest trend from getting worse -- or turning deadly.

202004,"
A rise in hate crimes toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to send an email to the entire organization decrying the wave of bullying and violence as ""cowardice.""
Roberts, the son of a Japanese mother and Black father, said the email, the contents of which were first reported by the Athletic on Monday, was prompted not by a specific event but by ""something that was on my heart that needed to be shared."" The five-paragraph note was sent earlier this spring.
""I just think there's a lot of things going on inside and outside of our country toward Asians -- racist, bullying acts,"" Roberts said before Monday's exhibition game against the Chicago White Sox at Camelback Ranch.
""It obviously hit close to home for me, and I wanted to address it internally and show my support for the Asian Americans in our organization ... just [to let them know] we're all aware of it.""
The Times reported last week that in a survey of police departments in 16 major U.S. cities, the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, a research office at Cal State San Bernardino, found a total of 122 anti-Asian hate crimes last year -- a 149% increase from the 49 in 2019.
The numbers climbed in 15 of the 16 cities, with New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle and San Jose experiencing the most significant increases and their highest tallies in at least five years.
The rise in crimes, harassment and bigotry toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is almost certainly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in China and which former President Trump took to calling the ""Wuhan virus"" and the ""Chinese virus.""
Stop AAPI Hate, a tracker supported by Asian American advocacy groups, logged 1,990 anti-Asian harassment incidents and 246 assault cases in the first 10 months since it launched in March 2020.
""Unfortunately, anti-Asian sentiment is a part of American history (see 1880s, 1940s or the 1980s as examples) and it has resurfaced again during the pandemic, as some seem to blame the world's problems on one ethnic group,"" Roberts wrote in his email. ""To blame Asian Americans at all for the global pandemic is just plain wrong.""
Roberts, who last summer supported his team's refusal to play an August game against the San Francisco Giants in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Wisconsin, wrote that he was ""proud that the Dodgers organization, with its forward-thinking ways, has transformed its work environment by establishing better ways for all employees to be heard.""
He said Monday that his email was well-received throughout the organization.
""I think a lot of people felt heard and supported, and that was really important to me,"" Roberts said. ""It's not right treating anyone of any race that way.""

202004,"
It was the sound of a car door slamming that caught Stella Hwang's attention as she waited in the ride-share pickup area of Los Angeles International Airport on Tuesday.
""You Asian piece of s--,"" she heard the man yell at his Uber driver, she said. ""You probably don't have papers to even be here.""
The driver, she said, appeared to be in a state of shock. Hwang sprang into action.
""Obviously there was a language barrier with the Uber driver, so I came to his defense,"" she said. ""Because that's what I'm supposed to do as a human being.""
Hwang caught the tail end of the encounter on video, which she posted on Twitter. ""I hope this is not your f-- example because the world doesn't operate like this!"" she can be heard yelling at the passenger, who is wearing a cap advertising a baseball scouting service and carrying a large sports trophy.
""Let me guess,"" he responds. ""You're not married.""
The man then approaches her and jabs his finger in her face, telling her the dispute is none of her business. She addresses two children accompanying him who appear to be his sons, saying, ""Boys, I hope you don't turn out like him.""
""Hey, go get a husband,"" the man retorts before walking away.
""What does me having a husband have to do with anything?"" Hwang said Saturday. ""Does he think a woman needs to be accompanied by a man to speak up for what's right?""
The incident was apparently touched off when the man, whom other media outlets have identified but whose name Uber has not publicly confirmed, attempted to sit in the front seat of the Uber vehicle and became irate when the driver told him to get in the back. Uber confirmed that sitting in the front seat violates policies put in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus and said it has reached out to the driver to offer support.
The man and one of his sons, whose account he's believed to have used to book the ride, have been banned from the Uber app.
""We are shocked and saddened by the recent increase in anti-Asian hate, particularly when it affects a driver or rider,"" Uber said in a statement.
An airport police officer responded to the dispute, Hwang said, but spoke with the man first. She didn't hear their conversation, but she did hear the officer tell the Uber driver to leave, she said.
""When he approached me, he didn't bother asking for my name or if I wanted to file a report,"" she said. The officer told her not to engage with the man and then departed, she said.
The Los Angeles Airport Police Department confirmed an officer was flagged down about 6:30 p.m. for ""two individuals speaking in raised tones"" but said neither person wanted to pursue a citizen's arrest.
""In accordance with the law involving misdemeanor incidents not in the presence of an officer, no further action was required by APD,"" the department said in a statement. ""Both parties continued with their plans separately.""
Most disappointing, Hwang said, was that there were plenty of other people around but she was the only one who came to the driver's aid.
She also noted that the man's social media pages list him as co-founder of an organization that teaches baseball to children. Neither the individual nor the organization, a sports academy in San Diego, returned messages seeking comment Saturday.
""If he feels comfortable displaying this type of behavior in front of his two sons, I can't imagine for him to be around the number of kids that play baseball and are in the program,"" Hwang said. ""Hate is taught. And if somebody with that type of power is in that type of space, we're not moving anywhere.""
The attack comes amid a sharp rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans and other members of the Asian and Pacific Islander communities in Los Angeles, mirroring a national trend.
Police on Tuesday arrested one of several women who they say assaulted a San Francisco Uber driver, tearing off his mask, coughing on him and dousing him with pepper spray. The driver, a Nepali immigrant, has said he believes he was targeted because of his race.
A woman accused of spitting on an Asian American man and yelling an ethnic slur as he dined outdoors in Silicon Valley was charged last week with a misdemeanor hate crime and battery.
In Southern California, a 51-year-old elementary school teacher's aide was beaten with his own cane at a Rosemead bus stop, causing him to lose part of a finger. And in Orange County, neighbors in a Ladera Ranch subdivision have been taking turns watching over an Asian family's home after repeated harassment.
The continued attacks prompted more than 100 people to gather at Irvine City Hall on Saturday for a noontime rally. The event, organized by an ad hoc committee called Stand for Asians Solidarity and featuring speeches by politicians and advocates, was intended to raise awareness and inspire action, said organizer Jerry Raburn.
""I immigrated to this country at 9 years old for the American dream, only to lose that dream because of the structural racism we faced when I was growing up,"" Raburn said. ""I want to end the racism and stop the scapegoating of our community.""
He said that in order to address systemic racism, it's crucial to dismantle the harmful ""model minority"" myth, which he described as ""the stereotypes that Asians are successful, that they don't face racism, that they're good Americans.""
Experts say the recent hate has been fueled in part by misguided notions of blame for the COVID-19 pandemic and at times encouraged by national figures such as former President Trump, who insisted on using terms like ""China virus.""
Before she started filming her encounter with the man at the airport, Hwang said, he made his political views clear. ""He said, 'You probably voted for Biden,' which I felt as though had nothing to do with anything,"" she said.
""So my response was, you obviously voted for Trump. His response was, 'You're damn right.' ""

202004,"
Since coronavirus shutdowns began last March, thousands of Asian Americans have faced racist verbal and physical attacks or have been shunned by others, according to a study released Tuesday.
The report by Stop AAPI Hate documents 3,795 racially motivated attacks against Asian Americans from March to February, noting that the number is likely a fraction of the attacks that occurred, because many were not reported to the group.
Stop AAPI Hate formed last March in response to attacks related to the perception that Asians were responsible for the coronavirus because of its origins in Wuhan, China. The group did not collect data in previous years to show whether attacks against Asians have increased during the pandemic.
About 68% of the anti-Asian incidents documented in the study were verbal harassment, 21% were shunning and 11% were physical assaults.
About 9% of the incidents were civil rights violations such as workplace discrimination or being refused service at a business. Nearly 7% were online harassment.
Most of the incidents occurred at businesses or on public streets.
More than two-thirds of the attacks in the study were reported by women.
More than 40% were reported by Chinese Americans, 15% by Korean Americans and 8% by Filipino Americans.
""We ask policymakers at the local, state and national level to partner with us on implementing community-based solutions that will help ensure Asian Americans have equal rights and access to opportunities,"" said Manjusha Kulkarni, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.
The report includes descriptions of the incidents provided by victims.
At a subway station in Annandale, Va., an Asian American woman was on an escalator when a man repeatedly punched her in the back and followed her, fake-coughing and shouting ""Chinese b--.""
In August, Hong Lee was waiting for tacos at a restaurant in the Pico-Union area when a stranger approached her, handed her his business card and asked her to lunch.
She said she was married and declined.
Then, she said in an interview with The Times, ""the man started screaming at me, telling me to go back to Asia, followed by two minutes of calling me every single derogatory word you could imagine.""
Lee, a Vietnamese American nonprofit worker in her mid-30s, remembered feeling cornered by the man and ""asking for help, but no one stepped up.""
Finally, an employee asked the man to move to the other side of the room. He collected his food and walked out, Lee said.
A police officer refused to take an incident report because ""he said, 'This happens all the time and there's nothing I can do,' "" she recalled. ""He said there's no crime here.""
Lee, a mother of two, talked with her Korean American husband about whether to publicize what happened to her. She decided to encourage others ""not to take this quietly.""
Her video of the incident, which she posted on Instagram and Facebook, went viral. She now volunteers as an ambassador for Los Angeles County's ""L.A. vs. Hate"" campaign, connecting victims to social services and mental health resources.
She also reported the incident to Stop AAPI Hate.
""It's in our culture just to keep our heads down, and we don't want to talk about things that humiliate us,"" she said. ""But why do we need to be passive?""
Attacks against senior citizens in the Bay Area and New York City have intensified the outcry against anti-Asian hate crimes, though it is unclear whether many of those incidents were racially motivated.
""We need to reckon with both the historical and ongoing impact that racism, hate and violence are having on our community, especially on women, youth and seniors, who are particularly vulnerable,"" said Cynthia Choi, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.
Choi and others appealed to the public to report hate attacks.
Russell Jeung, a Stop AAPI Hate co-founder and professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, referred to former President Trump's use of the terms ""kung flu"" and ""China virus.""
Hatred against Asian Americans should not ""be a legacy of COVID-19 or the last presidential administration,"" Jeung said.
About 4 in 10 Asian Americans said people have acted uncomfortable around them because of their race since the pandemic started, and 31% said they have been subjected to racial slurs or jokes, according to a Pew Research Center study.
In Los Angeles, hate crimes against Asians and Pacific Islanders surged in 2020.
Advocates and law enforcement officials say many more incidents occur than are reported.
After Lee publicized her case, five other women came forward describing a similar attacker, who is now under investigation.
""There's no sense in staying silent,"" Lee said. ""No one should stay fearful.""

Disease and prejudice have long gone hand in hand. We can do better in 2020.
We’ve been down this road before, too many times. In the 14th century the Black Death provoked mass violence against Jews, Catalans, clerics and beggars; when syphilis
spread in the 15th century, it was called variously the Neapolitan, French, Polish and German disease, depending on who was pointing the blame; when the plague struck
Honolulu in 1899, officials burned down Chinatown. And so on, down to our times, when epidemics like Ebola, SARS and Zika fueled animus toward specific regions or peoples.
Here we are in 2020, with Asians being assailed across the United States and around the world as purported sources of the “Chinese flu,” the “Wuhan coronavirus” or simply the
“foreign virus.” Once again, a mysterious, fast-spreading and sometimes lethal disease is exacerbating racism and hatred — only now with the help of the potent megaphone of
social media.
As the coronavirus has spread from its beachhead in Wuhan, China, old anti-Asian prejudices have spread with it, from the “Yellow Peril” canard that led to the lynching of
Chinese in the 1870s to stereotypes of Chinese as dirty and decrepit.
As The Times reported on Monday, Chinese-Americans and other Asians lumped together with them by racists are being beaten, spat on, yelled at and insulted from coast to
coast, driving some members of the maligned minority to purchase firearms in the fear of worse to come as the pandemic deepens.
The United States is not alone in this blight of xenophobia. Japan’s Kyodo News agency described similar incidents of anti-Asian bigotry wherever the coronavirus has struck:
Asian students pelted with eggs in Leicestershire, England, or people in Egypt yelling out “corona” when passing Asians in the street. Vile posts on social media have made
graphic threats in rants against Asians over the coronavirus.
However much mystery still surrounds the coronavirus, these are not the Dark Ages, and there really should be no reason to remind people that this terrible new virus makes no
distinction among races or nations. Though it makes good medical sense to keep a distance from people who have been to an area with a high rate of infection — which today is
effectively anywhere — it is foolish and malicious to hold the Chinese (or any other) people responsible for the spread of the virus, or to assume that they are somehow more
likely to be its carriers.
A time of great fear and danger requires solidarity, humanity, sacrifice and hope, and not hysteria or hatred. That should be the message of the world’s political, social, religious
and corporate leaders as they race to find ways to cope with the lethal virus. Many leaders have done just that.
It is more than unfortunate, then, that President Trump, some members of his cabinet and some conservative politicians have opted to fan the bigotry by deliberately using the
term “Wuhan virus” or “Chinese virus.” Mr. Trump, who spent previous months calling it the coronavirus, started defending the use of “Chinese virus” last week. Photographs of
a text of the speech he was reading seemed to show “Corona” lined out and “Chinese” written in the president’s hand. Mr. Trump tweeted support of the Asian-American
community on Monday, but his many supporters online had already embraced his formulation.
In tying the virus to China, the president has also adopted the argument of Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, that referring to Wuhan or China is payback for Chinese
disinformation and for Beijing’s delay in letting the world know of the outbreak. Of course, it is possible to hold the Chinese government accountable for its handling of the crisis
and its spread of misinformation without maligning a nation of more than 1.3 billion people or the people of Chinese descent who make their homes in nations around the world.
The xenophobia and prejudices that result from naming new infectious diseases after places, people or animals are the reasons the World Health Organization has urged against
doing so, and instead using generic descriptive terms like “coronavirus.” Names like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, Spanish flu, swine flu or monkey pox, the W.H.O. said,
can have serious consequences, whether provoking a backlash against members of a particular community or prompting needless slaughter of food animals.
In the end, though, the anti-Asian hatreds spread by the coronavirus are not solely the product of politics, but of the deep fears that have always accompanied the outbreak of
lethal pathogens. It is for all Americans to try, in whatever ways they can, to remain united and compassionate as the disease invades all facets of our lives.

202004,"
As bigots blame them for the coronavirus and President Trump labels it the ""Chinese virus,"" many Chinese-Americans say they are terrified of what could come next.
WASHINGTON -- Yuanyuan Zhu was walking to her gym in San Francisco on March 9, thinking the workout could be her last for a while, when she noticed that a man
was shouting at her. He was yelling an expletive about China. Then a bus passed, she recalled, and he screamed after it, ""Run them over.""
She tried to keep her distance, but when the light changed, she was stuck waiting with him at the crosswalk. She could feel him staring at her. And then, suddenly, she
felt it: his saliva hitting her face and her favorite sweater.
In shock, Ms. Zhu, who is 26 and moved to the United States from China five years ago, hurried the rest of the way to the gym. She found a corner where no one could
see her, and she cried quietly.
""That person didn't look strange or angry or anything, you know?"" she said of her tormentor. ""He just looked like a normal person.""
As the coronavirus upends American life, Chinese-Americans face a double threat. Not only are they grappling like everyone else with how to avoid the virus itself, they
are also contending with growing racism in the form of verbal and physical attacks. Other Asian-Americans -- with families from Korea, Vietnam, the Philippines,
Myanmar and other places -- are facing threats, too, lumped together with Chinese-Americans by a bigotry that does not know the difference.
In interviews over the past week, nearly two dozen Asian-Americans across the country said they were afraid -- to go grocery shopping, to travel alone on subways or
buses, to let their children go outside. Many described being yelled at in public -- a sudden spasm of hate that is reminiscent of the kind faced by American Muslims and
other Arabs and South Asians after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
But unlike in 2001, when President George W. Bush urged tolerance of American Muslims, this time President Trump is using language that Asian-Americans say is
inciting racist attacks.
Mr. Trump and his Republican allies are intent on calling the coronavirus ""the Chinese virus,"" rejecting the World Health Organization's guidance against using geographic
locations when naming illnesses, since past names have provoked a backlash.
Mr. Trump told reporters on Tuesday that he was calling the virus ""Chinese"" to combat a disinformation campaign by Beijing officials saying the American military was
the source of the outbreak. He dismissed concerns that his language would lead to any harm.
On Monday evening, Mr. Trump tweeted, ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States."" He added they should not be
blamed for the pandemic, though he did not comment on his use of the phrase ""Chinese virus.""
""If they keep using these terms, the kids are going to pick it up,"" said Tony Du, an epidemiologist in Howard County, Md., who fears for his son, Larry. ""They are going to
call my 8-year-old son a Chinese virus. It's serious.""
Mr. Du said he posted on Facebook that ""this is the darkest day in my 20-plus years of life in the United States,"" referring to Mr. Trump's doubling down on use of the
term.
While no firm numbers exist yet, Asian-American advocacy groups and researchers say there has been a surge of verbal and physical assaults reported in newspapers
and to tip lines.
San Francisco State University found a 50 percent rise in the number of news articles related to the coronavirus and anti-Asian discrimination between Feb. 9 and March
7. The lead researcher, Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian-American studies, said the figures represented ""just the tip of the iceberg"" because only the most egregious

https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
2/3
cases would be likely to be reported by the media.
Professor Jeung has helped set up a website in six Asian languages to gather firsthand accounts; some 150 cases have been reported on the site since it was started last
Thursday.
Benny Luo, founder and chief executive of NextShark, a website focused on Asian-American news, said the site used to get a few tips a day. Now it is dozens.
""We've never received this many news tips about racism against Asians,"" he said. ""It's crazy. My staff is pulling double duty just to keep up."" He said he was hiring two
more people to help.
No one is immune to being targeted. Dr. Edward Chew, the head of the emergency department at a large Manhattan hospital, is on the front lines of fighting the
coronavirus. He said that over the past few weeks, he had noticed people trying to cover their nose and mouth with their shirts when they are near him.
Dr. Chew has been using his free time to buy protective gear, like goggles and face shields, for his staff in case his hospital runs out. On Wednesday night at a Home
Depot, with his cart filled with face shields, masks and Tyvek suits, he said he was harassed by three men in their 20s, who then followed him into the parking lot.
""I heard of other Asians being assaulted over this, but when you are actually ridiculed yourself, you really feel it,"" he said the following day.
A writer for The New Yorker, Jiayang Fan, said she was taking out her trash last week when a man walking by began cursing at her for being Chinese.
""I've never felt like this in my 27 yrs in this country,"" she wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. ""I've never felt afraid to leave my home to take out the trash bc of my face.""
Attacks have also gotten physical.
In the San Fernando Valley in California, a 16-year old Asian-American boy was attacked in school by bullies who accused him of having the coronavirus. He was sent to
the emergency room to see whether he had a concussion.
In New York City a woman wearing a mask was kicked and punched in a Manhattan subway station, and a man in Queens was followed to a bus stop, shouted at and
then hit over the head in front of his 10-year-old son.
People have rushed to protect themselves. One man started a buddy-system Facebook group for Asians in New York who are afraid to take the subway by themselves.
Gun shop owners in the Washington, D.C., area said they were seeing a surge of first-time Chinese-American buyers.
At Engage Armament in Rockville, Md., most gun buyers in the first two weeks of March have been Chinese-American or Chinese, according to the owner, Andy
Raymond.
More than a fifth of Rockville's residents are of Asian ethnicity, and Mr. Raymond said buyers from Korean and Vietnamese backgrounds were not unusual. But Mr.
Raymond said he was stunned by the flow of Chinese customers -- in particular green-card holders from mainland China -- that began earlier this month, a group that
rarely patronized his shop before.
""It was just nonstop, something I've never seen,"" he said.
Mr. Raymond said that few of the Asian customers wanted to talk about why they were there, but when one of his employees asked a woman about it, she teared up. ""To
protect my daughter,"" she replied.
For recent immigrants like Mr. Du who are in close touch with friends and family in China, the virus has been a screaming danger for weeks that most Americans seemed
oblivious to.
Mr. Du is trying to remain hopeful. He spends his weekends training to become a volunteer with Maryland's emergency medical workers. He is part of a group of
Chinese-American scientists who organized a GoFundMe account to raise money for protective gear for hospital workers in the area. In three days, they raised more
than $55,000, nearly all in small donations.
But he said he was afraid of the chaos that could be unleashed if the United States death toll rises significantly.
Already a gun owner, Mr. Du, 48, said he was in the process of buying an AR-15-style rifle.
""Katrina is not far away,"" he said, alluding to the unrest in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina in 2005. ""And when all these bad things come, I am a minority.
People can see my face is Chinese, clearly. My son, when he goes out, they will know his parents are Chinese.""
For American-born Asians, there is a sudden sense of being watched that is as unsettling as it is unfamiliar.
""It's a look of disdain,"" said Chil Kong, a Korean-American theater director in Maryland. ""It's just: 'How dare you exist in my world? You are a reminder of this disease,
and you don't belong in my world.""'
He added: ""It's especially hard when you grow up here and expect this world to be yours equally. But we do not live in that world anymore. That world does not exist.""
One debate among Asian-Americans has been over whether to wear a mask in public. Wearing one risks drawing unwanted attention; but not wearing one does, too. Ms.
Zhu said her parents, who live in China, offered to ship her some.
""I'm like, 'Oh please, don't,""' she said. She said she was afraid of getting physically attacked if she wore one. ""Lots of my friends, their social media posts are all about
this: We don't wear masks. It's kind of more dangerous than the virus.""
A 30-year-old videographer in Syracuse, N.Y., said he was still shaken from a trip to the grocery store last week, when the man ahead of him in the checkout line
shouted at him, ""It's you people who brought the disease,"" and other customers just stared at him, without offering to help. That same day, he said, two couples
verbally abused him at Costco.
""I feel like I'm being invaded by this hatred,"" said the man, Edward, who asked that his last name not be used because he feared attracting more attention. ""It's
everywhere. It's silent. It's as deadly as this disease.""

202004,"
A virtual recovery meeting. A police officer donned in a face mask. A pastor without a congregation. A funeral director trying to bury the dead. This is a new America.
The merciless threat slipped into America, emptying its streets, shuttering its stores, wrecking its economy and forcing its people to retreat indoors.
In this new country, once crowded cities now feel abandoned, as if everyone suddenly moved out. There is no rush hour on the nation's highways. ""Closed"" signs hang from the
front doors of business after business.
For many, this coronavirus pandemic involves the most dramatic kind of fight -- for life, for food, for money. For others, it can feel absurdly trifling as they stay inside -- a fight
against boredom, binge eating, isolation.
There was Kalee Kamer, in Portsmouth, Ohio, 27 months sober and motivated to stay that way, participating in a recovery meeting that has moved online. Chris Allison,
patrolling the quiet city of Norman, Okla., in a sanitized police vehicle and with a blue face mask. And the Rev. Rob Lee, a pastor in Newton, N.C., without a congregation,
summoning hope amid the gloom.
This was America over 24 hours this past week, on pause and full-tilt, as the sun rose and then set and then rose again on a profoundly altered nation.
Miami
A trip to a ventanita, in Miami culture, is not just about the $1.82 cup of sweet and foamy cafecito. It is about conversation and gossip, a hangout for nosy retirees and chatty
working stiffs. Queuing is taboo. Wriggling and squeezing are the ways to reach the counter.
Or at least they were.
Flouting social distancing rules, crowds continued to congregate outside ventanitas, so much so that the county mayor threatened to shut them down. Sergio's, where the
espresso machine continues to whirl and buzz, rushed to tape markers -- six feet apart -- on the ground.
Now customers approach with caution, peering through new panes of plexiglass to order. Many scurry off with their provisions tucked in a brown paper bag.
""This is my only outing,"" said Daisy Abreu, 58, who works in magazines and left with one café con leche, one guava pastry and two empanadas.
But first she lingered for a moment to check in with Reinaldo Mesa, a 61-year-old airport contractor who picked up coffee and a medianoche sandwich. He, too, had given up
most everything in his daily routine. Except the ventanita.

Erie, Colo.
Sherry Maloney rolled out of bed, strapped on a face mask and headed for the Safeway. Today was toilet paper day. Maybe.
Rumor had it that a shipment of paper products had come in the night before. By 6:30 a.m., she was standing outside, shivering with her husband, fingers crossed she would
snag a package.
One man was down to three rolls at home. A woman said she was about ready to cut squares out of cloth diapers. ""I've been rationing two squares a trip,"" said Ms. Maloney, 63.
In the grand scheme of things, a toilet paper shortage at home is certainly not the worst crisis. But it is also certainly not normal in a land of plenty.
Inside the locked store, clerks wiped down shopping carts and spritzed the self-checkout stations. Outside, everyone talked about how a trip to the store had devolved into a
Hobbesian supermarket sweep. Jostling lines. Frantic customers. Stressed employees, exposed to God knows what germs for God knows how many hours every day.

""It's starting to get ugly,"" Ms. Maloney said. But it was friendly in line this morning. Two buddies ran into each other -- ""Don't shake his hand!"" one shouted.
The doors slid open, and Ms. Maloney strode inside.

Atlanta
Tonnia Blount shifted her big yellow school bus into gear and started off on the route she had been running for a decade, only now with no children to pick up and none to drop
off. They were all at home, stuck in little bungalows and apartments scattered across the working-class neighborhoods of southeast Atlanta.
But with nearly four in five Atlanta public school students poor enough to qualify for free or reduced lunch, most still needed their cafeteria calories. So this was Ms. Blount's
work for the foreseeable future: pulling her empty bus in front of Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School, loading it up with brown sacks full of breakfast and lunch, and then
delivering the sacks out in the maze of narrow streets, more like the driver of an ice-cream truck.
""I know my children,"" she said. ""I know who is in need.""
Every few blocks, Ms. Blount, 55, stopped the bus and honked until the parents and grandparents and aunties came out. ""How many babies?"" a co-worker in the back of the bus
would ask them, smiling, handing the bags down.
Sometimes they were not babies at all. Bryan Bush, 19, came out of an apartment in sweats and a hoodie. He had been working at Six Flags Over Georgia, the amusement
park.
Not anymore, he said. He grabbed a sack of breakfast and a sack of lunch.

Boston
Thalia Bardell crouched in front of the laptop she had propped up on a chair, centering it in the roughly three-foot-wide wedge of space between the end of her unmade bed and
a dresser.
""Hi, B!"" she called out to the screen. ""How's the dogs?""
""They're trouble,"" the screen replied.
Ms. Bardell teaches barre exercises, which are modeled loosely after ballet, to mostly women in their 20s, 30s and 40s. When Boston shut down, her clients begged her to come
up with a way to give their minds and bodies a break from idle worry about the pandemic.
Live-streamed exercise instruction was having a moment before the crisis, as home fitness companies like Peloton paired their machines with remote-access instructors. Now
teaching remotely is one of the few options instructors have left.
She called the group to attention. ""All right guys, let's go!"" Nurses, bartenders, teachers and financial analysts appeared on the screen, following her through a routine of squats
and lunges as she snapped her fingers with the precision of a metronome.
""Kerry, that's a beautiful pace!"" she said.
""Maite, lower your hips an inch.""
Ms. Bardell believes in moving quickly so no one has time to dwell on the pain. ""You're in a physically uncomfortable situation right now in your body, and you're in an
emotionally uncomfortable situation in the world,"" she said. ""And it's like, we're going to get through this together, just like we do with every single class.""

Amherst, Mass.
Ariana Lee, a Chinese student stranded on the campus of Amherst College, walked into a dining hall past a pandemic-era warning sign: ""Admittance Restricted.""
The food service workers lit up when they saw her. She greeted them brightly. ""Hi! Can I get the pulled chicken taco over Mexican rice? And some guac with the salsa, please?""
These days, with classes now online, campus feels like a ghost town. In her one-minute walk to the dining hall, Ms. Lee, a senior, encountered only one other person, a janitor
pushing a cart full of cleaning supplies across the common room, like a lone ship leaning into a storm.
The servers wore gloves, but no masks. The open cereal dispensers stood empty. The cafeteria tables were cordoned off.
The food was tastier than it was before the pandemic, she said, but the portions were smaller. She preferred not to pick up food in town, though, because ""people on the street
say racist things."" The other day, a man called her Chinese-American friend a racial expletive and said that wearing a mask would not help.
Her parents have left Beijing and are riding out a two-week quarantine in a small apartment in Hong Kong. They have to wear trackers on their wrists. Food is delivered to their
door. Her mother sprays down every package with disinfectant.
Ms. Lee walked back to her dorm room, unpacked her brown paper bag and laid out her food on her desk: two bananas, an orange, a cardboard bowl of rice, a cardboard box of
chicken tacos. She looked at it, as if it were a still-life painting, and did not eat.

Pittsburgh
The milk incident happened right after lunch, when the 8-year-old was losing patience with long division. It was his second tantrum of the day, the first set off by a missing
sweatshirt. That one had been pretty loud, but at least it didn't involve spilling milk all over the dining room table.
A home-schooling mother as of two weeks ago, Tanying Dong, 39, has been trying to make sure her oldest son does at least some schoolwork every day. When he is absorbed
in a lesson and his little brothers, ages 2 and 5, are nestled in the soft glow of PBS Kids, Ms. Dong can then maybe get to some of the endless other tasks. Such as her paying

job, in public law. And the housework. The meals. The checking-in on friends and relatives.
Three boys, at prime havoc age, with no school, no day care, no babysitter, no playgrounds, no friends and, for much of the time, no other adult.
Amid it all, she has taken up sewing. Specifically, face masks for the whole family. Ms. Dong's husband is a pediatric anesthesiologist, and while the children's hospital is not yet
a battlefield infirmary like so many urban emergency rooms, things could change quickly.
The sewing had been going pretty well until the 5-year-old knocked the sewing machine on the floor. Her husband seems to have fixed it. She'll know tonight when she picks it
back up, once the kids are in bed.

Norman, Okla.
Police Officer Chris Allison pulled over a red Chrysler 300 sedan, approached from the passenger side and asked the driver for his license and insurance. The man pulled the
papers from his glove compartment and leaned toward the window. But Officer Allison didn't touch them.
He reached instead for his cellphone.
""OK, I'm just going to take a picture of that,"" Officer Allison told the man.
Officer Allison, 34, patrols southwest Norman, where a stay-at-home order is in effect and four nursing home residents have died from the pandemic. Norman is different now,
and so is policing. The most prosaic parts of the job have become potential hazmat situations.
Officers used to sit two to a table for pre-shift briefings at headquarters, but social distancing put an end to roll call. Officers also keep their distance from one another when
they go out on calls. On Tuesday, the officer's lunch got a wipe-down: He used Clorox wipes to disinfect his milkshake, tea and wrapped straws.
At the end of his shift, he used to park his police S.U.V. outside his house, walk inside and hug his wife, 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son. Now, he pulls straight into the
garage, undresses there, stuffs his uniform into the washing machine, disinfects his equipment and then heads straight for the shower before touching anyone.
It turned out that the Chrysler's license plate didn't match the vehicle. Maybe it was stolen. Maybe the driver hadn't registered it yet. From the driver's seat of the S.U.V., the
officer asked for backup. Then he readied himself to face the driver again. He reached over to the passenger seat for his blue cloth mask.

Orlando, Fla.
Kimberley Mitchell, a second-generation funeral director, gathered the grieving family in her office. In the age of social distancing, her only goal was to help them hang on to the

Ms. Mitchell of Mitchell's Funeral Home looked into the eyes of the family representative seated across the room. A month ago, she would have placed her hand on the relative's
shoulder as a gesture of comfort.
On this afternoon, she gently laid out the dizzying, surreal set of safety rules reshaping how America buries its dead. The family settled on a simple half-hour service in the
chapel. It has 22 rows of pews -- room for seven mourners, a pastor and two staff members. They also decided to hold a memorial service once the country returned to normal.
""It feels something like 'to be continued' for some people saying goodbye to their loved ones,"" she said.
Before the crisis, Ms. Mitchell greeted family members reeling from loss with hugs. Now, it was simply too risky. Now mourners had to move through reposing rooms in shifts,
one small group at a time.
It was jarring. And exhausting. And unmooring.
But Ms. Mitchell still had her smile and her words. She could still offer hope and the promise of healing by reciting from the 30th chapter of Psalms -- ""joy cometh in the
morning.""
""The hardest thing is to see someone grieving alone,"" she said. ""Think about that. Alone.""

Pascagoula, Miss.
Dr. Steven Demetropoulos had been seeing patients since 7:10 a.m. He was tired, but he was also a man on a mission.
He needed to drive home in his pickup truck so he could quickly change clothes before heading back out, straight to City Hall, where he hoped to convince the Council to enact a
curfew.
In February, Dr. Demetropoulos became the mayor of Pascagoula, a Gulf Coast city of about 21,000 people. He ran on a platform of economic growth and beautification.
But now he also makes videos for residents about how to survive the worst public health crisis in decades. ""This is Dr. Steve, your mayor,"" he tells them, dressed in green scrubs
behind the mayor's desk.
Tomorrow he would make another video, about how droplets spread through the air and why it was important that people stay six feet apart.
His advice is not limited to physical health.
""Keep trusting, keep praying,"" he said in one video. ""We will get through this together.""

Ms. Kamer -- 27 months sober after decades of addiction to heroin, meth, crack and whatever else she could get her hands on -- lost her burger-joint waitressing job on March
15. She and her boyfriend, Chris Keeton, who is also in recovery, have cleaned the house so thoroughly it practically gleams. They watch four or five virtual recovery meetings a
week.
In this small city, the center of Ohio's opioid epidemic, temptation is never far.
The couple's gazes are fixed on the Facebook session, hosted by a local drug recovery group called Raw Addiction.
Kathy Newman, a drug treatment counselor nearly nine years in recovery, urged viewers like Ms. Kamer to stick with the program. Flurries of emojis rose across the screen as
viewers cheered in support.
Hundreds of comments appeared in real time -- testaments of hope and despair that would, in normal times, be shared face-to-face.
I'm afraid of picking up the needle again ... I need out.
I'm in rehab.
April 6th will be 18 months clean from shooting up. You guys are such a great inspiration.
Ms. Kamer, 32, wrote one: Did 2 years in prison. Haven't seen my son in 3.5 years, been clean 27 months. He is a huge motivation on why I'm still clean! #goals

The schedule promised a matchup between the Los Angeles Dodgers and the Colorado Rockies. But Dodger Stadium is empty, its doors locked shut, and outside, the birds are
louder than what is left of traffic in one of America's most congested cities.
All the familiar faces are somewhere else. The guys hawking T-shirts, the guys selling beers out of coolers, the guys scalping tickets, the women cooking bacon-wrapped hot
dogs just before the final uphill into the stadium parking lots, blocked off with signs that now say ""No public access.""
Solitary joggers passed by, one after another, under billboards advertising season tickets for a season in limbo. A man in a surgical mask walked his pug.
Alex Wood, the 29-year-old left-hander, was scheduled to pitch for the Dodgers. Right about now, the Rockies would be finishing batting practice, and Mr. Wood would be in the
clubhouse going over the game plan with his catcher and pitching coach. Instead, he's a few hundred miles away in Arizona, crashing at a teammate's house. He said he was
throwing most days, and just trying to maintain ""some semblance of sanity.""
During what would have been game time, he said, he was doing pretty much what every other American was doing. Eating. Watching television. Sleeping.
Mr. Wood counseled patience for frustrated fans. ""Let that excitement continue to build,"" he said, ""and let it loose once we start our season.""

Donna Danahy was sitting on a mattress in a hotel just off the interstate, queasy from the rising waves of dread and uncertainty.
Ms. Danahy, 58, lost her job as a server at Steak 'n Shake a couple of weeks back when it moved to drive-through only. With that, she lost the income needed to pay the first
month's rent -- $600 -- on what was supposed to be a new studio apartment.
A co-worker she had been staying with left town, leaving Ms. Danahy homeless. For several days she parked her 2006 Toyota Camry in a truck stop, drawing down curtains
attached with Velcro, sliding a sun visor in the windshield and tucking her 5-foot-1-inch frame into the back seat for a nerve-racking attempt at sleep. Sometimes she closed her
eyes and wished she would never wake up. Sometimes she was hard on herself for not securing a more stable existence.
""Leading up to this, I felt all this was self-induced; I did this to myself,"" she said.
The plan had been to move into the new place on April 1. But the landlord told Ms. Danahy she would release her unit if she could not come up with the money by April 14. She
was hired for a $13-an-hour job at a grocery store deli but could not start until she got her birth certificate, which was on its way in the mail.
A social services organization secured her the hotel room for a week. But what would she do once the week was up? She began to cry. It was hard not to feel vulnerable. She
has asthma. She wondered if she would get infected from all the moving around.

Tammy Wiatrowski curled up on a lilac sectional with a writing tray and a floral-patterned journal.
She has been writing in it since early March, after working 57 hours over four days as a charge nurse in a critical care unit. It had dealt with the first spate of the nation's
deaths, a crunch of supplies, quarantined employees and a dire uncertainty.
""As the weekend went on and more patients lost their battle with the virus, I realized both my daughters and all 5 of my grandkids could get this and might not survive.""
She told her daughters that weekend that it might be months before they could spend time together. Her home has been quiet ever since. No slumber parties. The Nerf guns sit
unused. The video game console is off. Ms. Wiatrowski has instead gone shopping, leaving groceries at her daughter's doorstep and stepping back.

""Only to be able to wave as she opened the door. Telling them 'I love them!' My grandson saying, 'It's OK, Granny, I can give you an invisible hug!' as he stretched his arms out
...""
For the first time in 14 years, her job has distanced her from the ones she loves. It is the same for her patients.
Ms. Wiatrowski cannot bring families in to hold hands during the last breaths. She cannot wrap her arms around those who are in grief. She cannot help them get a talisman,

Berkeley, Calif.
In the manner of academic scientists during normal times, at the end of a day that was light years from normal, Enrique Lin Shiao led with the data.
Never mind that the prestigious University of California, Berkeley, biology laboratory where he is a postdoctoral fellow was shuttered for regular research studies. Or that Dr. Lin
Shiao, 31, was presenting his results to disembodied colleagues in a Slack channel as he ate dinner.
What mattered was that providing the data to the Food and Drug Administration was a prerequisite for clearance to perform much-needed clinical tests for the new coronavirus.
And the data was good.
""Awesome work,"" typed Jennifer Doudna, a Berkeley professor who runs the Innovative Genomics Institute, as she studied Dr. Lin Shiao's graphs from her living room.
The dearth of tests available to Americans who may be infected has anguished molecular biologists, whose research routinely invokes the basic procedure used to detect virus
genes in a patient's nasal swab.
Dr. Doudna, the co-developer of a gene-editing tool called CRISPR, has transformed the first floor of her institute into a testing center that aims to process at least 1,000
samples a day. But first, the group needed to show the F.D.A. the lowest level of virus its test could detect.
As some of Dr. Lin Shiao's colleagues appended congratulatory ""clapping"" and ""on fire"" icons to the charts that indicated the test was highly sensitive, others looked ahead, to
when they would begin again.

The sky over Central Park was slate gray, with pinpoints of stars dim amid the city's stubborn glow.
The East Meadow, its lush grass preserved by fences and ""Keep Off"" signs for an anticipated summer of sun tanning and picnics, was instead bathed in a sea of white medical
tents brought by truck from North Carolina to aid the city's overwhelmed hospitals.
The tents -- 14 in all -- were empty, save for 68 portable metal beds, neatly laid with identical white sheets and pillows.
Samaritan's Purse, a Christian charity, drove in its own supplies. Once the field hospital gets final administrative approval from health department officials to operate, the city
will supply the patients.
In the I.C.U. tent, there were 10 beds, each accompanied by the most desired piece of medical equipment in the world -- a ventilator, which can cost upward of $50,000.
Samaritan's Purse has used the same field hospital to treat families stricken by Ebola in Liberia, to care for townspeople who had been trapped in rubble after an earthquake in
Ecuador, and to operate on children in Iraq who had been struck by shrapnel launched by the Islamic State.
A few weeks ago, it set up a similar field hospital in Cremona, Italy, the nation with the world's most coronavirus fatalities. This is the first time one of the hospitals has been
deployed in the United States. No one knows how long a field hospital will be needed in the center of Manhattan.

The sky was still dark when the Rev. Rob Lee sat down at his desk, picked up his fountain pen and began to write.
Even in normal times, Mr. Lee, 27, is an early riser. But in the weeks since a pandemic put an end to all routines, including Sunday church, he has been waking up earlier and
earlier, no need for an alarm.
He thinks about his congregation of about 50 regulars and the ""collective pain"" shared across the world right now. He thinks about his wife, who lost hours at her marketing job.
He thinks about his mother, a hospice nurse. And, if he is being honest, he thinks about himself, his own mortality. A year and a half ago, a lung collapsed during an asthma
attack, leaving him especially vulnerable to the outbreak.
A few weeks ago, as the crisis intensified, he issued an online callout for prayer requests and offered to send handwritten letters in return. So far, he has received more than
300:
I am alone in California and far from family.
I just lost my job today.
I feel lonely and unsettled in these times.
Mr. Lee, a descendant of General Robert E. Lee who once made headlines for speaking out against white supremacy and Confederate monuments, sees the current crisis as
another pivotal moment for the country.
Writing back to the supplicants has become both a grounding ritual to calm his own anxieties -- and a small act of resistance.

"
202004,"
When confronted with racism toward anyone, our instinct should be indignation, not deflection.
Mid-February, when the world was starting to go pear-shaped, I had to travel to an area where I’d previously experienced anti-Asian sentiment. So a few days before the trip, I
emailed my (white) hairdresser frantically: “I know this sounds crazy but can you can make me blonde? I’m traveling next week and I’m worried about being mistaken for
Chinese and blamed for the coronavirus.”
Let’s skip the ridiculousness of the idea for a second to focus on the important bit: Why had I worded my request so offensively? I could have just said I was worried about
xenophobia. Why was I throwing people of Chinese descent under the bus? It’s like that old joke about the two people running away from a bear: You don’t have to outrun the
bear, you just have to outrun the other guy. Except in this case: You don’t have to deal with racism; you just have to make people racist at someone else.
My panic was a humbling reminder that I should never be overly confident that I would do the right thing in the face of fear. Sure, wanting to avoid racial profiling is a survival
instinct. But survival instincts are often amoral and, if unchecked, can easily turn ugly.
I ended up not dyeing my hair because a sudden allergy attack made it ill advised. Also, it was stupid.
But I shared my anxiety with a half-Chinese-American, half-white friend. What if I get stopped at the airport for extra screening? I asked. She messaged, “Carry around a copy
of your books to prove you’re Korean.” (Two of the books I wrote have the word “Korean” in the title.) She added: “I’m serious.”
I messaged “LOL,” dismissed her idea for about 10 minutes … and then put copies of my books in my carry-on bag.
What was my plan? To run up to someone hurling epithets and say, “Hey I think we can all agree this Covid stuff is all China’s fault, but good news, I’m Korean! You know, the
ones who brought you BTS? So we’re good, right?”
This impulse isn’t exactly new, even if the pandemic has brought out its most sinister form. I’ve been doing it since I was a child. Worse, I was taught to do it.
When I was a kid in late-1970s suburban Chicago, anti-Chinese taunts were a daily occurrence. It was a frequent topic at Korean church — the only place we clapped eyes on
other Koreans outside our own homes. Our parents and Sunday school teachers told us that the correct response was, “I’m not Chinese; I’m Korean.” (This didn’t even work, it
should be noted: When I informed a mean kindergartner that I was Korean, he responded, “There is no such place.”)
None of us kids were proud of being Korean-American back then. The grown-ups tried to counter this shame by instilling ethnic pride. But despite their good intentions, they
invited pride’s ugly sibling: implied permission to step on other people.
For an inarticulate child, maybe “I’m not Chinese” isn’t an especially meaningful retort. But a grown woman should know better.
So what finally brought about my moment of self-reckoning? It was a T-shirt.
Last month, a Chinese-American friend of mine posted on social media about a targeted internet ad that had outraged her. In the wake of Covid-19, some clothing vendor saw a
business opportunity: a series of T-shirts with slogans like, “I’m Asian but I’m not Chinese,” “I’m not Chinese, I’m Korean,” “I’m not Chinese, I’m Malaysian,” etc. Her friends’
comments under her post were equally indignant. (So much for predictive algorithms, by the way.)
My first thought was, “I wish we’d had these shirts when I was a kid.”
And then I stopped myself, horrified.
By way of context — not justification — Asians have been siccing people on other Asians for ages. In World War II-era America, some Asian-owned businesses posted signs in
their windows specifying that they were not Japanese. I have even met a few Asians of that generation who currently believe that it made political sense for Franklin D.
Roosevelt to put Japanese-Americans in internment camps. Just the Japanese.
Which is not to say that mislabeling isn’t dangerous; it can even be deadly. In Highland Park, Mich., in 1982, there was an incident that all Asian-Americans of a certain age
remember vividly: A Chinese-American named Vincent Chin was murdered in a strip club by two white autoworkers who assumed he was Japanese — one of the people who,
they believed, had destroyed the American auto industry.
It was a tragic case of mistaken identity. But to respond to that horrific incident with “Vincent Chin wasn’t even Japanese!” is to create a dangerous distraction from the core
issue: It is never OK to attack anyone based on their race.

202004,"
With coronavirus concerns, stay-at-home orders, financial instability and mounting civil unrest, it is no surprise
that mothers are experiencing intensified anger.
After I wrote a personal essay on mom rage in 2019, strangers on Twitter declared me an unfit mother. But I
expected Twitter-hate. What I did not expect were the many emails I received from mothers around the world,
saying they too struggle with mom rage and my story made them feel less alone.
After the initial flood of emails, a trickle continued over the next six months. Then Covid-19 happened, and with
it, stay-at-home orders. My inbox began lighting up again, illuminating a direct correlation between mom rage
and sheltering in place.
""Mom rage"" is the colloquial term for the unrestrained anger many women experience during pregnancy,
postpartum and beyond.

It is a popular topic these days in a support group for working moms at The Motherhood Center, a clinical
treatment facility in Manhattan that offers services for pregnant and postpartum women. Paige Bellenbaum, a
group facilitator and the center's founding director, said, ""Mom rage is something we talk about all the time.
Social isolation, lack of support, managing high levels of anxiety and stress -- this is the new normal of being a
mother, and during the pandemic in particular.""
Anger and rage are waving red flags hinting at feelings below the surface. Mothers who experience rage may be
feeling alone, unheard, and unsupported, Bellenbaum said. ""But it's so much more powerful to feel angry and
rageful than to touch the vulnerability of what lives behind it.""
Between stay-at-home orders, Covid-19 health concerns, financial instability (or fear of it), and police violence
against Black people, it is no surprise that mothers are experiencing intensified rage above the surface, and
feelings of grief, fear, and loneliness below.
""We're asking all parents, but it's especially moms on the front lines, to try to do 24/7 child care without a break
at the same time that they're trying to often hold down a job,"" said Laura Markham, Ph.D., a clinical
psychologist, parenting coach and author of ""Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids: How to Stop Yelling and Start
Connecting."" ""So, is there more mom rage?"" she asked. ""How could there not be?""
Mom rage expresses itself in different ways. Anya Persaud, who has a 3-year-old and a newborn and lives in
Beacon, N.Y., could pinpoint her fury: ""Raising my voice and walking hard are signs I'm heading from frustration
to rage.""
Virginia Duan, who homeschools her four children, ages 3, 6, 8 and 10, in the San Francisco Bay Area, said: ""It
feels as if I am going to physically explode, like having an out-of-body experience where I cannot seem to
control the litany of invectives flying from my mouth.""
Molly Caro May, who lives in Bozeman, Mont., and is the author of ""Body Full of Stars: Female Rage and My
Passage into Motherhood,"" said of her rage, ""I never hurt anyone, but I was out in the forest throwing rocks at
trees.""
Moms aren't supposed to yell and stomp and throw rocks, and we aren't supposed to share our rage publicly. I
have wondered if I've been able to write openly about mom rage without much reproach because it has become
so commonplace in our lexicon, or if it is because I am white.
Nefertiti Austin, the author of ""Motherhood So White: A Memoir of Race, Gender, and Parenting in America,""
wasn't familiar with the term ""mom rage"" but acknowledged that the intense anger is somewhat universal for
moms. Of Black mothers, Austin said: ""It's tricky for us, because we are already saddled with 'angry Black
woman.' I definitely don't want to be described as having mom rage, because it's not going to play the same if I
say I have it, than if a white mom says she has it.""
Austin added that because of racist stereotypes, Black mothers are under more pressure to appear perfect. With
police violence against Black people, Austin said, Black mothers may have their ""children on a tighter leash than
white parents.""
""The whole 'kids will be kids' thing? We know that that's not true when it comes to our kids. There isn't a lot of
grace for Black children,"" Austin said.
That fear and perfectionism can only add fuel to the mom-rage fire.
Since viewing the video of George Floyd's death, Persuad said her mood and sleep have suffered. ""I've had
overwhelming anxiety and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.""
Duan said one of the factors affecting her mom rage is ""the trauma of being Asian-American during the

pandemic,"" after some, including President Trump, have blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak. The
attack has led to a surge in xenophobia against Asian-Americans.
It's been a few months since the pandemic began and several weeks since protests against police violence
filled our neighborhoods. All the while, mothers continue to work multiple jobs at once (teacher and mom at a
minimum), and they're exhausted. May said she vacillates between ""this week, we're going to study cities of
the United States"" and ""actually, we're just going to be outside playing with sticks.""
Like May, Duan concedes her bandwidth has been lower since Covid-19. ""I think it goes hand-in-hand with my
resignation,"" she said. ""I'm fine with the kids just messing around and occasionally learning.""
Persaud is having similar throw-up-her-hands moments these days. ""Where before I might have raised my
voice, now I give in,"" she said. She will allow her son to skip a nap or eat with the television on. ""Surely, we
can't yell and scream every day, right?""
This ""laissez faire"" parenting style seems more than warranted during this strange, stuck-at-home period. But
how can mothers fill up their tanks above empty? Is self-care even possible for mothers during the
coronavirus era?
May described her self-care during the pandemic as ""feast or famine."" ""Some weeks, I'm on it,"" she said. ""I
exercise, feed myself beautiful food, get some quiet time, and I feel really good. Other weeks I'm literally
eating butter on bread in the corner of my kitchen eight times a day. It can feel like I just need to get my
basic needs met and everyone is in the way of that.""
When I asked Persaud how she makes time for herself, she answered unequivocally, ""Showers!"" Whitney
Sandoval, who lives in Wichita, Kan., with her 5- and 3-year-olds, will drive to pick up her groceries and then
hang out in her car in the parking lot. ""I listen to music or a podcast, read or just sit in silence. It's the
closest I can get to being alone.""
Eating properly, exercising, showering and getting a little alone time sound like they belong in the ""basic
health requirements"" category as opposed to ""self-care for mothers.""
Even if those bare minimum self-care needs are met, mom rage doesn't just disappear. Rage has something
to say and, according to Dr. Markham, ""Rage doesn't dissipate until it feels heard.""
Ruth King, an educator, life coach, meditation teacher and the author of many books, including ""Healing
Rage: Women Making Inner Peace Possible"" and ""Mindful of Race: Transforming Racism from the Inside Out,""
said: ""Rage sits at the crossroads of personal transformation. Rage is not to be understood as a useless
emotion, empty of knowledge. Rather, rage is fierce clarity and untapped fuel -- when we push rage away, we
can't learn from it.""
Unfortunately, many mothers are doing just that. It is a challenge to find mothers who will talk on the record
for this article. One mom eagerly emailed me about her rage, but then declined being quoted, saying, ""You
know, mom shame.""
Bellenbaum of The Motherhood Center said, ""There's so much guilt that we feel toward ourselves, and a kind
of inner-disappointment that we have these types of feelings at this intensity, especially toward our children.""
It can be challenging for partners living with those who have mom rage to be able to offer compassion and
support, especially during the pandemic, when the emotional bandwidth of all parents is stretched thin.
In support groups at The Motherhood Center, Bellenbaum has seen mothers find the nonjudgmental
witnesses they need in each other. She said, ""When we connect with other women who are having the same
feelings, that sense of community creates an initial and immediate relief.""

202004,"
With more than 2,000 incidents and little action from the federal government, efforts to curtail pandemic-related
racism have fallen to P.S.A.s and social media campaigns.
A new public service announcement makes a point that federal leaders have largely overlooked: Asian-
Americans are facing a surge of harassment linked to fears about the coronavirus pandemic.
The spot, which debuted on Tuesday, includes testimonials from a firefighter, a nurse, a driver, an artist, the
celebrity chef Melissa King and others, who describe being told to ""go back to China"" or having people spit in
their direction.
The somber ad, produced by the nonprofit Advertising Council with help from the Emmy-winning writer Alan
Yang, ends with a request: ""Fight the virus. Fight the bias.""
Anxiety about the novel respiratory virus, which was first detected in Wuhan, China, has fueled xenophobia and
bigotry toward people of Asian descent. A coalition of civil rights groups recorded more than 2,100 incidents in

15 weeks; the New York City Commission on Human Rights recently described a ""sharp increase in instances of
hostility and harassment."" A list of recent cases compiled by the Anti-Defamation League chronicles ""surging
reports of xenophobic and racist incidents,"" including Asian-owned stores defaced with racist graffiti, video chats
disrupted by anti-Asian comments and people being beaten or denied entry to businesses.
President Trump has repeatedly described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" and, in recent weeks, as ""kung
flu,"" despite saying publicly that it is ""very important that we totally protect our Asian-American community in
the United States"" and that the pandemic is ""not their fault in any way."" Inflammatory statements from leaders
can exacerbate racist behavior, according to researchers and civil rights leaders.
The fight against pandemic-related harassment of Asian-Americans has largely fallen to civil rights groups,
marketing agencies, social media accounts and nonprofit organizations, which have promoted hashtags like
#IAmNotCovid19, #RacismIsAVirus, #HealthNotHate and #MakeNoiseToday.
Asiancy, an affinity group of the Wieden + Kennedy Portland ad agency, posted a video in May about the
repercussions of recent anti-Asian discrimination. The marketing firm IW Group recruited actors, musicians,
designers and influencers to participate in the #WashTheHate campaign.
The Ad Council, which also introduced a face mask initiative with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York this
month, will roll out the new anti-harassment campaign online and on television.
The issue of racism toward Asians hit ""very close to home,"" said Mr. Yang, who is known for popular shows like
""Parks and Recreation"" and ""Master of None."" He had just finished directing and publicizing ""Tigertail,"" a family
drama made for Netflix featuring a nearly all-Asian and Asian-American cast.
One of the lead ""Tigertail"" actors, Tzi Ma, was at a Whole Foods store in Pasadena, Calif., early in the outbreak
when a man approached in a car and told Mr. Ma that he ""should be quarantined,"" Mr. Yang said. Later, during
an interview with Mr. Yang on Instagram Live, viewers left comments saying he and the interviewer, an Asian
man, were the same person.
""This wasn't an abstract idea to me, something theoretical,"" Mr. Yang said. ""I knew people this was happening
to."" He described the production process as ""an emotionally fraught time,"" when he toggled between overseeing
the shoot over Zoom and attending Black Lives Matter protests.
The result, Mr. Yang said, is a rare example of a nationwide marketing effort focused on Asian issues,
represented by Asian-Americans from a wide range of backgrounds.
""It's very meaningful to me,"" he said. ""I never saw this growing up.""
In a Pew Research Center survey, 58 percent of English-speaking Asian-American adults said expressions of
racist or insensitive views about Asians had become more common since the pandemic began. More than 30
percent said they had encountered slurs or racist jokes in recent months, and 26 percent said they feared being
threatened or physically attacked because of their race -- a higher percentage than for Black, white and Hispanic
adults.
But many Americans, including several non-Asian members of the production team working on the Ad Council's
campaign, have been unaware of pandemic-related racism, Mr. Yang said.
Steven Moy, the chief executive of the Barbarian ad agency, said campaigns like this one were ""a good starting
point.""
""I don't know if this is enough, or how effective it will be, but let's do baby steps and create awareness,"" he
said. ""I have not seen enough of this -- we should do more.""

program that has partnered artists with city agencies since 2015. She is one of two artists currently embedded
with the city's Commission on Human Rights, which invested $220,000 in this campaign.
Ms. Phingbodhipakkiya's ""I Still Believe in Our City"" series was created as a response to a grim statistic. From
February to September, the Commission received more than 566 reports of discrimination, harassment and bias
related to Covid-19 -- 184 of which were anti-Asian in nature. It's a troubling spike not just appearing in New
York, but in Asian-American communities across the country.

The attacks have renewed fears over a wave of anti-Asian violence and harassment that was spurred earlier in
the pandemic.
The videos are graphic and shocking.
In January, a local television station showed footage of a young man sprinting toward, then violently shoving to
the ground, a man identified as Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84, who had been out for a morning walk in the Anza Vista
neighborhood of San Francisco. He later died.
Another video shows a 91-year-old man in Oakland's Chinatown neighborhood being pushed facedown into the
sidewalk cement from behind in an apparently unprovoked attack.
The attacks quickly reinvigorated simmering outrage, fear and hurt over a wave of anti-Asian violence and
harassment that community leaders say was spurred earlier in the pandemic by the rhetoric of former President
Donald J. Trump, who insisted on calling the coronavirus ""the China virus"" or the ""Kung Flu.""

Carl Chan, the president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce, has tallied more than 20 assaults
over the past two weeks in Oakland's Chinatown alone. Many of them were not reported, Mr. Chan said, partly
because it can take hours for the police to arrive at the scene.
""Our seniors are afraid to walk their own streets,"" Mr. Chan said.
Articles and Instagram slide shows using a now-familiar palette of pastels and bold lettering have since
proliferated, sounding alarms about rising anti-Asian violence with jarring statistics and calls to confront racism
against Asians with the urgency that has animated wide support for the Black Lives Matter movement.
The violence comes as the Chinese community on Friday marks the Lunar New Year, a muted celebration after a
crushing year for the banquet halls, restaurants and businesses that would normally be pulsing with holiday
cheer.
The pandemic has hit San Francisco's Chinatown, America's oldest and largest, particularly hard. The lack of
tourists; the spate of violent attacks and robberies; and pandemic-related racism against Asian-Americans have
combined to exacerbate the economic pain felt in Chinatown.
A measure of the tense and subdued Chinese New Year celebrations this year was a scene from a park in San
Francisco's Chinatown on Thursday afternoon. Will Lex Ham, a New York-based actor, was helping lead a
neighborhood safety patrol, handing out whistles to residents as well as a Chinese-language pamphlet titled,
""How to Report a Hate Crime.""
In recent weeks, the outrage over the attacks has grown broader.
[Sign up for California Today , our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]
In early February, not long after leaders in Oakland's Chinatown, along with Mayor Libby Schaaf, held a news
conference pleading for help after a series of recent attacks targeting Asian-American seniors, the actor Daniel
Dae Kim retweeted the video of the attack on the 91-year-old man, saying that such crimes ""have been ignored
and even excused."" He and the actor Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.
California's Asian Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus issued a statement condemning ""a surge in hate crimes
targeting innocent Asian and Pacific Islander Americans,"" describing it as ""a national emergency.""
But while researchers have said that inflammatory statements from leaders can exacerbate racist behavior,
experts say it is difficult to quantify hate.
Incidents of racism can take many forms -- like being coughed on or spat upon, or being denied a rideshare.
Tallying such incidents requires that victims tell the authorities or another organization what happened, which
can be difficult when they may feel ashamed or distrustful of those authorities.
One statistic that has been widely cited, identifying a 1,900 percent increase in hate crimes against Asian-
Americans, appears to come from the New York Police Department, which said that in 2019, only one anti-Asian
incident was reported, compared with 20 in the first half of 2020, according to The Queens Chronicle.
Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative formed last March aimed at tracking and responding to incidents of violence and
discrimination against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than 2,800 reports of racism and
discrimination targeting Asian-Americans between March 19 and Dec. 31.
Of those, a vast majority, about 71 percent, were incidents of verbal harassment. Physical assaults made up 8.7
percent.

the leaders of Stop AAPI Hate, said that, according to the organization's data, people 60 and older were
disproportionately targeted with physical violence, as were women.
Dr. Jeung said that it was not clear whether the recent attacks in the Bay Area were racially motivated, but
that it was likely that older people walking alone through their neighborhoods to shop may appear vulnerable.
And particularly around holidays, they may be carrying cash.
""We tend to see small upticks in crime during the Lunar New Year because people are out shopping,"" Dr.
Jeung said.
In another widely reported incident this month, a 64-year-old woman of Vietnamese descent had just left a
bank with more than $1,000 in cash for the holiday when her purse was snatched.
What is clear, Dr. Jeung said, is that Asian-American communities are in pain. And even with new recognition
from President Biden -- who last month signed a memorandum directing federal agencies to explore ways of
combating racism and xenophobia against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders in the United States -- there
is more work to be done.
""The community is alarmed and upset and we demand justice,"" Dr. Jeung said.
San Francisco is not the only area of the country seeing a rise in hate crimes against Asian-Americans. New
York City saw a large surge in hate crimes directed at Asians in 2020 and most of the increase was directly
related to the pandemic, the police said.
There were at least 28 hate crimes against Asians reported to the New York police, and all but four involved
an assumption that the victim had the coronavirus, the police said. The crimes included assault, vandalism,
theft and harassment.
In August, the steep rise in bias crimes against Asian people prompted the New York Police Department to
form a special task force to investigate them. ""It was a huge uptick, so much so that people were starting to
talk about it, and we needed to address the situation,"" said Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, the task force's
director.
But in 2021, some community organizers and advocacy groups, including Stop AAPI Hate, have said Asian-
Americans must look beyond calling for increased police presence in neighborhoods to achieve that justice.
""We recognize that policing has led to the criminalization of communities of color, and mass incarceration,"" Dr.
Jeung said. ""Why perpetuate a system that doesn't work?""
The people arrested in both the Chinatown incident in Oakland and the fatal assault on Mr. Ratanapakdee are
Black, which community organizers said has brought to the fore some anti-Black racism, particularly as
outrage about the attacks has spread on social media.
Lai Wa Wu, policy and alliance director for the San Francisco-based Chinese Progressive Association, said that
while the influence of the former president was a new factor, the tensions among communities of color were
not new, and neither were the systemic inequities that perpetuate them.
There are no shortcuts to deep, sustainable healing, Ms. Wu said. Progress requires investing in
neighborhoods; increasing access to education, housing and food; and having ""difficult, honest
conversations.""
Nevertheless, she said, ""It's been really heartening in some sense, to see the level of solidarity and the
amount of support, not only from our own communities in the city and across the Bay, but from Black and
brown communities.""

Younger activists have harnessed social media to raise awareness and circulate calls to action, including
fund-raising drives and volunteer initiatives.
Eda Yu, 25, a writer and journalist who is half Chinese and half Indonesian, and her partner, Myles
Thompson, a Black designer, saw news of the attacks and recognized the strong emotions they raised. The
couple, she said, ""wanted to come together and create a project that was rooted in solidarity.""
They made an Instagram slide show they hoped would serve as a piece of protest art and a resource for
those who want to help.
The first image, Ms. Yu said, was meant to look like a poster.
""Please! Protect our elders,"" it reads. ""Support our Chinatowns. Support our communities.""
The rest includes a timeline of incidents and a list of community organizations working in Asian
communities in the Bay Area. They listed each organization's website and created a GoFundMe to donate
to all the organizations at once; they would split up the money and one of their employers said they would
match contributions. The initial goal was to raise $5,000. In two days, they raised $50,000.
""It was crazy,"" Ms. Yu said.
The couple is working with the director of API Equality -- Northern California to distribute the funds fairly
and transparently.
Esther Kim, 22, said that when she first heard that some $10,000 worth of cash, tablets and computers
had been stolen from her family's small Korean restaurant, the Crew, in San Francisco's Sunset district, it
felt as if it could have been the last in a long line of devastating blows.
On top of the financial loss to the restaurant, which her family treated like a second home, irreplaceable
documents -- Ms. Kim's diploma, her mother's handwritten journals, immigration paperwork, receipts --
were also gone.
Her mother, a cancer survivor, had continued to cook and serve takeout though she was at risk of getting
sick from the virus. Ms. Kim said her parents were not native English speakers, so navigating the
applications for pandemic relief and other government programs was challenging.
The break-in came amid what she said had been a spate of similar burglaries or robberies in the
neighborhood. ""In the Sunset, there's a lot of Chinese grandparents that run family restaurants that take
cash only,"" she said.
Ms. Kim said that her friends persuaded her to start a GoFundMe for the restaurant, and that her family
had been amazed by and thankful for the outpouring of support.
While she is troubled by the apparent rise in crimes against Asian-Americans, she said her family saw the
burglary as an extension of wider suffering in the pandemic.
""We don't see the burglary as a form of Asian-American violence -- no one got hurt, everything was
replaceable,"" Ms. Kim said. ""But we're in the crossfire.""

202004,"
A frightening wave of attacks has Asian communities on edge. But I experienced street harassment long before
the pandemic.
One of the first English words I learned was an ethnic slur I heard whenever my parents and I walked around
the city. I was 7 years old and had just moved to Brooklyn from China. One day, eager to show off, I turned to
my father and declared, ""We are chinks now!"" in English. My father looked as if I had stabbed him. In a grave,
low voice he told me to never utter that word again.
That slur has haunted me throughout my life, cutting like a knife when I least expect it. A boy on a bike once
screamed it so deep into my ear that it rang for hours afterward. The ringing eventually subsided, but the street
harassment became a regular fixture in my life.
Before the pandemic, the simple act of walking to the courthouse where I work demanded exhaustive control of
my body. For a while I tried very hard to make myself look less feminine and more white. I'd pretend to be deaf
when strangers addressed me with their eyes pulled back into a slant while taunting ""Me love you long time"" or
loudly said they had ""yellow fever.""
As the coronavirus spread, I began to dread my commute to work. People made a show of keeping away from

me even in crowded subway train cars. Other times, the harassment was more overt -- strangers bumped their
shoulders into me; someone jabbed me with the pointy metal end of a long umbrella while shouting, ""Go back
to China."" My parents wore hats, sunglasses and double masks whenever they left the house.
The last time I took the train to work, in March, a man put his face inches away from mine and shouted ""chink""
while looking me dead in the eyes. Not one person came to my defense. The slur rang through my ears,
transporting me back to my childhood. I haven't set foot on a train or a bus since.
I'm far from alone. The United States has had a surge in violence against Asian-Americans during the pandemic.
Between March and December 2020, Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative that tracks and responds to reported
incidents of violence and discrimination directed at Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders, received more than
2,800 reports of incidents against Asian-Americans. Stop AAPI Hate also found that women are twice as likely as
men to report coronavirus-related harassment.
Though Anti-Asian sentiment has increased during the pandemic, it is woven into the very fabric of this country.
The Page Act of 1875 effectively barred Chinese women, who were believed to spread sexual disease and to
pose a threat to white values, lives and futures, from entering the country. The Chinese Exclusion Act, which
was signed into law in 1882, was the first and only enacted legislation to prohibit immigration of all individuals
of a particular national origin. The exclusion laws weren't repealed until 1943, when Congress established an
immigration quota for China of about 105 visas per year.
The country's legal framework dehumanized Asian immigrants, and in turn emboldened Americans to brutalize
us. In the Chinese Massacre of 1871, a white mob hanged nearly 20 Chinese immigrants in makeshift gallows in
Los Angeles. In 1930, hundreds of white men roamed the streets of Watsonville, Calif., terrorizing Filipino
farmworkers for days before killing a man. After Pearl Harbor, an angry nation used Japanese-Americans as a
scapegoat. After the Vietnam War, the Ku Klux Klan tried to drive Vietnamese-Americans out of Texas by burning
their houses and boats -- a symptom of anti-Vietnamese sentiment across the country.
The recent spate of attacks is targeting the most vulnerable members of our community. Two assailants slapped
an 89-year-old woman in the face and set her shirt on fire in Brooklyn last fall. In January, an 84-year-old man
died after he was brutally attacked while on a morning walk in San Francisco. This week a 52-year-old woman
waiting in line outside a bakery in Flushing, Queens, was rushed to the hospital after she was violently shoved
and blacked out.
Many seem intent on ignoring our pain, marking us with the broad stroke of the condescending model-minority
brush. They normalize racism against Asian-Americans, and allowed our former president to incite hatred using
racist language like ""Kung flu"" and ""China plague.""
At work, my boss accused me of being ""oversensitive,"" of making things about race that aren't. I have been told
that Asian-Americans don't experience racism. I half-believed it, thinking that I was taking things too personally,
being too weak -- too ""Asian."" When I said that my former law firm needed to do more than pay lip service to
the Black Lives Matter movement, the same boss, a white man who used the term ""open kimono"" in business
meetings, dismissed the idea and declared that I, as an Asian-American, had it so much better than ""them.""
As long as white supremacy is permitted to perpetuate a divide between Asian-Americans and Black and
Indigenous people and other people of color, we can make no real progress against our common oppressor: the
systems in our country that were designed to shut us all out.
In 1992, my father left his job as a professor in China in pursuit of the rights and equality touted by our nation's
founders. Nearly three decades later, he hesitates each time he leaves his home. And yet, when I asked him
about it over Lunar New Year, he showed no signs of resignation, choosing to believe instead that things will get
better. As he often said to me growing up, no matter what came our way: America can be good.

202004,"
Too often, attention to nonwhite groups is only as pressing as the injuries that they have suffered.
A 23-year-old Korean woman in New York was punched in the face last March and accused of having the
coronavirus. More incidents followed as the virus spread, with Asian-Americans being spat on, beaten, slashed,
even attacked with chemicals.
In response to pandemic-related violence like this, advocacy organizations came together to document cases of
harassment and vitriol against Asian-Americans. Stop AAPI Hate received 2,800 reports in 2020, around 240 of
which were physical assaults, and the AAPI Emergency Response Network has received over 3,000 reports since
it started tracking Covid-specific hate incidents last year.
The violence has continued into the new year. In January, in San Francisco, an 84-year-old Thai man died after
being assaulted on the street; across the Bay, in Oakland’s Chinatown, a 91-year-old man was shoved to the
ground. Some of these cases have made it to national news, but most haven’t. The low profile of this wave of
violence is a reminder of how racial violence goes unexamined when it doesn’t fit neatly into the standard
narrative of race in America.
Racial violence in the United States is not simply Black and white, even if it looks that way. Instead, it can reveal
layered victimizations and mediated enmity. The recent incidents of anti-Asian violence in the Bay Area, in
particular, highlight this: Some Asian-Americans were outraged by the violence and demanded justice, but since
the perpetrators in these cases were Black, many others felt deeply uncomfortable with contributing to the
criminalization of African-Americans.

And here we come to the heart of the complexity of “speaking up” for Asian-Americans. Thanks to the “Model
Minority” myth — popularized in 1966 by the sociologist William Petersen and later used as a direct counterpoint
to the “welfare queen” stereotype applied to Black Americans — Asian-Americans have long been used by
mainstream white culture to shame and drive a wedge against other minority groups.
They are always caught in a no-win position between whites and Black Americans. They are thought to be
“white adjacent,” but of course they can never belong to the club. They are persistently racialized, yet they often
don’t count in the American racial equation. The central, though often unspoken, question underlying all of this
is: Are Asian-Americans injured, or injured enough, to deserve our national attention?
To ask this question is to reveal something about how this country thinks about a racial calculus based on
damage and hierarchy. Asian-Americans exist in a weird but convenient lacuna in American politics and culture.
If they register at all on the national consciousness, it is either as a foreign threat (the Yellow Peril, the Asian
Tiger, the Spy, the Disease Vector) or as the domestic but ultimately disposable prism for deflecting or excusing
racism against other minorities.
This recent onslaught of anti-Asian violence can partly be attributed to our former president, who spoke nonstop
of the “Chinese virus” and even the “kung flu,” but he could not have rallied the kind of hatred that he did
without this country’s long history of systemic and cultural racism against people of Asian descent.
For our histories are more entangled than how we tell them. Few people know that many of the same families
that amassed wealth through slavery also profited from the opium trade in China; that at least 17 Chinese
residents were the targeted victims of one of the worst mass lynchings in American history in Los Angeles’s
“Negro Alley” in 1871; that America’s immigration policy and ideas of citizenship were built on top of laws like
the 1882 Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred Chinese laborers from immigrating to the U.S. for 10 years; or
that the “Model Minority” myth veils how Bhutanese- and Burmese-Americans experience poverty rates over 30
percent.
I think of James Baldwin’s words: “This is the crime of which I accuse my country and my countrymen, and for
which neither I nor time nor history will ever forgive them, that they have destroyed and are destroying
hundreds of thousands of lives and do not know it and do not want to know it.”
When it comes to Asian-American grief, do Americans want to know?
These past few weeks, it seems as if Americans have opened to a kind of knowing. As I saw these recent
incidents of anti-Asian violence unfold in the news, I felt a profound sense of grief. But I also experienced
something akin to relief. Maybe, I thought, now people will start to respond to anti-Asian violence with the same
urgency they apply to other kinds of racism.
But then I started to feel a familiar queasiness in the pit of my stomach. Is this indeed what it takes? A political
imagination (or, really, lack thereof) that predicates recognition on the price of visible harm?
There is something wrong with the way Americans think about who deserves social justice — as though
attention to nonwhite groups, their histories and conditions, is only as pressing as the injuries that they have
suffered. Racial justice is often couched in arcane, moralistic terms rather than understood as an ethical given in
democratic participation.
It seems crazily naïve to suggest that we ought to learn, value and want to know about all of our countrymen
out of respect rather than guilt. Yet while legitimizing racial and cultural differences exclusively in terms of injury
may motivate reform in the short run, in the long term it feeds a politics of tribalism that erupts over and over
again.
Two decades ago, I wrote in my book “The Melancholy of Race” that “we are a nation at ease with grievance but

202004,"
The fatal assault in San Francisco on a defenseless older man was the latest terrifying episode for Asian-
Americans, many of whom have endured racist taunts, rants and worse during the pandemic.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Weary of being cooped inside during the pandemic, Vicha Ratanapakdee was impatient for
his regular morning walk. He washed his face, put on a baseball cap and face mask and told his wife he would
have the coffee she had prepared for him when he returned. Then, on a brisk and misty Northern California
winter morning last month, he stepped outside.
About an hour later, Mr. Vicha, an 84-year-old retired auditor from Thailand, was violently slammed to the
ground by a man who charged into him at full speed. It was the type of forceful body blow that might have
knocked unconscious a young football player in full protective pads. For Mr. Vicha, who stood 5 feet 6 inches and
weighed 113 pounds, the attack was fatal. He died of a brain hemorrhage in a San Francisco hospital two days
later.
Captured on a neighbor's security camera, the video of the attack was watched with horror around the world.

Among Asian-Americans, many of whom have endured racist taunts, rants and worse during the coronavirus
pandemic, the killing of a defenseless older man became a rallying cry.
In the past year, researchers and activist groups have tallied thousands of racist incidents against Asian-
Americans, a surge in hate that they link to former President Donald J. Trump repeatedly referring to the
coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus."" Mr. Vicha's family described his killing as racially motivated, and it spurred a
campaign to raise awareness by many prominent Asian-Americans, who used the online hashtags
#JusticeForVicha and #StopAsianHate.
""The killing of Vicha was so plain as day,"" said Will Lex Ham, a New York-based actor, who after watching the
video flew from New York to San Francisco to help lead protests and safety patrols in Asian neighborhoods.
""There was no longer any way to ignore the violence that was happening to people who look like us.""
Antoine Watson, a 19-year-old resident of neighboring Daly City, was arrested two days after the attack and
charged with murder and elder abuse. He has pleaded not guilty but his lawyer admits that his client had an
""outburst of rage.""
Chesa Boudin, the San Francisco district attorney, says Mr. Vicha's death was heinous. But he says there is no
evidence to suggest it was motivated by racial animus.
Still, at a time when demands for racial justice have rocked a demographically evolving nation, the killing of Mr.
Vicha was notable for the galvanizing anger it brought to a diverse group that encompasses people of Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, South Asian and Southeast Asian heritage. The killing of a Thai man in America has given
voice to a united community under the umbrella of an Asian-American identity.
In the weeks since it happened, Mr. Vicha's death has become a symbol for the vulnerability that many in the
Asian-American community feel in this moment.
For his family, the death has been devastating both in California and abroad. In Thailand, the killing was front-
page news and described as barbaric, a life cut short in a family where siblings typically live into their late 90s,
relatives say.
Since his retirement in 1996 from Kasikornbank, one of Thailand's largest financial institutions, Mr. Vicha had
traveled between San Francisco, where his eldest daughter lives, and Thailand, where his youngest does.
For months Mr. Vicha had been pining to return to Thailand but was unable to because of the pandemic. He
disliked the chilly and wet San Francisco winter and missed his favorite southern Thai dishes and his extended
family and friends.
His brother, Surachai Ratanapakdee, 89, now the only surviving sibling of eight children, remembered Mr. Vicha
as studious and curious about the world outside the rice paddies, watermelon fields and orchards of the family
farm.
""Vicha was one of only a few people in the village who spoke English well,"" Mr. Surachai said.
Mr. Vicha went on to study at Thammasat University in Bangkok, one of the country's most prestigious
institutions.
His older daughter, Monthanus, described her father as a devoted Buddhist. She remains puzzled why on the
morning of the attack he left without his Buddhist amulet, a talisman of protection that he always wore around
his neck.
When Ms. Monthanus expressed her desire to go to graduate school two decades ago, Mr. Vicha supported her
decision to enroll in business school at the University of California, Berkeley. After her graduation, when Ms.
Firefox

Monthanus married and decided to stay in San Francisco, Mr. Vicha and his wife came to help raise their
grandchildren.
At the time of the attack, Mr. Vicha was only months away from being able to return to Thailand. On Jan. 15,
he received the first shot of the Moderna vaccine.
""We said, 'Dad, we are going to go back soon!""' Ms. Monthanus recalled.
Mr. Vicha's second shot was scheduled for Feb. 12, an appointment he would not live to make.
His killing came at a time when other disturbing images and reports were emerging from across the San
Francisco Bay. Three days later an attacker shoved a 91-year-old man in Oakland's Chinatown to the ground,
another video that rocketed around the internet.
That older victim has been wrongly described in many news accounts as Asian. Court documents give the
victim's name as Gilbert Diaz, and Carl Chan, a community leader and president of the Oakland Chinatown
Chamber of Commerce, said the victim was Latino. But Mr. Chan says he has tallied more than two dozen
assaults against Asian-American victims in Chinatown, including two other people shoved by the assailant
who knocked down Mr. Diaz.
Crime data from the district attorney offices in San Francisco County and Alameda County, which includes
Oakland, show that people of Asian descent were less likely last year to be victims of crimes than other ethnic
groups. In San Francisco, where 36 percent of the population is of Asian descent, 16 percent of crime victims
of known ethnicity were Asian, a similar situation to Alameda County.
But leaders of the Bay Area Asian community say crime statistics are misleading because Asian-American
residents, especially immigrants, often do not report assaults or robberies out of mistrust of the system or
language barriers. What is incontrovertible, say leaders of the Asian-American community nationwide, is that
the pandemic created a climate of fear and a feeling of insecurity from New York to California. In the past
week the California Legislature approved $1.4 million in funding to track and research racist incidents against
Asian-Americans.
""Our seniors are afraid to walk their own streets,"" Mr. Chan said.
Last year Ms. Monthanus, Mr. Vicha's daughter, was twice accosted on the street by people who told her to
leave the country because, the attackers said, Asians had caused the coronavirus.
Mr. Watson's lawyer, Sliman Nawabi, a public defender, said his client would not have been able to identify Mr.
Vicha's ethnicity through his face mask, cap and winter clothing. Mr. Nawabi described Mr. Watson as
someone who had struggled with anger.
In the hours before the attack, Mr. Watson had a string of setbacks. He left his home because of a family
dispute and got in a traffic accident in San Francisco at 2 a.m. He was cited by the San Francisco police for
running a stop sign and reckless driving and then slept that night in his car.
On that morning a number of security cameras in the area captured Mr. Watson banging a car with his hand,
according to Mr. Boudin, the district attorney.
""It appears that the defendant was in some sort of a temper tantrum,"" Mr. Boudin said.
It was then that Mr. Vicha walked up Anzavista Avenue, a street with views of skyscrapers in the city's
financial district.
A witness told police officers that Mr. Watson said something to the effect of ""What are you looking at?"" A

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that an outbreak of the viral disease COVID-19 - first identified in December 2019 in
Wuhan, China - had reached the level of a global pandemic. Citing concerns with the alarming levels of spread and severity, the WHO called for
governments to take urgent and aggressive action to stop the spread of the virus.
International human rights law guarantees everyone the right to the highest attainable standard of health and obligates governments to take steps to
prevent threats to public health and to provide medical care to those who need it. Human rights law also recognizes that in the context of serious public
health threats and public emergencies threatening the life of the nation, restrictions on some rights can be justified when they have a legal basis, are
strictly necessary, based on scientific evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human dignity,
subject to review, and proportionate to achieve the objective.
The scale and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic clearly rises to the level of a public health threat that could justify restrictions on certain rights, such
as those that result from the imposition of quarantine or isolation limiting freedom of movement. At the same time, careful attention to human rights
such as non-discrimination and human rights principles such as transparency and respect for human dignity can foster an effective response amidst the
turmoil and disruption that inevitably results in times of crisis and limit the harms that can come from the imposition of overly broad measures that do
not meet the above criteria.
This document provides an overview of human rights concerns posed by the coronavirus outbreak, drawing on examples of government responses to
date, and recommends ways governments and other actors can respect human rights in their response.

COVID-19
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus first identified in December 2019. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses known to cause
respiratory infections. There is no vaccine yet to prevent COVID-19, and no specific treatment for it, other than managing the symptoms.
By mid-March 2020, more than 150 countries had reported cases of COVID-19, and the WHO reported there were more than 200,000 cases worldwide.
More than 7,000 people had died and the numbers were continuing to rise at an alarming rate.
Applicable International Standards
Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which most countries have adopted, everyone has the right to the highest
attainable standard of physical and mental health. Governments are obligated to take effective steps for the prevention, treatment and control of
epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases.
The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors state compliance with the covenant, has stated that:
The right to health is closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights, as contained in the International Bill of Rights,
including the rights to food, housing, work, education, human dignity, life, non-discrimination, equality, the prohibition against torture, privacy, access to
information, and the freedoms of association, assembly and movement. These and other rights and freedoms address integral components of the right to
health.
The right to health provides that health facilities, goods, and services should be:
available in sufficient quantity,
accessible to everyone without discrimination, and affordable for all, even marginalized groups;
acceptable, meaning respectful of medical ethics and culturally appropriate; and
scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality. The Siracusa Principles, adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in 1984, and UN
Human Rights Committee general comments on states of emergency and freedom of movement provide authoritative guidance on government
responses that restrict human rights for reasons of public health or national emergency. Any measures taken to protect the population that limit people's
rights and freedoms must be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. States of emergency need to be limited in duration and any curtailment of rights
needs to take into consideration the disproportionate impact on specific populations or marginalized groups.
On March 16, 2020, a group of UN human rights experts said that emergency declarations based on the COVID-19 outbreak should not be used as a
basis to target particular groups, minorities, or individuals. It should not function as a cover for repressive action under the guise of protecting health...
and should not be used simply to quash dissent.
The Siracusa Principles specically state that restrictions should, at a minimum, be:
provided for and carried out in accordance with the law;
directed toward a legitimate objective of general interest;
strictly necessary in a democratic society to achieve the objective;
the least intrusive and restrictive available to reach the objective;
based on scientic evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application; and
of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, and subject to review. Human Rights Concerns
Protect freedom of expression and ensure access to critical information
Under international human rights law, governments have an obligation to protect the right to freedom of expression, including the right to seek, receive,
and impart information of all kinds, regardless of frontiers. Permissible restrictions on freedom of expression for reasons of public health, noted above,
may not put in jeopardy the right itself.

Governments are responsible for providing information necessary for the protection and promotion of rights, including the right to health. The Committee
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards as a core obligation providing education and access to information concerning the main health problems
in the community, including methods of preventing and controlling them. A rights-respecting response to COVID-19 needs to ensure that accurate and
up-to-date information about the virus, access to services, service disruptions, and other aspects of the response to the outbreak is readily available and
accessible to all.
In a number of countries, governments have failed to uphold the right to freedom of expression, taking actions against journalists and healthcare
workers. This ultimately limited effective communication about the onset of the disease and undermined trust in government actions:
China's government initially withheld basic information about the coronavirus from the public, underreported cases of infection, downplayed the severity
of the infection, and dismissed the likelihood of transmission between humans. Authorities detained people for reporting on the epidemic on social media
and internet users for rumor-mongering, censored online discussions of the epidemic, and curbed media reporting. In early January, Li Wenliang, a
doctor at a hospital in Wuhan where infected patients were being treated, was summoned by police for spreading rumors after he warned of the new
virus in an online chatroom. He died in early February from the virus.
In Iran, the outbreak emerged after authorities had severely damaged public trust by brutally repressing widespread anti-government protests and lying
about shooting down a civilian airliner. As a result, Iranian authorities have struggled to assure the public that government decision-making around the
COVID-19 outbreak has been in the public's best interests. The unusually high rate of reported cases of government officials contracting the virus, as
well as the inconsistency in figures announced by officials and domestic media sources, have heightened concerns that the data is either being
deliberately underreported or poorly collected and analyzed.
In Thailand, whistleblowers in the public health sector and online journalists have faced retaliatory lawsuits and intimidation from authorities after they
criticized government responses to the outbreak, raised concerns about a possible cover-up, and reported alleged corruption related to the hoarding and
profiteering of surgical masks and other supplies. Some medical personnel were also threatened with disciplinary action - including termination of
employment contracts and revocation of their licenses - for speaking out about the severe shortage of essential supplies in hospitals across the country.
A few countries prioritized open communication and transparent reporting on the number of cases:
Taiwan took swift steps to combat the virus, including promptly making credible information widely available to the public. Daily press briefings by health
officials and public service announcements aim to counter misinformation and have helped to calm panic, restore public confidence, and encourage
people's assistance in the crisis.
Singapore's government published and regularly updated detailed statistics on the number and rate of infections and recoveries.
South Korea's government also published health data and health officials gave two daily briefings to establish public confidence and promote citizen
vigilance.
In Italy, inconsistent messages from public officials, including for domestic political reasons, may initially have diluted the impact of public service
announcements about proper hygiene and social distancing. The government has held daily news conferences to share data and implemented an
aggressive public campaign about better practices to protect oneself and others from spreading the virus.
Recommendations:
Governments should fully respect the rights to freedom of expression and access to information, and only restrict them as international standards
permit.
Governments should ensure that the information they provide to the public regarding COVID-19 is accurate, timely, and consistent with human rights
principles. This is important for addressing false and misleading information.
All information about COVID-19 should be accessible and available in multiple languages, including for those with low or no literacy. This should include
qualified sign language interpretation for televised announcements, as Taiwan has done; websites that are accessible to people with vision, hearing,
learning, and other disabilities; and telephone-based services that have text capabilities for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Communications
should utilize plain language to maximize understanding. Age appropriate information should be provided to children to help them take steps to protect
themselves.
Health data is particularly sensitive, and the publication of information online can pose a significant risk to affected persons and in particular people who
are already in positions of vulnerability or marginalization in society. Rights-based legal safeguards should govern the appropriate use and handling of
personal health data.
Reliable and unfettered access to the internet should be maintained and steps should be taken to ensure internet access be available to people with low
incomes. The US Federal Communications Commission's Keep Americans Connected pledge commits participating companies not to terminate service to
customers who are unable to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, to waive any late fees, and to open Wi-Fi
hotspots to any American who needs them. Further steps could be taken to lift data caps, upgrade speeds, and eliminate eligibility requirements for any
low-income targeted plans during the pandemic.
Ensure quarantines, lockdowns, and travel bans comply with rights norms
International human rights law, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), requires that restrictions on rights for reasons of
public health or national emergency be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. Restrictions such as mandatory quarantine or isolation of symptomatic
people must, at a minimum, be carried out in accordance with the law. They must be strictly necessary to achieve a legitimate objective, based on
scientific evidence, proportionate to achieve that objective, neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human
dignity, and subject to review.

Broad quarantines and lockdowns of indeterminate length rarely meet these criteria and are often imposed precipitously, without ensuring the protection
of those under quarantine - especially at-risk populations. Because such quarantines and lockdowns are difficult to impose and enforce uniformly, they
are often arbitrary or discriminatory in application.
Freedom of movement under international human rights law protects, in principle, the right of everyone to leave any country, to enter their own country
of nationality, and the right of everyone lawfully in a country to move freely in the whole territory of the country. Restrictions on these rights can only be
imposed when lawful, for a legitimate purpose, and when the restrictions are proportionate, including in considering their impact. Travel bans and
restrictions on freedom of movement may not be discriminatory nor have the effect of denying people the right to seek asylum or of violating the
absolute ban on being returned to where they face persecution or torture.
Governments have broad authority under international law to ban visitors and migrants from other countries. However, domestic and international travel
bans historically have often had limited effectiveness in preventing transmission, and may in fact accelerate disease spread if people flee from quarantine
zones prior to their imposition.
In China, the government imposed an overly broad quarantine with little respect for rights:
In mid-January, authorities in China quarantined close to 60 million people in two days in an effort to limit transmission from the city of Wuhan in Hubei
province, where the virus was first reported, even though by the time the quarantine started, 5 million of Wuhan's 11 million residents had left the city.
Many residents in cities under quarantine expressed difficulties obtaining medical care and other life necessities, and chilling stories have emerged of
deaths and illnesses: A boy with cerebral palsy died because no one took care of him after his father was taken to be quarantined. A woman with
leukemia died after being turned away by several hospitals because of concerns about cross-infection. A mother desperately pleaded to the police to let
her daughter with leukemia through a checkpoint at a bridge to get chemotherapy. A man with kidney disease jumped to his death from his apartment
balcony after he couldn't get access to health facilities for dialysis. Authorities have also reportedly used various intrusive containment measures:
barricading shut the doors of suspected infected families with metal poles, arresting people for refusing to wear masks, and flying drones with
loudspeakers to scold people who went outside without masks. The authorities did little to combat discrimination against people from Wuhan or Hubei
province who traveled elsewhere in China.
In Italy the government has imposed a lockdown but with greater protections for individual rights. The Italian government adopted progressively
restrictive measures since the first major outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country in late February. Authorities initially placed ten towns in Lombardy
and one in Veneto under strict quarantine, prohibiting residents from leaving the areas. At the same time, they closed schools in affected regions. Citing
a surge in cases and an increasingly unsustainable burden on the public healthcare system, the government on March 8 imposed a slew of new
measures on much of the country's north that put in place much more severe restrictions on movement and basic freedoms. The next day, the measures
were applied across the country. Further measures imposed included restrictions on travel except for essential work or health reasons (upon self-
certification), closure of all cultural centers (cinemas, museums), and cancellation of sports events and public gatherings. On March 11 the government
closed all bars, restaurants, and stores except food markets and pharmacies (and a few other exceptions) across the country. People who disobey the
travel restrictions without a valid reason can be fined up to 206 euros and face a three-month prison term. All schools and universities were closed
throughout the country. People have been allowed out to shop for essential items, exercise, work (if unable to perform work from home), and for health
reasons (including care for a sick relative).
Other governments, such as those in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore have responded to the outbreak without enacting sweeping
restrictions on personal liberty, but have reduced the number of travelers from other countries with significant outbreaks. In South Korea, the
government adopted proactive and ramped-up testing for COVID-19. It focused on identifying infection hotspots, conducting a large number of tests on
at-risk people without charge, disinfecting streets in areas with high numbers of infections, setting up drive-through testing centers, and promoting
social distancing. In Hong Kong, there have been concerted efforts to promote social distancing, handwashing, and mask-wearing. Taiwan proactively
identified patients who sought health care for symptoms of respiratory illness and had some tested for COVID-19. It also set up a system that alerts the
authorities based on travel history and symptoms during clinical visits to aid in case identification and monitoring. Singapore adopted a contact-tracing
program for those confirmed to have the virus, among other measures. However, the government's decision to deport four foreign workers for violating a
mandatory 14-day leave of absence from work and ban them from working in the country raises concern of disproportionate penalties.
Recommendations:
Governments should avoid sweeping and overly broad restrictions on movement and personal liberty, and only move towards mandatory restrictions
when scientifically warranted and necessary and when mechanisms for support of those affected can be ensured. A letter from more than 800 public
health and legal experts in the US stated, Voluntary self-isolation measures [combined with education, widespread screening, and universal access to
treatment] are more likely to induce cooperation and protect public trust than coercive measures and are more likely to prevent attempts to avoid
contact with the healthcare system.
When quarantines or lockdowns are imposed, governments are obligated to ensure access to food, water, health care, and care-giving support. Many
older people and people with disabilities rely on uninterrupted home and community services and support. Ensuring continuity of these services and
operations means that public agencies, community organizations, health care providers, and other essential service providers are able to continue
performing essential functions to meet the needs of older people and people with disabilities. Government strategies should minimize disruption in
services and develop contingent sources of comparable services. Disruption of community-based services can result in the institutionalization of persons
with disabilities and older people, which can lead to negative health outcomes, including death, as discussed below.
Protect people in custody and in institutions
COVID-19, like other infectious diseases, poses a higher risk to populations that live in close proximity to each other. And it disproportionately affects
older people and individuals with underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. Eighty
percent of the people who have died of COVID-19 in China were over the age of 60.

This risk is particularly acute in places of detention, such as prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers, as well as residential institutions for people
with disabilities and nursing facilities for older people, where the virus can spread rapidly, especially if access to health care is already poor. States have
an obligation to ensure medical care for those in their custody at least equivalent to that available to the general population, and must not deny or limit
detainees, including asylum seekers or undocumented migrants, equal access to preventive, curative or palliative health care. Asylum seekers, refugees
living in camps, and people experiencing homelessness may also be at increased risk because of their lack of access to adequate water and hygiene
facilities.
In nursing facilities and other settings with large numbers of older people, visitor policies should balance the protection of older and at-risk residents
with their need for family and connection. The US Department of Veterans Affairs announced a no visitors policy at its 134 nursing homes around the
country in response to the risk of COVID-19. While the risk to older people is serious, blanket policies do not take into account public health guidance or
the needs of older people.
People in prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers frequently do not receive adequate health care under normal circumstances, even in
economically developed countries. Severely substandard health care has contributed to recent deaths of immigrants in the custody of US Immigration
and Customs Enforcement. Populations in custody often include older people and people with serious chronic health conditions, meaning they are at
greater risk for illness from COVID-19.
Many people in US jails have not been convicted of a crime but are locked up simply because they cannot afford to pay the bail set in their case. Older
men and women are the fastest growing group in US prisons due to lengthy sentences, and prison officials already have difficulty providing them
appropriate medical care. As a response, in one county in the US state of Ohio, the courts expedited review of people in jail, releasing some and
transferring others to prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit that seeks to challenge ongoing immigrant detention in the context
of the virus.
Prisoners in Iran have reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus, including in Evin prison in Tehran and in the cities of Euromieh and Rasht. In an
open letter in February, families of 25 prisoners detained for peaceful activism sought their at least temporary release amid the outbreak and lack of
sufficient prison medical care. In March, the Iranian judiciary ¼Դ¾ÅҴ! ¡ÒÃÍéҧÍԧ¡ÒÃàª×èÍÁâ§ËÅÒÂÁԵÔäÁè¶١µéͧ  about 85,000 prisoners for the Persian
New Year (Nowruz), a substantially greater number than normal for the holiday, apparently because of health concerns surrounding the coronavirus
outbreak. However, dozens of human rights defenders and others held on vaguely defined national security crimes remained in prison.
On March 12, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa reportedly pardoned 901 detainees for humanitarian reasons, in the backdrop of the current
circumstances, likely in reference to the coronavirus outbreak. The Ministry of Interior announced that another 585 detainees would be released and
granted non-custodial sentences.
In Italy, prisoners in over 40 prisons have protested over fears of contagion in overcrowded facilities and against bans on family visits and supervised
release during the coronavirus pandemic. In response, authorities have authorized for the first time the use of email and Skype for contact between
prisoners and their families and for educational purposes and announced a plan to release and place under house arrest prisoners with less than 18
months on their sentence. The main prisoner rights organization in Italy, Antigone, estimated this could benefit at most 3,000 prisoners, while the
penitentiary system is at around 14,000 over capacity. The organization called for broader measures to ensure the release of a greater number of
detainees, including in particular older detainees and those with at-risk health profiles, among other measures. Civil society organizations have also
called for alternatives to detention for all people currently detained in immigration detention centers in Italy due to the increased risk of infection and no
prospect for deportation.
Recommendations:
Government agencies with authority over people housed in prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers should consider reducing their populations
through appropriate supervised or early release of low-risk category of detainees including for example, those whose scheduled release may be soon,
those who are in pre-trial detention for non-violent and lesser offenses, or whose continued detention is similarly unnecessary or not justified. Detained
individuals at high risk of suffering serious effects from the virus, such as older people and people with underlying health conditions, should also be
considered for similar release with regard to whether the detention facility has the capacity to protect their health, including guaranteed access to
treatment, and taking into consideration factors such as the gravity of the crime committed and time served.
If safe and legal deportations are suspended due to the virus, the legal justification for detaining people pending deportation may no longer exist. In
these cases, authorities should release detainees and institute alternatives to detention.
Authorities that operate prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers should publicly disclose their plans of action to reduce the risk of coronavirus
infection in their facilities and the steps they will take to contain the infection and protect prisoners, prison staff, and visitors, if cases of the virus or
exposure to it are present. Persons in any form of detention have the same right to health as the non-incarcerated population and are entitled to the
same standards of prevention and treatment. The detained population and the general population have a compelling interest to know in advance what
plans authorities have put in place for handling COVID-19.
Authorities should take steps to ensure they are appropriately coordinating with public health departments and communicating openly with staff and
people in custody. They should also screen and test for COVID-19 according to the most recent recommendations of health authorities. They should
provide appropriate hygiene training and supplies and ensure that all areas susceptible to harboring the virus and accessible to prisoners, prison staff,
and visitors, are disinfected regularly, consistent with accepted best practices. They should develop plans for housing people exposed to or infected with
the virus. They should ensure that individuals released or put on supervised leave have access to appropriate accommodations and health care. Any
plans for lockdowns or isolation should be limited in scope and duration based on the best science available, and they should not be or seem punitive, as
fear of being placed in lockdowns or isolation could delay people notifying medical staff if they experience symptoms of infection. Detention centers
should consider alternative strategies such as video conferencing for individuals to be able to connect with family or legal counsel.
Governments seeking to contain the spread of the virus should evaluate and modify as necessary during the time of the outbreak measures used to
enforce immigration laws, including court hearings and check-ins with authorities as alternatives to detention. Authorities should provide public notice
6/24/2021
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
6/11
that there will be no negative repercussions for missed court dates or check-ins during the time of the outbreak. Authorities should stop arbitrary
detentions of migrants, seek alternatives to detention for people currently in immigration detention, and opt for release where possible, particularly for
those in high-risk categories if infected and for people who are being held with no prospect for imminent, safe, and legal deportation.
In the absence of adequate state support, the United Nations and other inter-governmental agencies should urgently press for access to formal and
informal detention facilities to provide detainees with life-saving assistance.
Governments housing refugees and asylum seekers should ensure their response to COVID-19 includes prevention and treatment measures, with
particular attention to measures to alleviate overcrowding in detention centers and camps, improve sanitation and access to health care, and resort to
time-bound quarantines and isolation only as necessary.
Ensure protection of health workers
As part of the right to health, the ICESCR provides that governments should create conditions that would assure to all medical service and medical
attention in the event of sickness.
Governments have an obligation to minimize the risk of occupational accidents and diseases including by ensuring workers have health information and
adequate protective clothing and equipment. This means providing health workers and others involved in the COVID-19 response with appropriate
training in infection control and with appropriate protective gear.
Combating the spread of COVID-19 requires that health facilities have adequate water, sanitation, hygiene, healthcare waste management, and cleaning.
A 2019 baseline report by WHO and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) found that [a]n estimated 896 million people use health care facilities with no
water service and 1.5 billion use facilities with no sanitation service.
Human Rights Watch research into hospital-acquired infections in Hungary suggests the nation's mismanaged, underfunded, and understaffed public
healthcare system is poorly equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak. Patients and medical experts described a lack of basic hygiene protocol, lack of
isolation rooms, and a shortage of health professionals, doctors and nurses, and medical supplies in general. One doctor said it was nearly impossible to
get essential items like disinfectant and respirator masks, which are critical to protect against viruses.
In Venezuela, Human Rights Watch has documented a health system in utter collapse. Hospitals have closed or are operating at a fraction of their
capacity, many without regular access to electricity or water. Vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and diphtheria have returned long before the
pandemic hit.
Broad sanctions imposed by the US on Iran have drastically constrained the ability of the country to finance humanitarian imports, including medicines.
This has caused serious hardships for ordinary Iranians. Concerned governments should support Iran's efforts to combat the COVID-19, including by
providing access to medical devices and testing kits.
In Thailand, public health capacity has been diminished by corruption. Medical personnel lack surgical masks and local supplies have been diverted and
shipped to China and other markets in part due to corruption.
The Health Ministry in Egypt in February sent doctors and medical teams to a quarantine facility without informing them that their transfer was part of
the COVID-19 response or of the risks entailed. Medical staff said they were tricked into the assignment.
In Lebanon, the spokesperson for the country's medical supply importers told Human Rights Watch that the country had run out of gloves, masks,
gowns, and other supplies necessary to deal with the coronavirus outbreak due to the financial crisis that had prevented them from importing needed
goods. She added that medical supply importers have brought in just US$10 million of the $120 million in goods they have sought since October and
nearly all transactions have been frozen since February due to the country's ongoing economic crisis. The head of the Syndicate of Private Hospitals said
that the government owes private hospitals more than $1.3 billion, compromising their ability to pay staff and purchase medical equipment. Yet the
Lebanese government has not put in place any measures to address the economic crisis threatening access to medical care, medicine, and medical
equipment.
Recommendations:
Governments should take measures so that health care is available to all, accessible without discrimination, affordable, respectful of medical ethics,
culturally appropriate, and of good quality.
Governments should ensure that health workers have access to appropriate protective equipment and that social protection programs are in place for the
families of workers who die or become ill as a result of their work, and ensure such programs include informal workers, who represent a large share of
the caregiving sector.
In past epidemics, fear of exposure has led to attacks on health workers. Governments should monitor for such attacks to deter them, and ensure that
they can quickly, adequately, and appropriately respond if attacks occur.
Fulfill the right to education-even if schools are temporarily closed
Many countries have closed schools since the COVID-19 outbreak, disrupting the learning and education of hundreds of millions of students. In times of
crises, schools provide children with a sense of stability and normalcy and ensure children have a routine and are emotionally supported to cope with a
changing situation. Schools also provide important spaces for children and their families to learn about hygiene, appropriate handwashing techniques,
and coping with situations that will break routines. Without access to schools, this prime responsibility falls on parents, guardians, and caregivers. When
schools are closed, government agencies should step in to provide clear and accurate public health information through appropriate media.

To ensure education systems respond adequately, UNESCO has recommended that states adopt a variety of hi-tech, low-tech and no tech solutions to
assure the continuity of learning. In many countries, teachers already use online learning platforms to complement normal contact hours in classrooms
for homework, classroom exercises, and research, and many students have access to technological equipment at home. However, not all countries,
communities, families, or social groups have adequate internet access, and many children live in places with frequent government-led internet
shutdowns.
Recommendations:
Online learning should be used to mitigate the immediate impact of lost normal school time. Schools deploying educational technology for online learning
should ensure the tools protect child rights and privacy. Governments should attempt to recover missed in-person class time once schools reopen.
Governments should adopt measures to mitigate the disproportionate effects on children who already experience barriers to education, or who are
marginalized for various reasons - including girls, those with disabilities, those affected by their location, their family situation, and other inequalities.
Governments should focus on adopting strategies that support all students through closures - for example, monitoring students most at risk and
ensuring students receive printed or online materials on time, with particular attention provided to students with disabilities who may require adapted,
accessible material.
Governments should adopt mitigation strategies, for example by working with teachers, school officials, and teachers' unions and associations to factor
in plans to recover teaching or contact hours lost, adjusting school calendars and exam schedules, and ensuring fair compensation for teachers and
school personnel who are working additional hours.
In countries with high numbers of out-of-school children, school closures may jeopardize efforts to increase school enrollments and retention, particularly
at the secondary level. Governments should place additional measures to monitor compliance with compulsory education - and ensure government
education officials monitor school returns once schools reopen. Education officials should focus attention on areas with high incidence of child labor or
child marriage and ensure all children return to school. Officials should also ensure that schools with refugee students adopt outreach measures to
ensure refugee children return to school, including by working with refugee parent groups and community leaders.
Sudden school closures may also leave low-income families struggling to make ends meet and provide necessities. Governments should guarantee
continued meal provision during school closures for children in low-income families who will miss subsidized meals.
Address disproportionate impacts on women and girls
Outbreaks of disease often have gendered impacts. Human Rights Watch found that the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak and the 2015-2016 outbreak
of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil had particularly harmful impacts on women and girls and reinforced longstanding gender inequity. News
reports and public health analysis suggest that COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting women in a number of ways.
Though risks specific to pregnant women exposed to COVID-19 are not yet clear, the outbreak could negatively affect sexual and reproductive health and
rights. Overloaded health systems, reallocation of resources, shortages of medical supplies, and disruptions of global supply chains could harm women's
access to contraception and pre- and post-natal and birth care. Although the risk of infection through breastfeeding is not known, the UN Population
Fund has recommended that breastfeeding mothers who become ill should not be separated from their infants. Past epidemics, such as the Ebola
outbreak in Sierra Leone, have impacted the availability of routine prenatal and maternity care, leaving women more at risk to preventable maternal
deaths or morbidities.
In China, press reports suggest an increase in domestic violence under quarantine. Crises - and lockdowns - can trigger greater incidence of domestic
violence for reasons including increased stress, cramped and difficult living conditions, and breakdowns in community support mechanisms. Crises can
often further limit women's ability to get away from abuse, and place victims in an environment without appropriate access to services, such as safe
shelter away from abusers and accountability for abuse.
Women globally do almost 2.5 times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men, and they are more likely than men to face additional care giving
responsibilities when schools close, making it harder to maintain paid employment. Japan responded to the potential for a disproportionate impact on
families with young children by offering to offset costs to businesses for workers taking paid leave to care for children during school closures, though the
amount offered was low. Italy was considering measures to mitigate the effects of the lockdown on families with children. These could include
emergency paid parental leave or vouchers for families with children up to 12 years old (or children with disabilities without any age limit) who need to
pay for childcare amid the prolonged school closures.
Up to 95 percent of female workers in some regions work in the informal sector where there is no job security, and no safety net if a crisis like COVID-19
destroys their earnings. Informal work includes many occupations most likely to be harmed by a quarantine, social distancing, and economic slowdown,
such as street vendors, goods traders, and seasonal workers. Women are also over-represented in service industries that have been among the hardest
hit by the response to COVID-19.
Worldwide, 70 percent of health and social service providers are women - meaning women are at the front lines of containing the spread of COVID-19
and may be heavily exposed to the virus through work in the health sector. Fear in communities about the exposure that health workers face may lead
women in this sector to be shunned or face stigma, adding an extra burden to the challenge of trying to protect their and their families' health. This may
manifest itself, for example, in trying to access or secure childcare while they work on the front lines.
Some female care workers are migrant domestic workers. They can be vulnerable to abusive employment conditions in normal times, and are at
heightened risk of abuse, losing employment, being frontline caregivers without adequate protections, and of being trapped and unable to reach their
homes during a crisis. They may also face barriers to protecting their own health.
Moves toward telecommuting - for school and work - as a means of social distancing can disproportionately harm women and girls. Women are up to 31
percent less likely to have internet access than men in some countries, and worldwide about 327 million fewer women than men have a smartphone.

Even when women have access to the internet, gender disparities may make them less able to use it for reasons including cost, socialization, and family
pressures. When multiple members of a household need access to limited computing resources within the home, gender inequality may mean women
and girls have less access.
Recommendations:
Authorities should take steps to mitigate gendered impacts and ensure that responses do not perpetuate gender inequity.
When education is moved online, governments and education providers should monitor participation and retention of students in online courses for a
gendered impact and respond quickly with strategies to retain and reengage women and girls if their participation falls off. They should also address the
particular risks of job losses to women who may take on additional caregiving during school closures.
Measures designed to assist workers affected by the pandemic should ensure the assistance of workers in informal work and service industries, who are
predominantly women.
Governments should ensure public awareness campaigns address how victims of domestic violence can access services, and should ensure that services
are available to all victims of domestic violence, including those living in areas under movement restrictions or under quarantine and those infected with
COVID-19.
Governments should support frontline health and social service care workers with the recognition that these workers are mostly women. Support should
include consideration of their needs as caregivers within their own families and the impact of stigma on them and their families.
Both source and destination countries for migrant domestic workers should adopt special measures to locate and assist migrant domestic workers to
prevent abusive labor conditions and provide assistance relating to managing COVID-19.
Governments and international bodies should closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and act to mitigate the impact of the
pandemic on the right of women and girls to access sexual and reproductive health services.
Root out discrimination and stigma, protect patient confidentiality
During previous public health crises, people with infection or disease and their families have often faced discrimination and stigma. For example, Human
Rights Watch found that people living with HIV in Kenya, South Africa, the Philippines, and the US faced discrimination and stigma due to their HIV
status and have been prevented from accessing health care, getting jobs, and attending school. Public health research has shown that survivors of Ebola
in West Africa have faced harmful stigma that, in some cases, has led to eviction, loss of employment, abandonment, violence, and other consequences.
Since the coronavirus outbreak, news reports from a number of countries have documented bias, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination against people
of Asian descent. Incidents include physical attacks and beatings, violent bullying in schools, angry threats, discrimination at school or in workplaces,
and the use of derogatory language in news reports and on social media platforms, among others. Since January, media have reported alarming
incidents of hate crimes in the United Kingdom, the US, Spain, and Italy, among other countries, targeting people of Asian descent, apparently linked to
COVID-19. Senior US government officials, including President Donald Trump, have stoked anti-Chinese sentiment by referring to the coronavirus as the
Chinese Virus, and in one incident reported by a White House correspondent, the Kung Flu. Anti-immigrant leaders like Victor Orban in Hungary and
Matteo Salvini in Italy have seized on the pandemic to stoke xenophobic sentiment.
South Korean authorities believe 63 percent of the then more than 7,300 confirmed cases in the country attended services held by the Shincheonji
Church of Jesus in the city of Daegu or had contact with attendees. In a statement, the church reported 4,000 cases of injustice against congregants
since the outbreak, including termination of employment, workplace bullying, domestic persecution, labeling, and slandering, and said the church was
being blamed as the main culprit of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Reporting by the BBC in South Korea found that public health alerts around the virus may not have adequately protected the privacy of individuals with
the virus.
Governments should take swift action to protect from attack individuals and communities who may be targeted as bearing responsibility for COVID-19,
thoroughly investigate all reported incidents, and hold perpetrators accountable.
Governments should ensure that response measures to COVID-19 do not target or discriminate against particular religious or ethnic groups, and that
responses are inclusive of and respect the rights of marginalized groups, including people with disabilities and older people. Governments should ensure
equal access to emergency services to people with disabilities and older people.
Governments should work to combat stigma and discrimination by training health workers on COVID-19, using mass media and school networks to
expand public awareness of human rights, and recognizing that the virus knows no boundaries and recognizes no distinctions of race, ethnicity, religion,
or nationality.
Governments should ensure that patient confidentiality is protected even as authorities take steps to identify those who may have been exposed to the
virus.
Ensure marginalized populations can access health care without discrimination
The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, a pediatrician by training, has said that [t]o effectively combat the outbreak means
ensuring everyone has access to treatment, and is not denied health care because they cannot pay for it or because of stigma.
In many countries, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people face discrimination in accessing health care. Human Rights Watch has
documented health care discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in countries including the US, Tanzania, Japan, Indonesia,
6/24/2021

9/11
Bangladesh, Russia, and Lebanon. Because some LGBT people, including men who have sex with men and transgender people, are at particularly high
risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV and may be less likely to have access to testing and treatment than other populations, they may have compromised
immunities and be particularly at risk of suffering serious illness or death as a result of COVID-19.
Governments should ensure that all healthcare services related to COVID-19 are provided without stigma and discrimination of any kind, including on
the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, and should make clear through public messaging campaigns that everyone has the right to access
health care.
Governments should take steps to create firewalls between healthcare providers and undocumented migrants to reassure vulnerable populations that
they do not risk reprisal or deportation if they access lifesaving care, especially in the context of seeking testing or treatment for COVID-19.
Governments should also ensure that financial barriers do not prevent people from accessing testing, preventative care, and treatment for COVID-19. In
the US, 28 million people do not have medical insurance and nearly a third of the country have difficulty affording payments for treatment even though
they are insured. Many people in the US report avoiding medical care or buying prescription medication because of cost, resulting in their condition
worsening. In an epidemic, avoidance of medical care not only harms those with the illness but also could lead to increased spread of coronavirus.
All governments have an obligation to ensure that a serious public health crisis does not also become a human rights crisis because people are unable to
access adequate medical care. Governments need to take steps to ensure everyone has affordable and accessible medical care and treatment options.
Protect community and civil society organizations
In many countries, civil society organizations are doing critical work to support efforts to stem the spread of the virus and ensure that those with COVID-
19 - or those living in isolation or under quarantine - have access to needed protection, care, and social services. Governments should protect and
support civil society organizations doing this work, as well as those reporting on the impacts of the outbreak.
During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, nongovernmental groups, local newspapers, and community radio played a key role in public health
education.
In Hong Kong, ordinary people have organized themselves to create and distribute masks and hand sanitizers to the most vulnerable to fill policy gaps.
But the Chinese government has long maintained a stranglehold on nongovernmental organizations and some groups are struggling with reduced
funding during the outbreak.
In Italy, authorities have subjected nongovernment sea rescue organizations assisting migrants and asylum seekers to quarantines at dock despite crew
members and passengers testing negative for the virus. In a context in which civilian rescue missions have been consistently undermined, blocked, and
even criminalized, potentially unnecessary quarantines might be used to deter rescue at sea.
Governments should not exploit the coronavirus pandemic to criminalize or obstruct the work of civil society organizations.
Promote the rights to water and sanitation
The rights to water and to sanitation are part of the right to an adequate standard of living. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
has reaffirmed that the rights to water and sanitation are an essential component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and integrally related,
among other Covenant rights, to the right to health.
Billions of people around the world do not have access to safe drinking water. Yet, as the WHO has noted the provision of safe water, sanitation, and
hygienic conditions is essential to protecting human health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Prevention of human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19
virus may be supported by promotion of the rights to water and sanitation, and supporting water and wastewater infrastructure and technicians to
ensure good and consistently applied water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and waste management practices in communities, homes, schools,
marketplaces, and healthcare facilities. More research is needed to understand the risk of contaminated drinking water, environmental transmission, and
how to ensure wastewater operators are trained and supported throughout the crisis.
Lack of potable water and sanitation at home, school, or in healthcare settings will make preventative measures difficult. In some cases, without
adequate water and sanitation these settings themselves may be a locus for the spread of the disease.
Venezuela's healthcare infrastructure is so weak that the most basic recommendation -handwashing - is difficult even for healthcare providers, who work
under difficult conditions. The Venezuelan doctors and nurses Human Rights Watch interviewed over the past few months said that soap and
disinfectants were virtually nonexistent in their clinics and hospitals. As inflation has risen and salaries have been devalued, it has become impossible for
them to bring in their own supplies. Public hospitals in Caracas, the capital, are also suffering regular water shortages. In remote hospitals, the
shortages have lasted weeks to months. Patients and personnel have been required to bring their own water for drinking and sometimes for flushing
toilets.
Governments should immediately suspend any water shutoffs for failure to pay. Discontinuing water services for failure to pay in any context is
incompatible with human rights and can be particularly harmful in the context of public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ensure humanitarian aid continues
According to the United Nations, a number of the many countries affected by COVID-19 are already facing crises due to conflicts, natural disasters, or
climate change. Many people in those crisis-hit countries rely on humanitarian aid to survive.
Governments should ensure that support for vital humanitarian operations carried out by the UN and other aid agencies does not suffer as a result of
COVID-19.

President Donald Trump said he did not believe the term ""kung-flu"" and other discriminatory phrases would put Asian Americans at risk of xenophobic
attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The disparaging term was privately used by a White House official to CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, a Chinese American, on Tuesday morning.
""I wonder who said that,"" Trump said to reporters at the White House on Wednesday. ""You know who said that? Say the term again.""
Trump said he did not believe Asian Americans would be negatively affected by the use of the phrase.
President Donald Trump said he did not believe the term ""kung-flu"" and other discriminatory phrases would put Asian Americans at risk of xenophobic
attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The disparaging term was privately used by a White House official to CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, a Chinese American, on Tuesday morning.
""Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back,"" Jiang said in a tweet.
Trump pressed for more details when he was asked if he believed Asian Americans could be subjected to increased racist attacks because of similar terms.
""I wonder who said that,"" Trump said to a reporter at the White House on Wednesday. ""You know who said that? Say the term again.""
After the reporter repeated the phrase, it was still not clear if Trump understood the belittling implication and the relationship it has with Asians.
Trump said he did not believe Asian Americans would be negatively affected by the use of the phrase, which he said had to do with coronavirus' origins in
China. Trump and numerous Republican lawmakers have described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus,"" based on the initial cases in the country. Critics —
including the Chinese government — have urged them not to use the term.
""No, not at all,"" Trump said. ""I think they'd probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There's nothing not to agree on.""
Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified in a congressional hearing earlier in March that he agreed it was
inappropriate to describe the virus as the ""Chinese coronavirus"" because it had spread across the world.
""Public health emergencies ... are stressful times for people and communities,"" the CDC wrote on its website. ""Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to
social stigma toward people, places, or things.""
""For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not
everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease,"" the CDC website said.
Several hate crimes and acts of discriminatory behavior against Asian Americans were documented across the US in recent weeks amid the coronavirus
pandemic. An Asian man who declined to be identified alleged a 44-year-old man named Raoul Ramos screamed at him on Saturday for not wearing a mask
while he was walking with his 10-year-old son in New York, the New York Post reported.
""The guy walked past us. That triggered him. He was screaming at us and said, 'Where the f--- is your mask?'"" the man said to the Post.

Two videos posted on Facebook on Wednesday showed a New York City subway rider yelling at an Asian man, telling him to move out of his way, and eventually spraying a
can of what appears to be Febreze at him.
The NYPD is investigating the incident, according to the New York Post.
Asian Americans have said they've been the victims of racist attacks because of the coronavirus outbreak that originated in China.
As Asian Americans say they're experiencing more incidents of racism amid the coronavirus outbreak, a worrying video surfaced on Wednesday showing an Asian man being
harassed on the New York City subway and being sprayed with a can of what appears to be Febreze.
Two videos showing the incident were posted on Facebook on Wednesday. The first showed a rider yelling at the Asian man and repeatedly ordering him to move. When people
on the train asked the man why he was asking the stranger to get out of his way, the man shouted, ""Because he's standing right f---ing next to me!""
The upset man then grabs a spray can and starts spraying it at the Asian man, who remained standing near the door of the subway car.
The second video showed the Asian man confronting the other man, asking: ""Why is that? Why can't I sit next to you?""
The New York Police Department confirmed to the New York Post on Thursday that the Hate Crimes Task Force was investigating. A representative said that someone called 911
to report the incident but that by the time officers arrived at the station the train had already departed, so no report was taken.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority retweeted the video on Thursday and described it as racist.
""What works in stopping the spread of Coronavirus: 1. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. 2. Cough and sneeze into your elbow. 3. Stay home if you're sick,"" the tweet
said. ""What doesn't work: 1. Racism.""

Since the novel coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, it has infected more than 95,000 people.
What's also spreading are xenophobic and racist attacks against people of Asian descent, including microaggressions, or indirect expressions of intolerance like rude
comments or dirty looks.
A number of Business Insider employees have experienced or witnessed microaggressions in recent weeks.
Josue David Cisneros, a University of Illinois professor who studies the link between racism and disease, said that America's history of anti-immigrant rhetoric plays a role.
A novel coronavirus outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, has killed more than 3,250 people and infected more than 95,000 on every continent except for Antarctica. (The
vast majority of cases are in China.) There have been at least 11 reported deaths in the US so far. But the disease isn't the only thing spreading.
Many Americans are already dealing with another kind of flare-up: xenophobia and racism. There have been reports of blatant verbal and physical attacks around the world,
from men trying to push a woman off her bike in the Netherlands, to a man in London being punched and kicked as he walked down the street. But what's impacting thousands
more people of Asian descent are microaggressions, or indirect expressions of intolerance.
In general, microaggressions are common. A recent survey by Glassdoor of 1,100 US employees found that 61% had witnessed or experienced workplace discrimination based
on age, race, gender, or LGBTQ identity. Add into the mix fear, rumors, and misinformation about a deadly, contagious disease, and the results are grim.
Although microaggressions can be subtle, their effects are real. Research published in the US National Library of Medicine from 2015 of 405 young adults of color found that
experiencing microaggressions increased incidence of depression and suicidal ideation.
Unfortunately, I didn't have to look any further than my colleagues to find examples of racism and xenophobia in recent weeks.
Bryan Pietsch, an editorial fellow at Business Insider who's Korean-American, got on the subway in Brooklyn Thursday morning. As soon as he boarded, a middle-aged woman
covered her mouth, glared at him, and then moved away.
""Her obviously covering her face and shooting me a dirty look just because I was standing near her made me feel disappointed,"" Pietsch said. ""It did make me concerned about
how other people were interpreting the situation. If they saw her doing that, did that make them more concerned about my presence in the crowded car?""
Emily Park, an animation fellow at Business Insider who's Korean-American, was on the subway in Manhattan on Monday when she cleared her throat. A woman stared at her
for several moments and then promptly got up and moved seats farther away.
""I'd heard of other Asian people experiencing something like this, but I hadn't yet, so it just felt kinda bad,"" Park said.
Alana Yzola, a senior producer at Business Insider, said she was recently in an Uber driving through Flushing, when her driver locked the doors and said ""there are a lot of
Chinese here, you have to be careful,"" apparently referring to catching the coronavirus, which they had been discussing. Uber is investigating the incident.
Jennifer Hernandez, a customer success specialist at Business Insider, was getting off the PATH train from New Jersey to New York City and boarding an elevator when, she said,
she witnessed a troubling interaction. She was on the elevator with 3 white males and one woman of Asian descent, all of them apparently strangers. The 3 men started talking
about the coronavirus, with one commenting about how the spread was likely related to ""all the disgusting food Chinese people eat."" The Asian woman became visibly
uncomfortable and upset, Hernandez said, eventually speaking up and defending Chinese food and culture.
Microaggressions toward people of Asian descent are becoming more common nationwide in the context of the coronavirus outbreak. A woman in South San Francisco sneezed
into her elbow in a hallway in a hospital, where she was getting a flu shot, when a middle-aged white woman yelled a racist slur at her, NPR reported. Kids in Ontario thought it
would be fun to play a game of testing one of their Asian peers for coronavirus, TIME reported. Some parents in Melbourne refused to let Asian doctors at one hospital treat
their kids. Across France, the hashtag ""#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus"" or ""I am not a virus"" has gained traction in response to a slew of racist comments and attacks. A similar hashtag,
""#NoSoyUnVirus"" has taken off in Spain.
Racism and xenophobia spreads with infectious diseases
What is it about the rise of an infectious disease that makes for the spread of xenophobia or racism? Josue David Cisneros, professor at University of Illinois at Urbana-
Champaign, has studied this phenomenon.

By calling the novel coronavirus the ""Chinese virus,"" it attaches an ethnicity to the virus that puts people of Asian descent at risk.
As of Thursday, the coronavirus had infected more than 244,000 people worldwide, with the global death toll surpassing 10,000.
The novel coronavirus first detected late last year in Wuhan, China, is officially called SARS-CoV-2, and it causes a disease known as COVID-19.
Despite the scientific classifications, some people have latched onto a different name for the coronavirus, one with racist implications: ""Chinese virus.""
This week, the ""PBS NewsHour"" correspondent Yamiche Alcindor asked President Donald Trump — a regular user of the term — whether he thought ""Chinese virus"" and the less
politically correct term ""Kung Flu"" might put Asian Americans at risk for racist attacks. The president said: ""Not at all. I think they probably would agree with it 100%. It comes
from China.""
Attaching the virus to an ethnicity, however, has caused people in the US of Asian descent to become targets of racism and xenophobia, with Chinese restaurants temporarily
closing because of a decrease in patronage, people being subject to hostile remarks, and, in some extreme cases, some Asians being physically assaulted.
—NYPD Hate Crimes (@NYPDHateCrimes) February 5, 2020
And it's not just the US where such acts of racism are being reported. An Asian man was assaulted in London as his attackers yelled: ""I don't want your coronavirus in my
country."" The British Chinese filmmaker Lucy Sheen tweeted in February that she was told to go back to China and to take her ""filth"" back with her.
A Chinese student in Adelaide, Australia, was attacked simply because he was speaking a different language while walking down the street.
Normalizing the association between the coronavirus and those of Asian descent will only cause further divide at a time when fear and distrust already run rampant.
The coronavirus initially was largely referred to by the news media as the ""Wuhan coronavirus,"" a not-unusual scenario in which a novel virus is colloquially named after its
place of origin (though the World Health Organization issued guidelines in 2015 advocating generic names for diseases). But while the coronavirus may have originated in
Wuhan, in the Chinese province of Hubei, it has since made its way to more than 160 countries and territories.
As of Thursday, the coronavirus had infected more than 244,000 people worldwide, with the global death toll surpassing 10,000. It has affected China. It has affected Italy. It
has affected Iran, Spain, Germany, the US, and more.
The virus is taking enough of a toll on friends, families, and communities — there's no reason for racism to add to that.

President Donald Trump has repeatedly referred to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus.""
Anthony Fauci, the US's top expert on infectious disease, on Sunday said he'd never use this phrase to describe the virus.
Critics say the president has only begun referring to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" to distract from his own failures in response to the pandemic.
Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top expert on infectious disease, on Sunday he would never refer to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus.""
As President Donald Trump has sought to rewrite the history of his early response to the coronavirus pandemic, he's shifted to calling it the ""Chinese virus."" This has been
widely decried as racist and a transparent attempt to distract from the Trump administration's failures and delayed reaction surrounding the pandemic.
Fauci was asked about this in an interview with Science Insider, and he said ""no"" when asked if would ever refer to coronavirus as the ""novel coronavirus.""
Question: You have not said China virus. [Trump frequently calls the cause of the spreading illness known as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a ""China
virus"" or a ""Chinese virus.""]
Fauci: Ever.
Question: And you never will, will you?
Fauci: No.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has urged against referring to the novel coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus,"" particularly as Asian Americans have reported
instances of discrimination and public harassment as the virus spreads in the US.
Robert Redfield, the director of the CDC, earlier this month said it is ""absolutely wrong and inappropriate"" to call COVID-19 the ""Chinese coronavirus.""
Moreover, the CDC's website states: ""People in the U.S. may be worried or anxious about friends and relatives who are living in or visiting areas where COVID-19 is spreading.
Some people are worried about the disease. Fear and anxiety can lead to social stigma, for example, towards Chinese or other Asian Americans or people who were in
quarantine...Stigma hurts everyone by creating more fear or anger towards ordinary people instead of the disease that is causing the problem.""
COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, originated in Wuhan, China. The Chinese government has been broadly criticized for suppressing information on the
spread of the virus, particularly early on. But it's also taken measures that have seemingly been successful in slowing the rate of new infections.
In January, Trump praised China's response to the novel coronavirus, but he's shifted to blaming China for the global spread while referring to it as the ""Chinese virus.""

Meanwhile, Fauci, a public health hero who's led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for over 30 years, has emerged as one of the most trusted voices in the
US amid the coronavirus pandemic.
But as coronavirus has spread acrosss the US, Fauci has had to walk a very fine line between keeping the public informed and calm, and not angering a president with a history
of lashing out at aides and officials who are seen as undermining him.
With that said, Trump has a tendency to embellish or spread outright false information, which can be dangerous during a pandemic. On more than one occasion, Fauci has
stepped up and contradicted or corrected statements made by the president.

As the coronavirus continues to spread in the United States, the Trump administration is fielding criticism from some public health officials, politicians and Asian Americans for
labeling the illness a ""Chinese virus"", a term that experts argued is inaccurate and has led to increased incidents of racist attacks against Asians of different ethnicities.
""The president of the United States, and other White House officials, using the term 'Chinese virus', or 'Kung-Flu', or 'Wuhan virus', we believe is inciting and provoking this anti-
Asian sentiment and is really responsible in the rise of these more violent acts,"" said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, a community-based
civil rights organization in San Francisco.
""He's refusing to call it by its correct medical name, which is COVID-19, or the coronavirus. He's refusing to do that, even after it was called to his attention that this is harming
and endangering the lives of Asian Americans,"" she added.
As of Sunday, 201 deaths and over 15,200 cases had been reported in the US, according to the World Health Organization.
In response to the increasingly frequent harassment resulting from the coronavirus, Choi's organization, along with the Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council and the San
Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department, have launched a reporting center to track cases of discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders
throughout the country.
The center opened on Thursday, and by Friday, it had already received 60 reports of cases from community members on the site, Choi said.
One of the cases involves a 12-year-old Asian American boy in the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, who was so badly beaten by middle school classmates that he had to
visit the hospital emergency room.
Another case occurred just a few days ago. It revolved around a Chinese woman who found herself accosted on the street by a stranger who cursed at her and blamed her for
bringing the coronavirus to the US.
On March 14, a man from Myanmar and his young son were two of four people stabbed by a man at a grocery store in Midland, Texas. Although this case still warrants further
investigation, Choi said she found out through her network that racism and coronavirus motivated the attack.
""We are starting to see a pattern that individuals who might not appear to be likely to defend themselves, or unable to defend themselves, are being targeted. We are seeing all
kinds of racially derogatory comments being made toward people,"" she added.
The violence has spiraled so out of hand that David Liu, the owner of Arcadia Firearm & Safety in San Gabriel Valley, an area with a high concentration of Chinese immigrants,
said gun sales at his store were 10 times the usual amount in the past three weeks, with many customers buying firearms to protect themselves against possible racial attacks
and fear of social disorder caused by the coronavirus.
Trump defended his use of the term on Wednesday, saying ""it's not racist at all"", he told reporters. ""It comes from China, that is why.""
However, cases of a strange, severe pneumonia were witnessed last November in Italy before the world even became aware of the COVID-19 outbreak in China, said Giuseppe
Remuzzi, an Italian physician.
In an interview with National Public Radio, Remuzzi said some family doctors told him that they had seen the pneumonia, particularly in old people, in December and even in
November.
""It means that the virus was circulating at least in Lombardy before we were aware of this outbreak occurring in China.""
Meanwhile, such terms have elicited a chorus of criticism from public figures, including former secretary of state Hillary Clinton, who argued that Trump is using racist rhetoric to
distract from his administration's delay in preparing the country for the pandemic.
""The president is turning to racist rhetoric to distract from his failures to take the coronavirus seriously early on, make tests widely available, and adequately prepare the
country for a period of crisis. Don't fall for it. Don't let your friends and families fall for it,"" she wrote on her Twitter account on Wednesday.
Analysts outside the US also believe that Trump's intentional use of the racist term is to distract the US public from the wide criticism of his missteps in his early denial of the
seriousness of the pandemic. Now with the stock market gains of the past three years totally wiped out, he is eager to play the blame game, especially in a presidential election

A new center for Asian Americans to report offensive behavior, including assaults, related to the novel coronavirus outbreak has received more than 500 submissions within four
days, offering a glimpse into the extent of racism and bigotry affecting the community.
""We now have over 500 incident reports. They have been provided in English, simplified and traditional Chinese, Thai, Japanese and Korean. Just today, we added Vietnamese,""
said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, or A3PCON.
The Los Angeles-based community group and the San Francisco-based advocacy organization Chinese for Affirmative Action opened the reporting center on Thursday to allow
Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to report incidents of hate, which have been surging as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads.
Half of the cases are from outside California, ranging from shunning to verbal harassment, according to Kulkarni.
""Some of the more shocking ones are where somebody is throwing a bottle at someone. It looks like just in the last few hours we've gotten a case where somebody in New York
was punched by another individual, so actually physically beaten,"" she said.
The cases will be used for assistance, advocacy and education purposes, she said.
Some US officials and lawmakers have repeatedly used the term ""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"", even though the World Health Organization has a naming rule that prohibits
linking a virus to a particular geographic location or group of people to avoid stigma.
As the terminology can falsely associate Asian Americans with the disease, Kulkarni said the labeling is putting people in harm's way.
While trying to stay safe and healthy, as other US citizens are doing, Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders are facing increasing anxieties and fears whenever they leave their
homes to go to the grocery store, the pharmacy or even just to get outside for a walk, she said.
""This is a time that we need to come together to help each other out,"" Kulkarni said.
David Bernstein, president and CEO of the Jewish Council for Public Affairs, also opposed the use of what he called ""this unfortunate term"".
""It endangers Chinese and Asian Americans who are feeling the effects of rising bigotry,"" Bernstein said. ""We are organizing a Jewish and Asian American letter to the president
and will issue it shortly.
""We worry both about the breakdown in international cooperation, at a time when we need it the most, and the impact it will have on vulnerable populations here in the US.""
On Monday, US President Donald Trump tweeted: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world.
Kulkarni said she was glad to see the shift in the president's message, ""though we are concerned that significant damage was already done"".
""We hope this is not a temporary change, as some other more measured comments and corrections have been in the past,"" she said.

202102,
202102,"
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has had no problem denouncing critics in the past who have blown an anti-Asian dog whistle.
Which is why On Politics asked the senator's office this week what he thought of President Donald Trump using the term ""China virus"" or ""Chinese virus"" in remarks about
COVID-19.
""Our country is in the midst of a health and economic challenge,"" said McConnell spokeswoman Stephanie Penn.
I was reminded by Penn how — as majority leader — McConnell is spearheading a bold and comprehensive package to deliver relief for Kentuckians.
""This isn't the time for petty squabbling, but for every American to come together to do their part,"" Penn concluded.
Asian American advocacy organizations and other researchers don't have firm figures, but they point to a hike in reports about verbal threats and physical assaults targeting
their minority group.
A report by San Francisco State University, for example, cited that there was an uptick in reports of discrimination against Asian Americans in the ""form of shunning, harassment
and physical assaults.""
Zhizhi ""Wit"" Wang, who lives in Lexington, said Trump's hurtful language shouldn't be dismissed by McConnell as ""petty squabbling.""
""I think it's a racist comment,"" he said. ""We would never call Ebola the 'African virus.'""
The 25-year-old University of Kentucky graduate student, who is studying finance, immigrated to the U.S. more than a decade ago. He said Chinese Americans and other
Kentuckians of Asian descent feel they are being blamed for a global pandemic.
Wang said he hasn't heard about any violence or verbal threats in Lexington, which has an Asian population of less than 4%, according to census data. But he is troubled by the
national headlines coming from parts of the country where more Asian Americans live.
The Kentuckian pleaded with McConnell and others to think about the consequences of Trump's language.
""What is the difference if you just call it coronavirus versus 'Chinese virus?'"" Wang asked. ""He could have avoided this entire mess but he did not choose to do so.""
McConnell certainly didn't bite his tongue when past players in Kentucky politics have used this race card to animate their attacks against him.
During the 2014 Senate campaign, a liberal super PAC called Progress Kentucky alluded to his wife Elaine Chao — who now serves as Trump's transportation secretary — and
her Chinese background when criticizing McConnell about letting U.S. jobs move overseas.
The McConnell campaign fired back quickly at the time, and blasted the group for ""race-baiting"" voters. It did the same when a Democratic consultant referred to Chao, who
came to the U.S. from China as a child, as being Asian and not a native Kentuckian.
Team Mitch had zilch to say when asked about Trump's ""Chinese virus"" comments this week, even as old foes acknowledge the mistake.
""The senator and secretary were on the right side of history in calling out Progress Kentucky's racist tweets, just as I was on the wrong side for trivializing the harm they
caused,"" said Curtis Morrison, an attorney and former Progress Kentucky volunteer. ""It is sad to watch now as they tolerate the same racism when it comes from the president.""
Morrison figures Trump is just too powerful and too important for McConnell to criticize in public.
The GOP leader didn't refrain from calling out Republican Everett Corley two years ago when it was discovered the small-time state legislative candidate appeared on a white
nationalist radio show where the host criticized McConnell's interracial marriage.
""This racist behavior is completely despicable,"" McConnell said in 2018. ""Such backwards views and hateful rhetoric must be given no corner in the Republican Party or
anywhere in America.""

At a news conference Wednesday, Trump defended his use of the phrase when asked by reporters if he was being bigoted in saying ""Chinese virus.""
""It's not racist at all,"" Trump said to reporters. ""No, not at all. It comes from China. That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""
Like many others, Chinese Americans in metro Detroit are anxious about the spread of coronavirus, but they and others of Asian descent are also worried about racist backlash.
""People are afraid,"" Shenlin Chen, said president of the Association of Chinese Americans (ACA), a group based in Madison Heights that advocates for Chinese Americans.
""People have fear about being discriminated against or treated unfairly.""
Since the spread of the coronavirus, there have been reports of Chinese Americans and other Asian American groups perceived to be Chinese being racially attacked or
ostracized. In metro Detroit two weeks ago, an elderly Chinese American had his grocery cart spat on by someone, Chen said.
And now, they're concerned this week about how President Donald Trump is increasingly using the phrase ""Chinese virus"" in his tweets and public remarks. Founded in 1972,
the Association of Chinese Americans was expected to release a statement on Thursday criticizing Trump and others who use that phrase.
""As it is plainly clear, there is no reason to attach a racial or ethnic or country moniker on a virus pandemic,"" a draft copy of the statement reads. ""The Covid-19 is present in all
of the 50 states of the United States, is prevalent throughout Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Covid-19 does not recognize political borders. ... Attaching a racial, ethnic, or
country name to a virus, even informally, serves only to flame the fears and biases of people against Chinese and those of Asian background to no benefit in the battle against
the virus pandemic.""
The statement added: ""We should all work to avoid the misleading terms that detract from our common interest in working to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.""
On Wednesday, Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a tweet that ""Trump is attempting to incite hatred, violence and discrimination against Chinese Americans. We won't
tolerate it in Michigan. Report all suspected hate crimes to your local police dept or to our Hate Crimes Unit. 313-456-0200.""
State Sen. Stephanie Chang, D-Detroit, tweeted on Wednesday: ""Just a little reminder to not discriminate, attack, or promote hate during #COVID2019. The virus is a virus. It
does not have a race or ethnicity.""
On Tuesday, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., wrote on Twitter: ""Bigotry against people of Asian descent is unacceptable, un-American, & harmful to our COVID-19
response efforts."" Hillary Clinton called Trump's remarks ""racist rhetoric"" and Joe Biden slammed them as ""xenophobic fear-mongering.""
At a news conference Wednesday, Trump defended his use of the phrase when asked by reporters if he was being bigoted in saying ""Chinese virus.""
""It's not racist at all,"" Trump said to reporters. ""No, not at all. It comes from China. That's why. It comes from China. I want to be accurate.""
Also on Wednesday, U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, made comments seen as racist when he said ""China is to blame because the culture where people eat bats and snakes and
dogs and things like that.""
There are about 61,000 residents in Michigan of Chinese ancestry, according to 2018 Census figures.
""There is a concern about how people react when we are in various establishments and crowds,"" said Northville attorney Roland Hwang, secretary of the Association of Chinese
Americans and a teacher of Asian American studies at the University of Michigan.
The 1982 murder of Vincent Chin, of Chinese descent, in Highland Park by autoworkers angry at Japanese people the integration of the workforce, is still remembered by many
Asian Americans in metro Detroit.
They're worried about any resurgence of anti-Asian racism.
Hwang helped found American Citizens for Justice, an Asian American advocacy group in metro Detroit created after Chin's murder to bring justice for Chin and raise awareness
of anti-Asian racism.
""I'm really alarmed by Trump calling the virus a Chinese virus,"" Hwang said. ""There is no geographic, political subdivision, racial or ethnic limitation with respect to the virus.""

So, when the 17-year-old Royal Palm Beach resident stopped by Dairy Queen last week, she was confused when another customer told her to ""go to a Chinese restaurant."" 
It took the teenager a moment to realize what was happening.  
""It wasn't just an off-comment where you say, that was kind of rude,"" McDonald said. ""It was actually very pointed and very racist.""  
McDonald grew up in the United States, adopted at the age of one by an Irish-American family. Forgiving and unassuming, she was not accustomed to being singled out -- and
even less so to being verbally insulted. 
""I'm not a very reactive person,"" McDonald said. ""I don't process it, I'm not expecting it, I'm not waiting for someone to say something like that."" 
That is changing in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Advocacy organizations around the United States worry the health crisis will stoke bias and discrimination against
Americans who immigrated from Asian countries as well as those of Asian descent. 
Incidents of hate and violence have spiked so much that the website Teaching Tolerance has dedicated a section to teaching students how to speak up against racism related to
coronavirus. And the organization Chinese for Affirmative Action now tracks assaults via voluntary reporting on its website.  
Hundreds of cases have been recorded. Thousands more, particularly those occurring on social media, continue unabated. It is a reality McDonald and her family are now forced
to accept. 
Concerns also surged to the forefront of national conversations after President Donald Trump's statements and tweets labeling the illness as the ""Chinese virus."" A White House
official also reportedly called the virus the ""kung-flu"" while a Republican lawmaker referred to it as the ""Wuhan flu."" 
The end result, intended or not, has filtered down to Main Street America. 
""I realize I have to start almost being mentally prepared for that so I can react,"" McDonald said. 
Nancy Norton, McDonald's mother, said she is shocked by the behavior of people in her own community. She said she now fears for her daughter's safety. 
""She's not allowed to go out without me or her sister shadowing her,"" Norton said. ""If something happens, they are going to have to get through us first."" 
Reports of assaults on Asian-Americans have been documented worldwide since January, as the flu spread far beyond its place of origin in China. But they spiked after Trump
began using nicknames for the virus that implied Chinese people were somehow to blame, said John C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC. 
""We're now getting somewhere between five to six reports a day,"" Yang said. ""These incidents are not just verbal, but include physical assaults."" 
On Monday, after being pressed by the White House press corps about criticism by advocacy groups about his use of the term ""Chinese flu,"" Trump conceded that verbal taunts,
slurs and violence toward Asian-Americans are unacceptable. 
Trump later tweeted: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world. They are amazing people, and
the spreading of the Virus ...... is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. WE WILL PREVAIL TOGETHER!"" he wrote in a
series of tweets. 
But the president did not back down from his use of the term, nor did he accept responsibility for spurring stigmatization of Asian-Americans in using it. 
For those on the front lines of the fight against racism, Trump's condemnation of bias toward Asian-Americans provided little solace. 
""We think it is better late than never that he spoke out against violence against Asian-American's, but it is unfortunate that it took him so long to do so,"" Yang said.

Daniel Dae Kim, Lana Condor, Mark Ruffalo, Henry Golding, George Takei, Celeste Ng and Jonathan Van Ness are among
Hollywood stars who are taking to social media to denounce racism toward Asian Americans fuelled by the coronavirus
outbreak.
Kim, the ‘Lost’ and ‘Hawaii Five-0’ star, shed a light on the issue before and after revealing he tested positive for COVID-19.
Prior to his Thursday announcement video, Kim explained on Twitter that he had originally been “silent in the face of the blatant
acts of racism against Asian people” because “there have been so many it’s been too heartbreaking to comment on.”
Later going public with his diagnosis, Kim had a message for anyone using the pandemic as an excuse to aim hatred at people
of Asian descent.
“Please, please stop the prejudice and senseless violence against Asian people,” he said in a video, calling out “certain political
leaders,” such as President Donald Trump, who have falsely dubbed the illness the “Chinese virus.”
“Randomly beating elderly — sometimes homeless — Asian Americans is cowardly, heartbreaking, and it’s inexcusable. Yes, I’m
Asian, and yes, I have coronavirus, but I did not get it from China ... I don’t consider the place where it’s from as important as
the people who are sick and dying.”
‘To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before’ star Condor also appeared to slam Trump indirectly on Twitter Wednesday while urging her
followers to “be safe.”
“You have no idea the ramifications your racist words & actions have on the Asian American community,” she wrote. “You simply
cannot even fathom the danger you are putting the community in. How dare you. You should be ashamed of yourself. You call
yourself a leader?
“Please. Be better. So we aren’t afraid to leave our house in fear someone will verbally or physically abuse us because of your
xenophobia.”

202102,"
To the ears of Asian Americans, the escalating crisis of the novel coronavirus in the United States is set against two horrible sounds.
One is the high-pitched wail of a mounting infection rate and an economy in free fall, as thousands more people are diagnosed every day and hundreds of thousands
lose their jobs.
The other is the low drumbeat of anti-Asian racism. It’s a background noise growing louder, as President Donald Trump and many Republicans have tried to drown out
critiques of their own bad decisions by refocusing blame on China and Chineseness.
This has had immediate, terrifying consequences for Asian Americans who could be perceived to be Chinese, and it’s a narrative that we will struggle to resist on our
own. Though reactions to this scapegoating show how divorced Asian Americans have become from the solidarity we need — and why belief in our own exceptionalism
was a trap.
-
Over the past two weeks, many Republicans pivoted to insist on the term “Chinese virus” at every opportunity. It was just the latest chapter in the Trump
administration’s standoff with the Chinese government — an oppressive regime that does deserve criticism for its handling of the outbreak, whose officials have falsely
suggested that the new coronavirus came from the United States.
The changes that the coronavirus has wrought are so overwhelming, a photo of people standing close to each other already feels like a missive from another planet. So
it’s easy to understand how this latest flare of bigotry could be seen in a vacuum: new era, new kind of racism.
19th century propaganda
The only historical reference points that the media seem to use are those that involve Asians — Japanese internment, or late 19th century propaganda about “yellow
peril.” I’ve even seen some of my fellow Asian Americans try to redirect the hatred, complaining that they’re being targeted despite not being Chinese, or that it’s
stupid to be racist because South Korea and Taiwan have done such a good job at containing the virus.
This is a blinkered narrative. What is horrifying about coronavirus racism is not that it is new, or that it hits the “wrong” Asians. It is that what’s being targeted at Asian
Americans — what the Trump administration has mindlessly enabled — is part of the ongoing story of American bigotry.
Asian Americans have sometimes struggled to understand our place within the wider landscape of race, bamboozled by the “model minority” myth pushed by white
politicians. As the historian Ellen Wu has written, the idea that Chinese Americans in particular were high-achieving and compliant was exploited first to bolster an
alliance with China during World War II, then spun to discredit the black civil rights movement.
(A movement from which, ironically, all Asian Americans greatly benefited.) The model minority term is one of American white supremacy’s most successful campaigns,
simultaneously driving a wedge between Asian Americans and other people of colour and alienating us from our own right to dissent. What did we have to complain
about, anyway?
Then there’s the term Asian American itself, a civil rights-inspired creation of the 1960s that has never managed to contain all the identities it was supposed to hold. A
fourth-generation Chinese American shares little family history with a first-generation Cambodian immigrant — and the knowledge that many non-Asians don’t know or
care about the difference can feel like an insult.
'Chinese virus'
We are an ethnically diffuse, low-voting group, wildly divided in economic class and too concentrated on the coasts to have any real impact on national elections. We
are not, and have never been, a powerful united front. That’s part of why it’s so easy for Trump to call it the “Chinese virus,” wounding us all: Electorally, it won’t even
hurt him.

""These are challenging times for everyone, and we need to band together, not harass or discriminate anyone of any culture in regards to what is happening now.""
Dennis Nayor
Ithaca police chief
As the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Tompkins County have increased to six, Ithaca officials are also dealing with a possible rise in prejudice toward Asians and
Asian-Americans.
Cornell University officials first expressed concerns last month in a statement telling the college community to ""not make assumptions about others' perceived symptoms or any
characteristics of identity"" when students were tested for COVID-19 and isolated before the results came back negative.
While no positive cases were confirmed at the time at Cornell, two members of the Ithaca College community have since tested positive in the past week.
Ithaca Mayor Svante Myrick said Wednesday he heard two direct accounts of acts of verbal harassment directed at an Asian person and an Asian-American. He also said a third
party told him of another incident in which someone verbally assaulted another individual.
Myrick said these type of incidents will be investigated by the City of Ithaca if they are reported, but Ithaca Police Chief Dennis Nayor said not all of the previous incidents were
reported.
In the City of Ithaca, 17.6% of the population identifies as Asian, according to 2017 U.S. Census data. Of the 5,406, 9% are Chinese. Much of the large Asian population is tied
to the local colleges.
The coronavirus pandemic traces back to Wuhan, China, where it was discovered late last year. Its origin has led President Donald Trump to label the pathogen the ""Chinese
virus"" and the disease the ""Wuhan flu,"" which has led to strong criticism because experts say this rhetoric empowers racism.
""I sent the message (Tuesday) because we have to nip it in the bud,"" said Myrick, who said harassment directed toward those of Asian descent increased from zero to at least
three this week.
""(Wednesday), Trump tweeted 'Chinese coronavirus.' He's attempting to rebrand it by calling it the Chinese virus even though there's no reason to do so.
""He's trying to deflect blame. He thinks if we attach an ethnicity to the virus, (his response to COVID-19) will not change the election. This is an irresponsible, horrible form of
politics that's never been seen before. Labeling an entire ethnicity with a disease has led to the biggest atrocities and genocides.""
Myrick shared a message on Facebook condemning the acts of prejudice and Trump's rhetoric.
The mayor has advised residents to share messages stating the Ithaca community will not tolerate hate. He suggested residents can do so with signs and on social media.
""Make your own message that racism and hate in this moment is the very last thing we need, and it won't be allowed or tolerated in the City of Ithaca,"" Myrick said in the video.
Tompkins County Legislator Chair Leslyn McBean-Clairborne shared similar sentiments at Tuesday's legislature meeting.
Clairborne said, ""Please be sensitive. Stop that behavior, and if you see it ... interrupt it and provide support to those being harassed.""
Racism toward Asian people has increased throughout the country recently, with metro areas such as Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle reporting more incidents.
Ithaca police aware of harassment
During the incidents in Ithaca, the individuals were followed, and comments about coronavirus and COVID-19 were directed toward them.
""This is not just occurring in different places around the country,"" Nayor said by phone. ""It is occurring locally as well. ... we won't tolerate that.
""These are challenging times for everyone, and we need to band together, not harass or discriminate anyone of any culture in regards to what is happening now.""

The new coronavirus is spreading fast around the world and so is racism against Asian people.
TV personality and Korean-American lawyer Suh Dong-joo, 36, lashed out at the increasing number of racially motivated attacks against Koreans and other Asians in the United
States amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
'Do you want us to wear a mask or not wear a mask? I'm getting mixed messages here,' Suh, who lives in San Francisco, wrote on Instagram. 'If Asians get beat up for both
wearing a mask and not, what do you expect us to do?'
The comment comes five days after she posted the photo of herself wearing a face mask, saying she was concerned about growing racism.
Asians see increase in racially motivated attacks against them
As the virus from the Chinese city of Wuhan continues to affect people around the world, concerns have been growing over xenophobic and racist attacks against people
'whoever look Chinese.'
Earlier in February, a video posted on Twitter of a women wearing a mask being punched, kicked and called a 'diseased b****' by a man in a New York City subway went viral.
On Feb. 24, Jonathan Mok, a 23-year-old Singaporean, was attacked while walking down the streets in London by a group of four men who said: 'we don't want your
coronavirus in our country.' The attack resulted in a broken bone near his eye.
On Mar. 6, another disturbing video was widely circulated on social media, in which a black man sprayed Febreeze air freshener at an Asian guy after having an argument on a
New York City train.

202102,"
Dr. Xinyu Zhao noticed that his son appeared upset after coming home one early March evening after school, as new coronavirus cases were just starting to spike in New York.
Later that evening, Zhao learned from his son that, in front of the whole class and a teacher, a fellow fifth-grader had told the boy to ""go back to your country and tell your
people to stop eating bats and rats.""
Only four years ago Zhao, a gastroenterologist who works in Flushing, moved his family to Long Island, in part for his children to study in the Manhasset School District. The
father of two said the incident greatly disturbed his son and sent home crying another Asian American child who witnessed the scene. After the parents reported it to school
officials, the student who made the statement apologized.
But in the following days, before the school closed, Zhao felt somewhat uneasy when dropping his son off in the morning.
""I didn't know if he's going to have another incident at school, if somebody else would say something to him,"" said Zhao, 51. ""I never felt concerned to send my kids to school.
But I feel very concerned now.""
As the coronavirus continues to spread rapidly, members of the Asian American community have grown increasingly anxious over what they feel is a backlash against them
because the pandemic originated in China.
Wai-Lin Ng, who was born in Hong Kong and emigrated to the United States when she was a child, had never felt the sting of discrimination - until recently in a Rocky Point
supermarket.
""This was during the time when there was a lot of panic-buying at the stores, with shelves emptying out,"" said Ng, who has worked at the Brookhaven National Laboratory for
three decades. ""There was a woman passing by, and I saw her staring at me, and she basically pulled up her scarf over her nose and mouth.""
Ng, 56, of Sound Beach, at first thought it was just her imagination, then came to realize the meaning of the woman's actions. She realized she had never experienced anything
like that before, having lived on Long Island for most of her adult life.
""It's not overt,"" she said. But, she added, ""we don't want to get beyond that. ... I think any ethnic group could potentially feel that they're targeted. But if it escalates, it could
become a problem.""
Some in the Asian American community and experts have pointed to anecdotal accounts and news reports of a rising number of verbal and physical attacks nationwide.
Nassau and Suffolk police said this week that they have not received any reports of verbal or physical attacks targeting Asians on Long Island. But the NYPD this week said that
the department has investigated 10 cases where Asians were victimized in incidents related to the outbreak, making six arrests so far. 
Earlier this month, a 44-year-old man was charged with aggravated harassment as a hate crime after he allegedly yelled profanities and hit a man over the head at a bus stop
in Queens. The NYPD Hate Crimes Task Force last month also retweeted a video showing an Asian woman being attacked in a Manhattan subway station, asking the victim to
report the incident so that an investigation could ensue.
In the past few weeks, Christine Liu, a board member of the Chinese American Association of North Hempstead and the Herricks Chinese Association, said she has heard of
more than a dozen reports of harassment and discrimination against Asians in Nassau County. 
She knew of no physical attacks against Asians on Long Island. The cases she heard of ranged from minor incidents including Asian children noticing other students moving
away from them on a school bus after they coughed, to serious ones such as a man yelling at an Asian man when he took a walk with his wife and daughters in New Hyde Park. 
""A lot of Asians as well as other minorities are very fearful,"" said Liu, 40, of New Hyde Park. ""It only takes somebody who's mentally unstable to blame somebody in the Asian
community and do something about it.""
Asian parents are also struggling to help their children cope with the newfound reality in the era of a deepening crisis.
David Chiang's grade-school-age children told him that they've heard others say ""don't hang out with the Asians if you don't want coronavirus.""

Lili McDonald likes ice cream.
So, when the 17-year-old Royal Palm Beach resident stopped by Dairy Queen last week, she was confused when another customer told her to “go to a Chinese restaurant.”
It took the teenager a moment to realize what was happening.
“It wasn’t just an off-comment where you say, that was kind of rude,” McDonald said. “It was actually very pointed and very racist.”
McDonald grew up in the United States, adopted at the age of 1 by an Irish-American family. Forgiving and unassuming, she was not accustomed to being singled out — and
even less so to being verbally insulted.
“I’m not a very reactive person,” McDonald said. “I don’t process it, I’m not expecting it, I’m not waiting for someone to say something like that.”
That is changing in the era of the coronavirus pandemic. Advocacy organizations around the United States worry the health crisis will stoke bias and discrimination against
Americans who immigrated from Asian countries as well as those of Asian descent.
Incidents of hate and violence have spiked so much that the website Teaching Tolerance has dedicated a section to teaching students how to speak up against racism related to
coronavirus. And the organization Chinese for Affirmative Action now tracks assaults via voluntary reporting on its website.
Hundreds of cases have been recorded. Thousands more, particularly those occurring on social media, continue unabated. It is a reality McDonald and her family are now forced
to accept.
Concerns also surged to the forefront of national conversations after President Donald Trump’s statements and tweets labeling the illness as the “Chinese virus.”
A White House official also reportedly called the virus the “kung-flu” while a Republican lawmaker referred to it as the “Wuhan flu.”
The end result, intended or not, has filtered down to Main Street America.
“I realize I have to start almost being mentally prepared for that so I can react,” McDonald said.
Nancy Norton, McDonald’s mother, said she is shocked by the behavior of people in her own community. She said she now fears for her daughter’s safety.
“She’s not allowed to go out without me or her sister shadowing her,” Norton said. “If something happens, they are going to have to get through us first.”
Reports of assaults on Asian-Americans have been documented worldwide since January, as the flu spread far beyond its place of origin in China. But they spiked after Trump
began using nicknames for the virus that implied Chinese people were somehow to blame, said John C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC.
“We’re now getting somewhere between five to six reports a day,” Yang said. “These incidents are not just verbal, but include physical assaults.”
On Monday, after being pressed by the White House press corps about criticism by advocacy groups about his use of the term “Chinese flu,” Trump conceded that verbal taunts,
slurs and violence toward Asian-Americans are unacceptable.

When President Donald Trump stood before the microphone during a White House briefing about the coronavirus on Wednesday in which he declared himself a ""wartime
president,"" it only required a slight adjustment of reality as far as he was concerned.
He had already laid the groundwork in a press conference the day before when he told reporters that contrary to what they had seen, heard and reported for weeks, he never
called the coronavirus a ""hoax.""
""This is a pandemic,"" he said Tuesday. ""I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do was look at other countries.""
Mr. Trump assumed that just because the heads of the reporters didn't explode from the weight of sheer cognitive dissonance, his Jedi mind trick had somehow worked. It
hadn't.
Everyone knew that every word he said was in direct conflict with reality. With several members of the coronavirus task force flanking him, Mr. Trump declared war on an
""invisible enemy"" he could barely acknowledge weeks before.
So on Wednesday, the task force did not applaud or pin epaulettes on Mr. Trump's shoulder, but they did not embarrass him with gentle rebukes for wasting weeks of precious
time that has endangered the public's health, either.
After only a few weeks of working with the Trump administration, these learned men and women have already taken the lessons of George Orwell's ""1984"" to heart: ""The past
was alterable. The past has never been altered. Oceania was at war with Eurasia; therefore, Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.""
While Mr. Trump's position on the legitimacy of fears concerning the coronavirus could charitably be described as ""fungible"" over time, he and his allies have been remarkably
consistent about one element - the open embrace of anti-Asian xenophobia and racism for geopolitical advantage.
While everyone is keenly aware of Mr. Trump's clumsy attempts to distract from his administration's incompetence in rallying the nation and marshaling its resources to combat
COVID-19, his attempts to racially brand a global disease still can't go unaddressed.
Racism matters. It is only those who have benefited most from the privileges afforded by racism who insist with a straight face that ""rising to the Trump administration's bait""
by even objecting to it at this time endangers the public health.
It is possible to do two things at once - call out the president's incompetence while also pointing out his racism and those of his surrogates who are trying to rebrand COVID-19
the ""Chinese virus"" in the middle of a global pandemic.
Bear in mind, these are members of a political party that, until a few days ago, wasn't willing to entertain the possibility that COVID-19 was anything more than an elaborate
media hoax concocted to embarrass Mr. Trump, tank the economy and steal the election for the Democrats.
Sen. John Cornyn, one of Texas' two Republican senators, spelled it out for a reporter who quizzed him about the cost of demonizing Asians in a land that has been historically
intolerant of them, especially during pandemics.
""That's where it came from,"" Mr. Cornyn said, as if geographic origin was anything more than a twirl of the dice. ""I think China is to blame because the culture where people eat
bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses
like SARS, like MERS, the Swine flu, and now the coronavirus,"" he said. ""So I think they have a fundamental problem, and I don't object to geographically identifying where it's
coming from.""
Mr. Cornyn and his ilk would've objected strongly if the strain of deadly Creutzfeldt-Jakob bovine disease, otherwise known as ""Mad Cow disease,"" that re-emerged on an
American farm and in Canada in 2003, had been re-dubbed ""North American Mad Cow disease."" That's because the Republican senator and all of those eager to paint a

A top World Health Organisation (WHO) official on Wednesday condemned the use of language that could stigmatise certain ethnic groups over the coronavirus outbreak, as US
President Donald Trump defended his adoption of the term ""Chinese virus"".
""It's really important that we be careful in the language we use lest it leads to profiling of individuals associated with the virus,"" said Mike Ryan, the head of the WHO's health
emergency programmes. ""This is just something we need to all avoid.""
As the Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed nearly 9,000 lives, swept through the world, verbal and physical attacks against ethnic Chinese people and others of East Asian
descent have swelled.
On Tuesday, Weijia Jiang, a White House correspondent for CBS News, said an administration official had used the term ""Kung-Flu"" in front of her.
""I'm sure anyone would regret profiling a virus along an ethnic line,"" Ryan, who did not mention Trump by name, said on Wednesday.
Briefing reporters on Wednesday with updates in what he called his administration's ""war against the Chinese virus"", Trump was grilled by several journalists over whether such
language could fuel rising xenophobic attacks against Asian-Americans.
""It's not racist at all, no,"" he said. ""It comes from China, that's why.""
Trump, who has repeatedly rejected any criticism of his administration's response to the Covid-19 outbreak, said that Asian-Americans ""would probably agree with [the term]
100 per cent"".
Such language, which contravenes WHO guidelines against the use of geographical terms in naming diseases, has elicited a wave of criticism from the US public, advocacy
groups and lawmakers - including, contrary to Trump's estimations, Asian-Americans.
Congresswoman Judy Chu, a Democrat from California, secured a commitment last month from Trump's secretary of health and human services, Alex Azar, to refrain from
calling it ""China coronavirus"".
""We must ensure that nobody is discriminated against based on ethnicity,"" Azar said during a US House hearing. ""Ethnicity is not what causes the coronavirus.""
Former US vice-president Joe Biden, who likely will be Trump's opponent in the November election, also criticised the president's continued use of the term ""Chinese virus"".
""Stop the xenophobic fearmongering. Be honest. Take responsibility. Do your job,"" Biden tweeted on Wednesday.
Trump had previously referred to the contagion as the ""coronavirus"" or ""the virus"", but that changed on Monday amid remarks by Chinese diplomats who, citing conspiracy
theories, suggested that the contagion could have been brought to China by US soldiers competing in the Military World Games in Wuhan in October.
Trump said on Wednesday that such claims were unacceptable. ""That can't happen. It's not going to happen, not as long as I'm president."" The spat has intensified tensions
between Washington and Beijing at a time when WHO officials are calling for a unified global response to the pandemic.
""This is a time for solidarity, this is a time for facts,"" Ryan said.
""All that we need now is to be able to identify the things we need to do to move forward quickly with speed, with certainty and to avoid any indication of ethnic or other
associations of this virus.""
When asked on Wednesday about the purported usage of ""Kung-Flu"" by a White House official, White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said that Jiang, the CBS reporter, should
reveal the name of the official, who was not speaking on record. Deflecting further questioning over the alleged incident, she said: ""I'm married to an Asian.""
Later in the morning, George Conway - her husband and a fierce Trump critic - began sharing posts on Twitter linking to a Washington Post column he penned last year with the
headline ""Trump is a racist president.""

US President Donald Trump's apparent decision to stop using xenophobic language in relation to the Covid-19 pandemic did not come a moment too soon for one Chinese-
American comedian, who said the problem of racism against Asian people in the US was part of the nation's fabric.
Joe Wong, who moved to the US in the 1990s and completed a PhD in biochemistry at Rice University, Texas, in 2000 before moving on to a successful career in stand-up
comedy, said Trump's repeated use of terms like ""Chinese virus"" was fairly typical of the prevailing attitude in the country.
""When I talk about racism against AsAms [Asian-Americans], people's attitude is 'not you too!' Anti-Asian racism is not even acknowledged as a thing,"" he said on Twitter.
""Asian slurs are pretty well received at live comedy shows. It's so exhausting to fight it every time it happens.""
After a rise in the number of reports of physical and verbal attacks on Asian-Americans, Trump spoke out at a coronavirus task force news conference at the White House on
Monday.
""They're amazing people and the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form,"" he said.
Despite the tone of Trump's message, Wong said the language the president used was just another example of the division in American society. ""We Asians are referred to as
'they', and 'they' are not 'us',"" he said.
A study by San Francisco State University recently found a 50 per cent rise in the number of news  articles related to the coronavirus and anti-Asian discrimination  between
February 9 and March 7.
Lead researcher Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian-American studies, said the figures represented ""the tip of the iceberg"" as only the most egregious cases would be likely
to be reported.
He also said that a website written in six Asian languages he helped set up to gather first-hand accounts of racial abuse had received reports of 150 cases since going live
last Thursday.
""Honestly I don't know how can you NOT be angry being an Asian in America now,"" Wong said on Twitter.
""My son grew up in America, I caught a glimpse of how racial slurs and gestures go around at schools and kindergartens. Yes, kindergartens,"" he said. ""What worries me is
the fact that clearly those bullies didn't invent the slurs. They learned them from adults around them.""
Authorities in New York on Tuesday responded to the spike in assaults and harassment by opening a hotline to report hate crimes.
That came after E. Tendayi Achiume, the United Nations  special rapporteur on racism, mentioned Trump by name in an appeal for governments around the world to stamp
out xenophobia in policies and messaging.
""It's dismaying to witness state officials - including the President of the United States - adopting alternative names for the Covid-19 coronavirus,"" she said.
C.N. Le, director of the Asian & Asian-American Studies Certificate programme at the University of Massachusetts, said phrases like ""Chinese virus"" played into deeply
ingrained stereotypes.
""That term plays off of old  racist and xenophobic stereotypes of Asians in general, and Chinese in particular, as filthy, uncivilised, subhuman and, ultimately, inferior to whites
and incompatible with the national American identity,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Wang Yuan, a Chinese student at Northwestern University in Illinois, said she was trying to play her part in fighting Covid-19 by drumming up financial and other
support from the Chinese community.
""To combat the pandemic and Sinophobia, Chinese across the States have devoted themselves to monetary/medical supplies donations for hospitals running short of
protective gear,"" she said. ""[But] this is not only about any specific racial group's self interest. This is about how we should act in solidarity to combat the pan-demic at this

Asian-Americans report rise in hate crimes, fuelled, rights groups say, by President Donald Trump’s own rhetoric
On a normal weekday the streets of Manhattan’s Chinatown are filled with people spilling out from heaving restaurants. But for
weeks now it has resembled a ghost-town.
“We were already down customers after the coronavirus was reported in China,” one restaurant owner told The Telegraph, “but
in March we saw a big drop.”
The loss of business could partly be put down to people deciding to self-isolate at home, he figured, but delivery orders were
down too, which made him suspect there was a more sinister reason.
Asian-Americans have reported a rise in hate crimes and discrimination as the US grapples with the growing health crisis,
fuelled, rights groups say, by President Donald Trump’s own rhetoric.
Mr Trump, who has attempted to shift blame for the outbreak paralysing swathes of the country, onto Beijing, repeatedly calling
Covid-19 the “Chinese virus” and the “foreign virus”.
A close-up of the president's notes on Thursday even showed where the word ""corona"" had been crossed out and replaced with
""Chinese"" in black marker pen.
Mike Pompeo, Secretary of State, meanwhile, has been referring to it as “Wuhan flu”.
John Cornyn, Republican senator for Texas, defended Mr Trump’s use of the term, saying: ""China is to blame because the
culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the
people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses like SARS, like MERS, the Swine Flu.""
A White House official even called the virus the “Kung Flu” during a briefing with China-born American reporter from CBS News.
“Makes me wonder what they’re calling it behind my back,” Weijia Jiang tweeted.

Members of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus warned fellow lawmakers against contributing to ""discriminatory
language"" after a senator suggested that the coronavirus had been created in a laboratory in China.
The World Health Organisation has advised against terms that link the virus to China or the city of Wuhan, where it was first
reported, in order to avoid discrimination or stigmatisation.
Xinhua, China’s official news agency, said Mr Trump’s language was “racist and xenophobic” and revealed “politicians'
irresponsibility and incompetence”, risking increasing fears over the virus.
Videos have been posted on social media of people riding the subway in New York harassing Asian commuters. One can be
heard telling a woman wearing a face mask to “go home and stop infecting people”.
One Korean user joked that “being Asian on public transport was the new Arab”.

“My kids are being called ‘corona’ in school,” tweeted Jordan Matsudaira, former chief economist on Barack Obama’s Presidential
Council of Economic Advisers.
To counteract the #Chinesevirus hashtag trending on Twitter, Asian users have begun using the global hashtag
#JeNeSuisPasUnVirus--French for ""I am not a virus.""
Gun shops around the country have reported a rise in the number of Asian-Americans buying weapons, citing concerns they will
face a backlash.
“People are panicking because they don’t feel secure. They worry about a riot or maybe that people will start to target the
Chinese,” David Liu, a Chinese-American gun dealer outside Los Angeles, told the Trace.
Back in Chinatown, the latest figures show trade is down by as much as 70 per cent, and that was before New York’s governor
issued a mandatory takeout and delivery only order for restaurants starting Tuesday.
Public health experts note that many reasons people cite for avoiding Chinese restaurants are unfounded and are a result of
misinformation: people do not contract the virus through food originating in China.
The US has now recorded more than 8,000 cases across all 50 states, but the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
notes that ""at this time, this virus is not currently spreading in the (Chinese) community in the United States.""
Charissa Cheah, a professor in the Department of Psychology at the University of Maryland, who is looking into the prejudice
public health emergencies such as Covid-19 tend to reveal, told the Telegraph that Asian-American families in communities
across the US have reported seeing a rise in abuse.
Parents tell her children are being ostracised by others and are afraid of openly showing any symptoms of illness for fear of
being further shunned.
While viruses do not discriminate, there are many examples through history of immigrant populations being discriminated
against during outbreaks: Jewish communities were targeted during the bubonic plague in the 1300s, Irish immigrants were
blamed for typhoid in the 1800s, and West Africans for Ebola in 2014.
Ms Cheah said that Mr Trump’s use of language has refuelled historical racist tropes.
“In times of fear, people react in ways that reinforce group identity and stereotypes about ‘The Other'. Asian-Americans have
always been treated as the other, the perpetual foreigner, regardless of how many generations they have been in the US,"" she
said.
“We are trying to educate people in communities with Asian populations that this thinking is wrong. But it’s hard when the
leader of the country is effectively validating this discrimination.”

Until recently, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz’s daily podcast was most famous for one thing: daily musings about the U.S. Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. But in mid-
March, the state’s junior senator waded into a new topic. While reflecting on his self-imposed self-quarantine, he defended the president for the administration’s response to the
novel coronavirus.
Trump, the Texas Republican said, “wasn’t serving bat soup in the Wuhan province,” an apparent nod to a now-debunked myth that the outbreak began after a woman in China
ate bat soup.
His comments are not an anomaly among GOP leaders. In a recent tweet, Trump called the novel coronavirus the “Chinese virus.” U.S. Sen. John Cornyn said he thought “China
is to blame” for the illness “because [of] the culture” there. (Cornyn later said that he meant to say that the Chinese government was to blame, not Chinese people or Chinese
culture.)
Texas now has more than 350 recorded infections and six dead, with a growing rate of increase — unleashing widespread fear and, in some instances, outright xenophobia and
anti-Chinese sentiments among the nation’s leaders.
While health experts are using the term COVID-19 to describe the disease caused by the coronavirus that was discovered late last year, a number of prominent conservatives
have adopted different monikers: the “Chinese virus,” “Wuhan virus” and reportedly even “Kung-Flu.”
Supporters of these terms counter both that the virus first appeared in Wuhan, China, and that other famous diseases are named after the site of the best-known outbreak. But
experts note that this kind of language encourages people to view what’s now a global pandemic in overly simplistic geographic or racial terms.
One Asian American studies expert called the usage of such rhetoric “textbook racist discourse.”
“The renaming will have broader meanings and implications for Asians and Asian Americans in the country and around the globe,” said Yuan Shu, the director of the Asian
Studies Program at Texas Tech University. “This gesture will fuel a new wave of crimes and stigmatizes the entire racial group.
“If the virus has already been named by the [World Health Organization] as COVID-19, any renaming is highly politically charged and motivated.”
The usage of such terms has also had a social cost for East Asians. Some said they were afraid of coughing or wearing face masks in public now, even as a simple precaution.
Eddie Pan, who volunteers at the Dallas Chinese Community Center, said the incidents he hears about reminds him of the discrimination Muslim people faced immediately after
9/11.
Using that language, Pan said, “lowers people’s perception of how widespread this could be. It helps people think, ‘If I’m not Chinese or I’m not Asian, then I can’t catch it.’”
Pan, 39, said he hasn’t personally experienced racism or discrimination in his hometown of Plano, but he said that treating the new coronavirus as a Chinese scourge “fuels
prejudice” and could lead to the denigration of certain populations.
That denigration certainly isn’t unique to this year. When the Ebola outbreak emerged in 2014, Africans were the primary targets of stigmatization. During the SARS outbreak,
East Asians were similarly discriminated against. “Stigma, to be honest, is more dangerous than the virus itself,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the World Health Organization’s
director-general, said recently.
Madeline Hsu, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin, said some people have seemingly tried to avoid her since the virus began to spread. More recently, when
she was at a kickboxing class in Austin, she said she felt self-conscious after another woman, who is white, began talking “extremely loud to a woman next to her about the
coronavirus.”
“Elected leaders using that type of language reinforces this idea that this virus is attached to a particular country or certain persons, which undermines efforts to manage it,”
Hsu said. “This virus is not going to distinguish people on the basis of race or nationality.”

To be sure, some GOP state leaders have taken pains to warn that everyone is vulnerable to the virus. Gov. Greg Abbott, who has consistently referred to it as the coronavirus
or COVID-19, warned Thursday night that tens of thousands of Texans could be infected.
But even as fears over the virus have led to an uptick in reports of harassment and assault of Asian Americans and the decimation of Chinese and Asian American businesses,
other leaders have continued using the terms. (In fact, the epicenter of the pandemic is now Italy, which has surpassed China as the country with the most coronavirus deaths.)
In a now-viral video posted to Twitter by The Hill, Cornyn said China has been “the source of a lot of these viruses” because “people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things
like that.” During a conference call with reporters last week, the state’s senior senator also said that it’s “no coincidence” that illnesses such as the novel coronavirus originate in
China, putting the onus on “some of the cultural practices there.”
Cornyn and other GOP leaders who have drawn pushback appear to be taking a page from Trump’s playbook. According to The Washington Post, a close-up of the president’s
notes show he once crossed out the word “corona” and replaced it with “Chinese” as he spoke with his coronavirus task force. Speaking with the press, he has repeatedly
defended his practice of calling the new coronavirus the “Chinese virus.”
“It’s not racist at all,” Trump told reporters last week when explaining his use of the term. “It comes from China, that’s why.”
Those protestations recall other cases in which Trump has used racist language, such as when he said four American women of color in Congress should “go back” to their
countries or when he suggested a federal judge was biased against him because the judge is Mexican. (The federal judge was born in Indiana and is of Mexican American
descent.)
That the coronavirus has spread beyond China’s border hasn’t diminished the spate of prejudice against the country, however. Nationally, foot traffic in Chinatowns has taken a
nosedive, with some restaurants reporting losses of up to 80% of their business. To support these restaurants, some Texas officials have held public meetings and lunches at
local Asian establishments to help quell public fears.
Before Abbott ordered the closure of bars and restaurants statewide, state Rep. Gene Wu, D-Houston, was encouraging his Twitter followers to visit local Asian grocers or
restaurants in his or a neighboring state House district. “A lot of the Asian restaurants, not just Chinese, but Korean and Vietnamese restaurants, have been hit pretty hard,” he
said. “If they go down, so will all the people who work for them.”
Wu was one of several officials who laced into Cornyn for his remarks about China, later describing the senator’s comments as “purely political.”
“There are actual real-world consequences when people use this kind of language,” Wu said, noting a recent case at a Midland Sam’s Club where a 19-year-old attacked an
Asian American family.
The response to the virus has been similar globally. According to The New York Times, at a tourist hotspot in Vietnam, owners placed a makeshift sign outside their restaurant
reading, “We can’t service for Chinese, SORRY.” Other places have refused to serve Chinese guests.
Lang Nguyen, who lives in Irving, said when he tried to vote ahead of the March elections, he started coughing after choking on some water. A woman in front of him, he said,
proceeded to scold him before saying, “Well, all you Asian people are spreading the coronavirus, and I don’t want to partake in that mess that y’all started.”
“It’s like they’re mad at a specific country, so they want to point the finger. But what they don’t realize is they’re pointing the finger toward Chinese Americans and Asian
Americans as well,” Nguyen, 34, said of the encounter.
Nguyen, who sheepishly acknowledged that he voted for Trump in 2016, said he plans to reexamine his options ahead of this fall; experts, too, note that Trump’s rhetoric could
alienate a broader coalition of Asian American Republicans.
“Creating an anti-Asian bias is really problematic,” said Frank Fernandez, a senior research fellow with the Asian American Studies Center at the University of Houston and an
assistant professor at the University of Mississippi. “Plus, the Asian American voting-age population is growing in the U.S., and people don’t forget these kinds of things.
“You’re stirring up racial bias, and this doesn’t go away,” Fernandez said.
In Plano, which has a large population of Asian Americans, Pan said he hoped government officials might be more thoughtful with their language in the near future.
“People need hope and positivity more than hatred,” Pan said. “I remember looking out the window on Sunday and just having this surreal feeling. ... It’s like zombie
apocalypse.
“Makes me wonder if we’ll be like this in July, August or even later,” he added. “I’m sure I’m not the only person who feels like this, so let’s focus on the positive things. Not
hatred and racism.”

The US lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic could begin to draw to a close at the end of the 15-day shutdown this coming weekend, President Trump indicated on
Monday, as the cost of the exercise the world is embracing is also decimating the national and global economy.
In all-caps, the US president tweeted: ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION
AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"" He retweeted his own tweet, suggesting that he is aligning with the argument than an indefinite or even a long-drawn lockdown could
hurt the world economy for a long time, causing more damage than the virus.
The tweet is seen as a pointer to what could be a gradual removal of restriction with a range of new protocols in place, unless there is an exponentially dramatic and continued
surge in infections. Health officials are suggesting that the thermometre gun could become even more ubiquitous than the metal detector security wand, and social distancing,
including the end of body contact gestures such as handshakes, could become the norm.
""I will bring it up at the next task force meeting and see whether there's some sort of a logistical, bureaucratic reason why it can't be done. The rationale for doing it is at least
worth serious consideration,"" Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said in an interview to Science magazine about instituting
temperature checks. Already, China and Italy have instituted such checks at most public places, including supermarkets.
While the logistics seem daunting, experts say the technology challenges are fairly easy to overcome; eventually, the same metal detectors at security checkpoints could also be
engineered to measure temperature. The danger though is of freelance vigilantism and stigmatisation that is already surfacing across the world.
Aside from an uptick in xenophobia that has put people of East Asian origin in the crosshairs, even US citizens who are self-reporting cases of Covid-19 are being viewed with
fear and subjected to harassment. An Indian-American mother of two kids in the Greater Washington area who reported her two high-school children testing Covid-19 positive
and alerted her friends to it on social media subsequently deleted her post after the school principal demanded she remove it, ostensibly because it is causing panic in the
school. While many friends lauded her courage in alerting the community, others peppered her with questions about how and where her kids contracted it, how and where they
were tested, symptoms etc. She did not want to be named because of the amount of harassment she is facing.
Meanwhile, the US president latest thinking on easing the lockdown at the end of the 15-day isolation came even as he admitted he was a ""little upset"" with over its late sharing
of information on coronavirus. ""They should have told us about this,"" he told reporters at a Sunday White House briefing. ""I'm a little upset with China. I'll be honest with you,
because as much as I like President Xi (Jinping) and as much as I respect and admire the country.""
US lawmakers, meantime, are struggling to come up with stimulus package, with Democrats blocking it because they say it favours corporations rather than workers. The
situation is also complicated by many lawmakers going into selfisolation. The spouse of Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar has been diagnosed with Covid-19 infection in
addition to two other congressmen and a senator, Kentucky Republican Rand Paul. This is making the passage of legislation tricky. There are now calls from several quarters,
including from President Trump, to consider changing rules to enable remote voting -- yet another possible norm change in the future across the world.

202102,"
It was a bright day in North Bay a week or so ago, just days before the nation ground to a halt. Canadian actor Russell Yuen, 54, was relaxing by picturesque Lake Nipissing
during a break from filming, his sunglasses perched on his nose as he absorbed the icy beauty in front of him.
A white couple walked up and stood nearby. Presently the man spoke. This is Yuen's account of what happened next.
The man said, ""It's so much nicer here than Toronto. We can get away from that Chinese virus.""
Yeun turned to him said, ""Excuse me?""
The man said, ""Oh you know, the virus that Chinese people brought over.""
So Yuen took off his glasses and said, ""Please repeat that again.""
At that, the man turned verbally abusive. ""You f---ing Chinese man, why aren't you wearing a f---ing mask? Get the f--- away from me. You and your f---ing virus, go back to
where you came from.""
Yuen is fourth-generation Canadian. His ancestors literally united Canada - they came here to build the Canadian Pacific Railway, upon which rested British Columbia's decision
to join Confederation in the late 1800s.
He said, ""You mean, Montreal?""
""Don't be a f---ing smartass,"" the man said. ""You know what I'm f---ing talking about.""
""Meanwhile his wife is hiding behind him,"" Yuen said. ""Like I'm the alien creature from ""Alien"" that could spit acid at her and dissolve her or something.""
""I said 'Look, you're entitled to your opinion but you're wrong.'"" And as Yuen walked back to his room, the man kept swearing, saying ""We're going to get out of this place. I
can't believe they're letting those types of people in here.""
This wasn't Yuen's only recent experience with racism since the rise of the COVID-19 pandemic. And bigots being bigots everywhere, he is one of the rising number of people of
East Asian descent being singled out around the world and blamed for the deadly virus.
A few things need unpacking in light of this renewed racism. First, people of East Asian descent need systemic support. Second, it establishes why COVID-19 should never be
called the Chinese virus. Third, the brazen bigotry has blown the facade off the ""model minority"" myth.
The Indian actor Meiyang Chang was out for a jog on the streets of Mumbai recently when two guys sped past him on a bike, ""screaming 'corona' and laughing,"" he told media.
He gets teased by friends, which he told media he didn't mind, but he also gets randomly called ""corona"" on Instagram, which he does.
American writer/journalist Jeff Yang shared his ""first 'breathing while Asian' moment"" on Twitter. An older white woman with a mask turned on him at a grocery store and
shouted ""F--- you.""
""As I stared at her, she pulled off her mask, coughed directly at me, turned on her heel and walked off.""
Other Asian Americans responded with their own experiences on Yang's Twitter feed.
Sinophobia being rampant in the U.S. isn't surprising. That country's president read a speech last week on which, as a Washington Post photographer captured, the word
""corona"" was scratched out and replaced with ""Chinese."" All the better to cover his own ineffectual response that led to the U.S. swiftly becoming the world's third-most affected
country.
It's not racist, Donald Trump insisted. It's just where the virus originated.

202102,"
Amid the coronavirus wreckage, there seems to be a bright spot. The pushback against referring to Covid-19 as the ""China virus"" indicates a welcome new sensitivity for the
racial discrimination directed at Chinese-Americans.
Or does it?
Ever since people began referring to ""the China virus"" -- or to be precise, ever since the White House press corps realized it was Donald Trump's preferred term -- the American
people have been given repeated warnings that this is not only insensitive but dangerous. The subheadline of a recent New York Times story captures the tone: ""As bigots blame
them for the coronavirus and President Trump labels it the 'Chinese virus,' many Chinese-Americans say they are terrified of what could come next.""
The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights has also chimed in with a statement warning public officials against normalizing ""xenophobic animosity toward Asian Americans"" by using
""the China virus."" The Council of Chief Diversity Officers at the University of California instructs the university community not to use terms like ""Chinese virus"" because they
""cast either intentional or unintentional projections of hatred toward Asian communities."" Beijing complains that Mr. Trump's use of such terms contributes to the ""stigmatization
of China.""
It's hard not to notice the chasm between this new hypersensitivity and the indifference toward another, very real discrimination affecting this same community. That is the
racial discrimination keeping Chinese-Americans out of America's most elite educational institutions. Some of the same people who fret so loudly about how we refer to Covid-19
are utterly indifferent to this other racial discrimination affecting Chinese-Americans.
Start with the mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio. After Mr. Trump tweeted out a reference to ""the China virus"" earlier this month, Mr. de Blasio clapped back. Asian-Americans,
the mayor thundered, ""don't need you fueling more bigotry.""
If someone fuels bigotry by calling a virus a name accurately derived from its geographic origins, what about a mayor who works overtime to reduce the number of Asian-
Americans in his city's most competitive public high schools, not because they haven't earned their entry but because they aren't the right race.
Ditto for Harvard. Remember, the chief argument against ""the China virus"" is that using it stigmatizes both China and people of Chinese descent. But what about the stigmas
that come from the subjective ""personal ratings"" Harvard applies in its admissions process? The Justice Department says these ratings produce ""consistently poorer scores for
Asian-Americans,"" a racial penalty that brings down an Asian-American applicant's overall score.
According to Students for Fair Admissions, the group suing Harvard over its use of race in admissions, Asian-Americans as a whole score higher ""on many objective measures
than any other racial/ethnic group including test scores, academic achievement, and extracurricular activities."" But if we are to believe Harvard, Asian-Americans are less
likable, less kind and less courageous than those of other races. If that's not stigmatization, what is?
Or take the World Health Organization, which prides itself on objectivity and professionalism. In 2015, WHO updated its best practices for naming new infectious diseases. The
aim is to prevent a name from ""stigmatizing"" any particular community or country, and thus avoid negative implications for everything from trade and tourism to violence.
Yet WHO refers to the West Bank and Gaza as ""Occupied Palestinian territory."" Anyone ever ask the Israelis if they feel stigmatized or endangered when the world's premier
health authority lends its imprimatur to such a politicized name?
In an attempt to restore some perspective, two members of U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, Gail Heriot and Peter Kirsanow, issued a tart dissent from the majority's claim that
people who say ""the China virus"" are encouraging ""xenophobic animosity."" Ms. Heriot and Mr. Kirsanow turn the tables on their fellow commissioners, pointing out that when
authoritative organizations such as the commission indulge in ""promiscuous"" use of words such as ""racist, xenophobic, and hateful,"" it can also have ugly effects. All too often it
means promoting the false notion that America is a steaming cauldron of hate just waiting to boil over.
Certainly Chinese-Americans (and others of Asian descent mistaken for them) are now enduring disgusting attacks and slurs from those unfairly blaming them for Covid-19.
Much of this is crude name calling, such as the 13-year-old Connecticut girl taunted as ""corona"" by her classmates. Other acts by those blaming Chinese people for coronavirus
are downright criminal, from the stabbing of an Asian-American father and son at a Texas Sam's Club to an assault on a New York man, who was kicked, spat on and told to go
back to China.
As the Commission on Civil Rights rightly says, ""xenophobia wears many faces."" And in a nation of 330 million, America has its share of goons.
What's Harvard's excuse?

Being on the receiving end of racism is not fun. For those of us who have experienced it, we know that it can be enraging and humiliating all at once.
It makes no difference what color or ethnicity the racist is, but this seemingly uncontroversial assertion has long been rejected, dismissed, or ignored by mainstream society and
the liberal media. After all, the Left has taught that racism means prejudice plus power, and only white people, who hold the power in this country, can be racist.
Then the coronavirus outbreak took over daily life. All of a sudden, the media is open to reporting that Chinese Americans, along with other Asians who are mistaken as being of
Chinese descent, are facing racism not just from white people but also racial and ethnic minorities.
On March 7, the New York Times published an op-ed by a young Chinese American woman who encountered racism from a Vietnamese nail technician at a salon. The
technician, making an apparent reference to the origins of the coronavirus at a market in China where exotic animals were slaughtered and sold, said that Chinese people ate
“weird” food and brought it to the United States. “Chinese people, I don’t like you. You are so bad, so bad, and so gross,” the Vietnamese nail technician added.
Upon reading the op-ed, a friend of mine observed, “I’ve seen the menus at Vietnamese restaurants. Vietnamese people have no business accusing anyone else of being
‘gross.’” Yes, many Vietnamese restaurants offer a panoply of entrails and similar items on the menu. Some might call it “weird.”
But food humor aside, those of us who hate identity politics have known for a long time that white people are not the sole source of racism. I have pointed out that some of the
people who harbor the most hostility toward Asians are other Asian people. The story shared by the New York Times op-ed shows just how ugly that racism can be.
At the same time, those dishing out racism toward Asian Americans often include other people of color, such as African Americans.
Asian Americans who are familiar with urban settings know well that racism from other minorities such as African Americans is commonplace. I have even written a book,
Chinese Girl in the Ghetto, talking about precisely the ugliness of such racism and the cravenness with which society and the media often avoid the subject. Shedding light on
these incidents of racism is not an act of racism against the minority groups involved but a public way of bringing accountability to all for behavior that is unacceptable in
modern society.
Of course, leftists who are now acknowledging that the perpetrators of coronavirus-inspired racism against Asian Americans include other people of color find it far easier to
blame the entire phenomenon on President Trump and Republicans. Their logic supposes that because Trump and Republicans have used the term “Chinese virus” to describe
the COVID-19 pandemic, they are fanning racism.
In reality, Trump and various Republicans began using the term to hold the communist Chinese government accountable for unleashing this horrible, infectious disease on the
world and then lying to shirk responsibility. To Republicans, “Chinese” means China. They are not trying to malign their fellow Americans who did nothing wrong.
Certainly, to Asian Americans who are now facing racist attacks and unfairly shouldering the blame for the coronavirus, they do not believe their tormentors see a difference
between “China” and “Chinese.” Understandably, they want their political leaders to use more responsible rhetoric.
Trump has done exactly that. Upon hearing about hate crimes and increased racism directed at Asian Americans due to the pandemic, he tweeted:
Tweet
He reiterated these sentiments at the White House coronavirus briefing on Monday and said:
“It seems that there could be a little bit of nasty language toward the Asian Americans in our country and I don’t like that at all ... so, I just wanted to make that point because
they’re blaming China, and they are making statements to great American citizens that happened to be of Asian heritage, and I’m not gonna let that happen.”
It was, in some ways, a moment of high comedy, because Trump-haters had been feverishly labeling him as the person using “nasty language.” Trump appeared altogether
oblivious to their complaints. After all, the president wholeheartedly says he is the “least racist person” anywhere in the world, no irony intended.
Chinese Americans who have no innate animus toward the president and who might otherwise applaud his policies ranging from strengthening border security to delivering a
booming economy are glad that he has ceased using the term “Chinese virus.”
Yet, Trump haters and the worshipers of identity politics will find every opportunity to label him a racist. After all, their morally bankrupt ideology is based on the premise that
America is a racist country. It is one reason why they have been so enamored and animated by reports of racism (real or imagined) against Asian Americans during the

The FBI warned of an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans fueled by the coronavirus pandemic.
""The FBI assesses hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the United States, due to the spread of coronavirus disease … endangering Asian
American communities,"" an FBI intelligence report said, according to ABC News.
""The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the U.S. public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations,” it continued.
The analysis was compiled by the FBI’s Houston office and distributed to local law enforcement agencies across the country.
The virus, which was first discovered in China, has been referred to as the “Chinese virus” by President Trump rather than the coronavirus or the COVID-19 virus. Critics say
Trump’s phrasing has fueled racism against people of Asian descent.
Trump defended his use of the term “Chinese virus,” arguing it was because the Chinese government was trying to pin the blame on U.S. soldiers.
“They said our soldiers started it. Our soldiers had nothing to do with it,” he told Fox News on Tuesday. “It came from China. I don’t regret it,” he said. “Everyone knows it came
out of China, but I decided we shouldn’t make any more of a big deal out of it. I think I made a big deal, I think people understand it.”
In recent days, Trump has shifted away from using the phrasing and condemned the harassment of Asian Americans, who have reported being blamed for the spread of the
virus.
""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States, and all around the world,"" he tweeted. ""They are amazing people, and the
spreading of the Virus is NOT their fault in any way, shape, or form.”
The FBI report did not make any reference to Trump or any other U.S. official who has called it the “Chinese virus.”
The analysis said there has been an increase in reports of hate crimes and listed several incidents across the country.
In a March 14 incident in Midland, Texas, ""three Asian American family members, including a 2-year-old and 6-year-old, were stabbed … The suspect indicated that he stabbed
the family because he thought the family was Chinese, and infecting people with the coronavirus,” the FBI report said.

Discrimination against China and Chinese people is nothing new – Sinophobia is a well-documented phenomenon that has
occurred for centuries.
However, the miscellaneous ways it has revealed itself during the coronavirus crisis reveals the increasingly complex relationship
between China and the rest of the world. Sinophobia stems from historical resentment, fears of economic competition and racism.
Fear of all Chinese is also linked to past ethnic trends and, at present, the coronavirus.
In places where Asians constitute a minority such as Europe, the United States, and Australia, Sinophobia seems to be incited by
the profound stereotypes of the Chinese as dirty and uncivilized. Headlines such as “Yellow peril,” Chinese virus “panda-monium”
and
“Chinese kids, stay home” have appeared in French and Australian newspapers. Some Chinese students were also beaten in the
United Kingdom. Meanwhile, some Chinese citizens have not been admitted to hotels and restaurants or shunned by public
transport.
And all the while, the web is dotted with mocking memes about the coronavirus.
The anti-Chinese rhetoric has also gained a sharper and more xenophobic tone in Asia. One common theme has been worries
about 
mainland Chinese overrunning and infecting local populations.
In Singapore and Malaysia, hundreds of thousands have signed petitions demanding a total ban on Chinese nationals entering
their countries; in response, both countries’ governments have implemented some form of entry ban. In Japan, some have
dubbed the Chinese “bio-terrorists,” while conspiracy theories about the Chinese infecting locals, particularly Muslims, have
predominated in Indonesia and elsewhere.
It is crystal clear that the flourishing prosperity of the Chinese has also culminated in ever-increasing numbers of tourists and
students visiting and living in numerous parts of the world, resulting in their increased visibility on the ground. Reports of sporadic

Actress Olivia Cheng was recently volunteering in Vancouver when she says she witnessed a man drive up to an elderly Chinese woman, roll down his window and yell, ""This is
your fault!"" before throwing trash at her.
The incident enraged Cheng, and also served as another reason why she feels it's so important for celebrities of Asian descent to use their voices and speak up against anti-
Asian attacks, which authorities say are increasing during the coronavirus pandemic.
""I don't think we can pretend that this isn't happening,"" Cheng, who stars in ""The Stand"" on CBS All Access, said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ""For now, it
would not be unwise to be a little more careful, to maybe have buddy systems when possible to go get your groceries if you're not feeling safe.""
The FBI reports there has been an uptick in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the outbreak of COVID-19, which first appeared in Wuhan, China, late
last year.
Some people have blamed China and Asians in general for the spread of coronavirus; President Donald Trump at times has called it the ""Chinese virus.""
In New York, state Attorney General Letitia James has set up a hotline to report harassment or other targeted crime. Some of those incidents have been filmed and posted
online.
""Tigertail"" star Tzi Ma says he's been a victim of such harassment. He was entering a grocery store in Pasadena, California, recently when he was confronted by a man in a car.
""He looked at me straight in the eye and said, 'You should be quarantined' and took off,"" said the veteran actor, who was born in Hong Kong but moved to the United States as a
child.
""I got very angry obviously, flush with this kind of cold in your body. And I started screaming at him, but he was way too far away for him to hear me.""
VIDEO: Chinese Canadians warn against a repeat of the racism they faced during SARS
Actor Alain Uy, a star of the upcoming Hulu series ""Marvel's Helstrom,"" worried early on that such incidents would occur after the virus' spread.
""Once this outbreak happened in Wuhan, we all kind of went, 'OK, we know what this is gonna mean,'"" said the actor, who was born in the Philippines.
""Crazy Rich Asians"" director Jon M. Chu said he's been feeling more cautious than usual.
""It's very sad when I feel a little bit weird when I'm going to go for a walk around the block,"" he said,
""The Real"" co-host, Jeannie Mai, who is half-Vietnamese and half-Chinese, revealed recently that for the first time, she needed someone to monitor her social media posts to
delete racist comments.
""The Good Doctor"" actor Will Yun Lee is even nervous about taking his baby son to the grocery store: ""My wife is Caucasian, but my son is half Korean and half white. But he
looks very Asian.""
But Ma and other stars are speaking up and working to combat the ignorance and harassment. Ma joined actress Celia Au and other celebrities and influencers in the recent
campaign called "" Wash the Hate, "" created by IW Group, an Asian American-focused marketing agency. The PSA features Ma, Au and others washing their hands and reminding
people that hygiene, not xenophobia, is the way to help combat the virus.
""If I can start the conversation, why not?' said Au, who was also born in Hong Kong. ""If we don't talk about it, then it's not going to be talked about at all.""
For Cheng, the recent wave of anti-Asian sentiment brought back painful memories of her childhood growing up in Edmonton, Canada, where she was the victim of a bias attack
as a teen.
She went down an internet rabbit hole of attacks posted online. ""I had to stop watching,"" she said. ""It brought up all those feelings again from being a kid and not being able to
do anything.""
Mai says that it's not only important for Asian stars to speak out against these attacks, but people of other races as well.

ASHEVILLE – J Chong had her culinary lesson set. Pesto pasta, made from ingredients she discovered in her
cupboards, would make for a flavorful, accessible meal, one her homebound audience could replicate through their
computer screens.
The Asheville-based Campaign for Southern Equality had invited Chong to lead this free, virtual cooking tutorial for
its The Front Porch series of community webinars. The 42-year-old Chong, who serves on the CSE board, had
already posted a few meal demonstrations on her Instagram during the coronavirus outbreak. Doing another with
CSE seemed like a perfect fit.
""To me, cooking is easy,"" said Chong, an executive sous chef with Katie Button Restaurants. ""But when we're stuck
at home and some are homeschooling and some have kids, cooking can be very stressful. I like to offer some help
to the community.""
Minutes before the lesson began on Zoom, a video conferencing platform, Chong received a brief warning from a
CSE staff member: ""There may be some people who interrupt the class."" Chong didn't give the caution much
concern.
""No biggie,"" she thought. ""If it happens then we will work through it.""

Held in the afternoon of March 27, the lesson started seamlessly. Chong's wife, Danielle, filmed and CSE staff
monitored the Zoom video stream, handling any technical difficulties and booting out any unwelcome guests.
Around 10 attendees signed on to watch Chong turn spinach, parmesan, parsley, dill, and some almonds into a
thick pesto sauce.
About half an hour into the lesson, after Chong tossed the sauce with cooked penne and was preparing to take
audience questions, several new accounts flooded in the video stream.
Chong's first thought: ""Cool, more people are joining.""
Instead, the new entrants began spewing a string of slurs toward Chong. Both verbally and on Zoom's chat feature,
the intruders got off a torrent of anti-Asian and homophobic epithets before CSE staff scrambled to block off all
accounts. While the entire episode lasted around 20 seconds, those listening in said it seemed much longer.
""It felt like forever,"" said Al Murray, CSE's director of engagement and organizational development. ""It was
infuriating. It was heartbreaking. J is an incredible human and just walks through the world with so much kindness.
She is the last person I'd wish this upon.""
Chong, for her part, remained stoic. ""I am a queer Asian, and those words I've heard all my life,"" she said. ""My wife
told me I didn't flinch while it was happening.""
While few words in a xenophobe's vocabulary can shake Chong, one line uttered during her cooking tutorial was
new. Never before had she received the taunt: ""The coronavirus is happening because of you.""
Anti-Asian hate in the time of COVID-19
The intrusion into J Chong's pesto pasta lesson represented two broad trends of the COVID-19 outbreak: disruptive
video chat ""bombings"" and growing incidents - both nationally and locally - of discrimination against Asian-
Americans.
Social distancing, working from home, and remote schooling have bolstered the prevalence of video conferencing
services like Zoom. Yet greater use has been accompanied by an uptick in ""Zoombombings,"" as internet
provocateurs around the world coordinate to barge into personal conversations to stir chaos.
At physical and online events, CSE staff said they're always on alert for any unwanted guests wishing to protest the
organization's pro-LGBTQ messages. Still, the planned interruption of Chong's lesson took the monitors by surprise.
""We didn't have any awareness of it,"" Murray said. ""We have been hosting webinars with open attendance
processes in the past and haven't seen anything like this happen.""
Alongside ""Zoombombings"" many anti-Asian incidents have been reported as some accuse China for the virus's
evolution into a global pandemic.
In late March, UNC Chapel Hill and Duke University released statements denouncing coronavirus-linked racism
against Asians.
Ricky Leung of the advocacy group North Carolina Asian Americans Together said his organization has heard from
Asian North Carolinians fearing discrimination. ""We've been getting inquiries about it pretty much since February,""
Leung said. ""People are just kind of concerned.""'
North Carolina is home to one of the fastest growing Asian American populations in the United States. According to
the U.S. Census Bureau, no other racial or ethnicity group in the state has grown as quickly since 2010. Asian
Americans now make up 3.1% of North Carolina's total population with larger communities in Greensboro,
Charlotte, and Raleigh.

Kyle Navarro was kneeling down to unlock his bicycle when he noticed an older white man staring at him. Navarro, who is Filipino, tried to ignore him, but that soon became
impossible.
The man walked by, looked back and called Navarro a racial slur. He spat in my direction, and kept walking, Navarro said.
Navarro, a school nurse in San Francisco, already had anxiety about racism related to the coronavirus, which emerged in China and has Asian people facing unfounded blame
and attacks as it's spread worldwide. Now, he was outraged.
My first instinct was to yell back at him in anger. But, after taking a breath, I realized that would have put me in danger, Navarro said.
Instead, he took to Twitter last week to turn the ugly moment into an opportunity for a conversation about racism, generating thousands of sympathetic comments.
Asian Americans are using social media to organize and fight back against racially motivated attacks during the pandemic, which the FBI predicts will increase as infections
grow. A string of racist run-ins in the last two weeks has given rise to hashtags - #WashTheHate, #RacismIsAVirus, #IAmNotCOVID19 - and online forums to report incidents.
Critics say President Donald Trump made things worse by calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus.
For a group with a history of being scapegoated - from Japanese Americans detained during World War II to a Chinese American man killed by autoworkers angry about
Japanese competition in the '80s - there's urgency to drown out both bigotry and apathy.
To that end, the California-based groups Chinese for Affirmative Action and the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council set up a hate reporting center last month. New York's
attorney general also launched a hotline.
We kind of just knew from history this was going to snowball, said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. With the rising stress and anxiety, we
knew we'd see a rise in hate incidents.
The center has fielded more than 1,000 reports from across the U.S., ranging from people spitting to throwing bottles from cars. An FBI report distributed to local law
enforcement predicts the attacks will surge and pointed to the stabbing of an Asian American man and his two children at a Sam's Club in Texas last month, ABC News reported.
According to the report, the 19-year-old suspect said he thought they were infecting people. The victims have recovered.
Amid the explosive climate, former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang drew backlash for urging fellow Asian Americans to display more American-ness. In a
Washington Post editorial Wednesday, he called on them to avoid confrontation and do acts of goodwill like volunteering and helping neighbors.
Being 'the good Asian' has not fared well for Asian Americans, Choi said. We don't have to prove our worth and that we belong, that we're exceptional. And we certainly don't
have to believe that this is something that we should ignore.
Yang's spokesman declined to comment.
Meanwhile, Trump has walked back on calling COVID-19 the Chinese virus, saying at a media briefing and on Twitter last week that Asian Americans should not be blamed in
any way, shape or form.
Democrats in the U.S. Senate and House worry the damage has been done and have introduced resolutions to condemn anti-Asian racism.
His followers continue to double-down on that term, said U.S. Rep. Judy Chu of California, chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
Some of the reports received by the advocacy groups describe harassment that appears to parrot Trump, Choi said.
A White House spokesman declined to comment and referred to Trump's remarks at the March 23 briefing.
The president's words also drew some Asian Americans in entertainment and fashion to the #WashTheHate social media campaign last month. Celia Au, star of the Netflix show
Wu Assassins, and others posted videos showing them washing their hands and talking about the effect of racism.
It comes from the top down at the end of the day, Au said. Our top leader is not doing the job, so it's time for us to step up.

Lu Ping does battle for her adopted country armed with a smartphone.
Every day from 6 a.m. to midnight, Lu coordinates donations of masks, medical supplies and money to Chinese Americans Support Hospitals (CASH), a
GoFundMe group she started with friends in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the United States.
The group's mission is to get needed supplies for hospitals in the Washington, D.C., metro area, which includes portions of Maryland and Virginia, and is
known by residents as the DMV.
""This is my home,"" Lu said about why she spends hours on WeChat, the Chinese version of WhatsApp, soliciting donations. ""I must help.""
Her group is not alone. Chinese Americans throughout the United States are mobilizing to provide supplies and equipment to front-line medical professionals,
even as the FBI warns of the likelihood of an increase in hate crimes targeting Asian Americans as the pandemic continues.
""The community itself, just in general, is organized,"" Mai Ngai, a professor of Asian American studies and history at Columbia University, told The New York
Times recently. ""Chinese have all kinds of associations - some based on profession, and some based on the region your family comes from in China,"" she said.
""There's a history of networks, and a history of coming together when there's an issue.""
A graduate of China's Zhejiang University medical school, Lu emigrated from Shanghai to the United States in 1998. The stay-at-home mom represents many,
if not most, of the Chinese Americans who have built lives in new places that have not always been welcoming.
""We cannot be completely separated from China,"" said Wei Wu, minister of the Chinese Christian Church of Germantown, Maryland, who co-founded CASH.
""Whatever happens in China reflects on us, even if this is our home. That's why right now, we feel targeted and insecure because there are people here who
are not happy with China.""
Critics say President Donald Trumpheightened this tension by calling COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus"" last month.

Since COVID-19 emerged in Wuhan, China, late last year, it has swept through 209 countries, sickening 1.3 million people, and killing 75,000 as of Tuesday.
There are more than 368,000 confirmed cases and 10,000 deaths in the United States.
Two California-based groups, Chinese for Affirmative Action and theAsian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, set up a hate crime reporting center in March
and have recorded hundreds of incidents.

In Brooklyn, New York, an Asian woman suffered an apparently race-based acid attack while taking out her garbage on April 5. A few weeks earlier in Texas,
a man targeted and stabbed a Burmese-American man and his two children, ages 2 and 6, at a Sam's Club. He said he had attempted to kill the family
because he believed they were Chinese and infecting people with the coronavirus. One of the children had a laceration wound from his ear across his eye.
These are among the worst examples of thousands of anti-Asian incidents that have been reported since the Covid-19 crisis began. Two weeks after launching
its Coronavirus Anti-AAPI Racism Incident Report platform in mid-March, a coalition of Asian-American groups has received over 1,100 reports of incidents of
coronavirus-related attacks and racial discrimination. Many more cases likely go unreported.
United States President Donald Trump's use of the term Chinese virus may have fanned the flames, but although he has stepped back from using the term
and issued a tweet in support of our Asian-American community, he has not directed a strong governmental response towards protecting Asians and people of
Asian heritage. (Notably, although the US is a party to the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, Trump hasn't
nominated a representative to the treaty's monitoring body.)
Still, federal government agencies can act on their own to address this upsurge in racism. The US Commission on Civil Rights has recently raised concerns
about the new racism and violence. Additionally, the Department of Education has issued guidance to educators, directing them to protect students at risk of
anti-Asian harassment, after a 16-year-old Asian-American boy was attacked by his classmates and hospitalized. And the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) has stated that during Covid-19, protecting civil rights and investigating hate crimes remain a high priority. But the FBI should also set up a task force
to focus on the specific new problems associated with Covid-19 and better coordinate with local and state officials.
Federal agencies that have stayed silent should also work to protect people from Covid-19 related bigotry. Racism against Asian-Americans is real, and it is
dangerous. The US government needs to take it more seriously.

202103,"
Guwahati, April 2 -- The Covid-19 is set to dominate the future debates on globalization, but its impact is not
merely limited to the field of health or international relations. Donald Trump, the President of the United States,
called the Covid-19 as the 'Chinese virus' or 'China virus' on multiple occasions. In his defence, he had pointed out
that the term was not racist at all as the virus was said to have originated in that country. However, he changed his
position and tweeted that the spread of the novel coronavirus in the US was not the fault of the Asian-Americans.
Partly responsible for this change of heart may be the fact that the Asian-Americans have been a target of growing
number of racist and xenophobic attacks related with the virus.
However, closer home, disturbing facts related to an 'old virus' but having mutated to a new form are doing the
rounds in many parts of India now. This pertains to a spike in racist taunts/attacks against the northeasterners with
reference to the novel coronavirus. One would like to call it Racism-19 for the sake of brevity.
There are instances galore of this latest trend which is raising its ugly head. The most infamous being how a
Manipuri girl was spat on and called 'corona' while she stepped out to pick up essentials in North Delhi. Fortunately
in this case, the police acted promptly and arrested the culprit.
In Kolkata, 'Go corona go' chants could be heard in a particular locality. No, this wasn't any community confidence
building exercise to tide over the dark clouds hanging over all of us due to the pandemic, but a mob that had
gathered outside the flat where three women from Nagaland resided. The crowd was adamant that the women ' so-
called 'carriers of the virus' ' should immediately leave their house as well as the locality. When the incidents like
these occur, it is difficult to understand whether the crowd was driven by genuine fear of Covid-19 or outright
racism. As the videos doing the rounds on social media show, the crowd was not maintaining any social distancing,
and hence the possibility of the former appears low.

Hodgepodge Coffeehouse owner Kristle Rodriguez received a text from her employee about the sign: a round plaque glued to the Moreland Avenue building that's home to her
restaurant depicting Winnie the Pooh eating a bat with chopsticks below the words ""Wuhan Plague.""
The signs have been popping up around East Atlanta on a variety of buildings and fixtures. Atlanta Police Department's Homeland Security Unit, which investigates bias-
motivated crimes, has been notified about the signs but so far no arrests have been made.
""It's doing nothing but reinforcing really awful stereotypes,"" said Rodriguez, who posted a photo of the sign on her social media page to mixed reactions. ""I have Asian American
friends that said it's allergy season and they're afraid to sneeze in public because of all of the hate speech.""
Asian Americans have reported increased harassment around the globe since the coronavirus outbreak originated in Wuhan, China. Asians make up 4% of Atlanta's population,
according to U.S. Census data.
For the past week, Atlanta police have received calls about the signs, which appear to be small, bronze-colored plaques that are glued in place. According to three police reports,
the first was seen April 13 on an electrical box in front of 188 Waverly Way in Inman Park. Another was found on April 16 on a city lamp post near the intersection of Wylie and
Flat Shoals in Reynoldstown. A third was found on the Candler Park Market on April 18.
Owners for One Moreland, the building where Hodgepodge is located, turned in a video of the sign to Atlanta police.
Atlanta police spokesman Carlos Campos said the department's Homeland Security Unit has been notified about the plaques, but added they don't appear to meet the criteria
for a bias crime.
""Ifsomeoneweretobeidentified as placing them, any charges would have to be looked at on a case-by-case basis, depending largely on whether any damage was done to the
property to which the medallion is being affixed,""Campos said.
For the plaques to be considered a bias crime, there must be evidence the crime was committed based on the victim's race, religion or sex, or another identifier. Because
Georgia doesn't have a hate crime statute, police would have to confer with the FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office before they could prosecute the case under federal hate crime
laws.
Animator and muralist Rod Ben, 35, of Tucker, said the plaques' overt Asian metaphors invite people to place blame for the coronavirus on those from Asian countries and Asian
American residents.
""No one feels safe,"" said Ben, who is Cambodian and Vietnamese. ""I'm worried for my parents going to the grocery store. Even older people are being harassed and attacked,
and if you're not going to leave old people alone, where is (the harassment) going to stop?""

For the plaques to be considered a bias crime, there must be evidence the crime was committed based on the victim's race, religion or sex, or another identifier.

Activists are encouraging people to post photos of themselves wearing masks on social media to show solidarity with victims who have been attacked in hate crimes.
Congress and activists have cited racist hate crimes against Asian-Americans who were wearing masks to protect them from COVID-19.
The CDC last week reversed course on government guidance about wearing masks during the pandemic by urging Americans to wear them.
""I used to refuse wearing masks when I was younger to avoid being made fun of,"" says Michelle Hanabusa, founder of UPRISERS, a Los Angeles-based clothing brand, which
sells masks emblazoned with the hashtag on her website. The hashtag ""is meant to combat any of these stigmas.""
Activists against COVID-19-related hate crimes are leading a social media campaign using images of people in masks to fight back against attacks on Asian-Americans, which
Congress and the FBI say are increasing.
Last week the Centers for Disease Control asked Americans to wear non-medical masks in public, which the activists see as an opportunity to spread their message that racist
attacks related to the virus must stop. The US surgeon general previously urged Americans not to buy or wear masks. Activists say masks have become a powerful symbol of
the controversy and conflicts involving the virus.
The activists are encouraging people to post photos of themselves in masks with the hashtag #HateIsAVirus to illustrate that wearing masks – and the virus itself – are in no
way specific to any race, region, or nation.
—HATEISAVIRUS (@hateisavirus_) March 29, 2020
Other hashtags, including #WashTheHate, #RacismIsAVirus, #IAmNotCOVID19, have protested hate crimes and hate speech, and condemned President Donald Trump's use of
the phrase ""Chinese virus."" The president said last week that while the CDC is urging people to wear masks, he chooses not to.
Michelle Hanabusa, founder of UPRISERS, a Los Angeles-based clothing brand, sells masks emblazoned with the hashtag on her website. ""I used to refuse wearing masks when
I was younger to avoid being made fun of,"" she says. The hashtag ""is meant to combat any of these stigmas.""
Indeed, it appears that the mask has become something of a symbol.
""From the data available in public reporting, as well as ongoing studies and online conversation that we've been aggregating on racismiscontagious.com, it is clear that the mask
has been a polarizing object,"" says Selina Guo, a New York advertising director at the firm ADMERASIA, which runs the website in collaboration with several non-profits. Masks
were the top target sparking attacks after race and ethnicity, according to data on the site. ""We are anxious to see if this announcement ultimately flattens or exacerbates these
instances.""
Racist attacks on the rise
Last week the FBI warned law enforcement across the country that hate crimes against Asians may increase due to the virus, according to a bureau report obtained by ABC
News, ""The FBI makes this assessment based on the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate COVID-19 with China and Asian American populations,"" ABC
quoted the report as saying.
Two-dozen federal lawmakers from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), wrote a letter urging Congress ""to help us prevent hysteria, ignorant attacks, and
racist assaults that have been fueled by misinformation pertaining to the 2019 novel coronavirus."" The letter cited an attack in February, on an Asian woman wearing a
protective mask who was kicked and punched in a New York subway station.
Racist attacks on Asian-Americans have surged to about 100 per day, according to Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California, leader of the caucus, who said on MSNBC last week
that some victims were ""assaulted just for wearing a face mask.""
Organizers of the social media campaign aimed at stopping the attacks say the recent news events related to masks and attacks are a chance to communicate their cause.

Don't look now, but Donald Trump is dangerously stoking the fires of bigotry and ethnic intimidation during a crisis, while elected Republicans responsible for upholding our laws
and promoting public safety are silent.
For days in March, while COVID-19 raged, Trump eagerly fueled anti-Asian sentiment by calling it ""the Chinese virus,"" even as the FBI warned the country that hate crimes
against Asian Americans were likely to ""surge"" because of stereotypes about the virus.
Rather than stop there, Trump took his bigotry to the airwaves in April and ran a sleazy ad against former vice president Joe Biden. The ad tries to attack Biden by splicing clips
to falsely suggest that the former governor of Washington, who is Asian American and a colleague of Biden's, was really an official of the Chinese government.
All of this has unfolded against a backdrop of hundreds of reports from around the country of rising harassment and hate crimes: increased attacks against members of the
Asian/Asian American/Pacific Islander (AAPI) community.
Such acts have even included physical assaults in New York and Texas, where an Asian American family, including two young children, were stabbed by a man who said he acted
because he thought the family was spreading the coronavirus.
Ohio is not immune. In our state, we are proudly home to 350,000 AAPI residents. According to an open letter condemning coronavirus-fueled racism that was organized by the
Ohio Progressive Asian Women's Leadership and signed by over 100 Ohio organizations, children across Ohio have recently experienced increased bullying based on their AAPI
heritage.
Tragically, we know from examples like that involving Emilie Olsen – a 13-year-old Chinese American girl from Fairfield who committed suicide in 2014 after being bullied in part
based on her heritage – that such harassment can have deadly consequences.
Hamilton County is also not immune. According to the FBI, of all major cities in Ohio, Cincinnati recently had the highest per capita rate of reported hate crimes, with 30
incidents in 2018 alone. Given that hate crimes are notoriously underreported, it is almost certain that more are occurring.
I know from my experience prosecuting hate crimes when I was a federal prosecutor, that Hamilton County has seen its fair share of them. Sadly, we have also looked the other
way, such as when a Cincinnati jury acquitted an attacker for the tragic beating and murder of Vincent Chin in an infamous anti-AAPI hate crime from the 1980s.
With the recent rise in hate crimes and harassment, it is painfully clear that we must do more to strengthen our hate crime protections. Specifically:
We must call on Ohio lawmakers to change our ethnic intimidation law, so committing a hate crime is an automatic felony offense.
We should also expand Ohio's hate crime law to cover sexual orientation, gender identity, and those with disabilities.
We should tap special prosecutors trained in hate crimes to handle these cases through a Civil Rights Division at the Hamilton County Prosecutor's Office, which I have
previously called for creating.
Finally, we should elect a prosecutor who will not be silent in the face of these kinds of attacks, or Trump's inciteful behavior – not during this crisis, and not ever.
We need a prosecutor who will call out the dangerous rhetoric, because words matter and can lead to violence.
We need a prosecutor who will build bridges with members of our AAPI, African American, and Latinx communities, and all communities that are vulnerable to bias crimes.
We need a prosecutor who will learn from other elected prosecutors and set up innovative mechanisms such as hate crime hotlines.
Finally, we need a prosecutor who will actively encourage victims of potential hate crimes to tell law enforcement, because the law cannot address what it does not know.
We do not currently have such a leader in the prosecutor's office, which is why I'm running, and asking for your support. We must meet hate and fear with action, and we must
do it together. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr., ""Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.""
We are all in this together.
Gabe Davis is seeking the Democratic nomination for Hamilton County prosecutor in the Ohio Primary Election.

I'm an American. I'm Korean. I'm your neighbor. I've grown up here just like you have, so why is it that people still
stare at me like I'm an infected carrier?
What do the coronavirus and most Americans have in common? Neither one can tell the difference between Korean
and Chinese people. To the virus, everyone looks the same. To the average American we Asians ""all look the same,""
too. Why does it matter? Because, like contracting the coronavirus, simply looking Chinese can get me hurt or
killed.
I am an Asian-American teenager living in Palisades Park, New Jersey. I do not cough on vegetables. I do not eat
bats or Pangolins. I did not go to Florida to party on the beach during Spring Break. I maintain the proper social
distance and isolate myself as required. But, I also eat fast food like my peers. I love to run. I like playing League
of Legends and the typical stuff any American teenager loves. You can't tell all that just by looking at me –
especially if you're silently blaming me for the virus outbreak because you think I'm Chinese.
Yes, China is responsible. But does that mean that all Chinese people are inherently bad, and that all of them are
individually responsible for the actions of people who share the same race as them? No.
That's just like saying that all Americans are murderers just because an American committed a murder. There is no
reason for people to see all Asians as virus-carriers, and yet, they do.

The coronavirus pandemic has already shown that times of crisis bring out the best in our fellow citizens. We experience it every day as we marvel at the heroic actions of first-
responders, health care professionals, charities and community volunteers. Sadly, however, crises can also bring out the worst. That is why we need to remain vigilant in the
fight against hate, conspiracies and scapegoating. Law enforcement, civil rights organizations and media outlets are reporting on increased hate crimes against Asian-
Americans, due to the completely mistaken and wrongheaded belief that they have culpability for the pandemic.
While it's clear the Chinese government covered up key information about the coronavirus' initial outbreak in Wuhan, we need to remember that it is the people of China who
were the first victims of this policy. Now Asian-Americans of all backgrounds are becoming the targets of harassment, insults and violence.
A man in Texas faces attempted murder charges for attacking an Asian-American family of four in a supermarket and stabbing three of them, including a two-year-old and a six-
year-old child, claiming they were responsible for spreading coronavirus.
The website Stop AAPI Hate has fielded over 1,500 recent hate incident reports including 11 in New York City. Such scapegoating is particularly outrageous when one considers
that 17% of doctors and 10% of nurses in our country εεε those putting their lives on the line to help pro tect our families and neighbors εεεare Asian-American.
Jews are all too familiar with disease-related scapegoating throughout history.
During the Black Plague in Europe in the Middle Ages, Jewish people were scapegoated and killed mercilessly by fanatics across the continent. Over 600 entire Jewish
communities were destroyed. Many killers claimed that Jews had poisoned wells to spread the plague, or that the plague was a Jewish plot to decimate Christian communities.
Never mind that Jews died in horrific numbers during the plague as well. Sadly, modern anti-Semites are right now on the internet weaving similarly insane conspiracy theories
blaming Jews for spreading coronavirus.
Indeed, the Simon Wiesenthal Center just turned over a list of some 45 channels on social media platforms like Telegram and Gab to United States Attorney General William
Barr and Homeland Security that promote lurid conspiracy theories linking Jews to the pandemic and urging those suffering from CoronaVirus to go to synagogues and mosques
to spread the deadly virus.
None of us is immune from accidentally falling prey to misinformation that can hurt our neighbors. One of us εεε Councilman Joshi εεε posted a thoughtless tweet that
potentially could have hurt my Jewish neighbors. As an Indo-American I should have known better. I apologized and toured the nearby Jewish community and learned first-hand
of their commitment and struggle to help fight the pandemic.
Working together with all people of good faith we will hopefully soon be beneficiaries of a vaccine to stop the pandemic. But no one has yet come up with a cure for history's
oldest virus εεε hate.
We all must reject any and all efforts seeking to conflate justified anger at the Chinese communist government with anger towards Asian-Americans. This is the height of
hypocrisy, and insulting to the many Chinese-Americans who fled to our country specifically to escape repression by the Chinese government. We should never blame
immigrants from any country for the actions of a foreign government that they have no control over.
What can we do to fight hate and protect our neighbors? First, be sure to report any incidents to the proper authorities. Please also submit anti-Asian American incidents in New
Jersey to the office of Councilman Sam Joshi and to national Stop AAPI Hate website. If you experience an anti-Semitic incident or see anti-Semitic remarks on social media
please contact ireport@wiesenthal.com.
Also, continue to check in on your neighbors εεε regardless of their background. The pandemic has taught us that we are all in the same boat. Let's be sure we don't allow the
bigots to exploit this crisis. By showing we care about each other, we can emerge from the pandemic stronger and more united than ever.

A March 21 attack on a Chinese American man jogging along a Naperville trail has left the Asian community there uneasy, says resident
Nancy Chen.
The women spit on and threw sticks at the man and told him ""to go back to China,"" Chen said.
""It just does not reflect the kind of Naperville that I have been calling home for almost now 50 years,"" she said.
A Naperville Crime Stoppers poster shows two unidentified women who are wanted for questioning and offers a $1,000 reward for
information leading to an arrest. Naperville police are investigating.
Chen, an advisory board member of United Chinese Americans Illinois Chapter, is urging the Naperville City Council to adopt a resolution
condemning racism and supporting Asian Americans.
Viral racism: Since March 19, the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council’s STOP AAPI HATE reporting center has received more than 1,100
reports nationwide of coronavirus-related discrimination against Asian Americans.
A majority of incidents occurred in grocery stores, pharmacies and big box retail stores, the center reports.
Chen said there’s been a rise in anti-Asian sentiment and hate crimes in the wake of President Donald Trump and other politicians labeling
COVID-19 a ""Chinese virus.""

E-learning access gaps: Suburban educators are realizing gaps in student access to e-learning due to technological challenges affecting low-
income and minority families.
At Elgin Area School District U-46, officials are seeing a significant drop in participation among Hispanic and African American students.
Attendance rates post-COVID-19 lockdown declined during the first week of distance learning — from 95% to 90% among Asians, from 94%
to 89% among whites, from 92% to 76% among Hispanics, and from 90% to 66% among blacks.

Naperville working toward broad steps to address race, inclusion The city of Naperville is considering several action steps to address race-related concerns, which recently have
included comments offensive to Asian Americans and a battery that remains under investigation.
City council members, during a virtual meeting Tuesday, thanked two Chinese leaders for stepping up to condemn a series of remarks that were read into the record during a
meeting April 7 and an attack reported March 21.
Nancy Chen and Bill Liu both asked the council to denounce these and other actions that they say have unfairly stereotyped and singled out Asian American people, especially in
light of the coronavirus pandemic.
Chen called on the city to adopt a resolution to end racism and hate crimes. The suggested resolution she read aloud drew support from several council members.
But City Manager Doug Krieger said, instead of adopting a resolution or proclamation, the city plans to roll out a broader diversity and inclusion plan that has been in the works
for several months.
Work toward the plan began after two high-profile episodes of unrest last fall, one involving a multiracial group of 18 asked to move at Buffalo Wild Wings because staffers said
two white customers did not want to sit by them, and another involving a 14-year-old white student who posted an ad online showing a photo of a black classmate with the
words ""Slave for Sale (NAPERVILLE).""
The city in December updated its mission statement to include a focus on ""creating an inclusive community that values diversity."" Krieger said a future diversity plan will include
recommendations related to the staff members and partner organizations, taking into account feedback received from the U.S. Department of Justice. The plan is expected to
come before the council May 19.
The plan could help address concerns raised by Chen and Liu, who said some recent actions have served to divide the city.
Chen said a Chinese American man jogging on a trail March 21 ""was physically attacked by two women who spit on him and yelled at him to go back to China.""
Naperville Crime Stoppers is offering a reward of up to $1,000 for information that leads to an arrest in the case. Police are investigating.
A few weeks later, comments submitted by Erika DeCarlo during the city’s first virtual council meeting called Asian members of an Opt Out group advocating against recreational
marijuana sales ""roving carpetbaggers"" and made remarks Chen and Liu said they found hurtful.
""I cannot disagree more with Ms. DeCarlo’s depiction of many Naperville citizens of Chinese descent who support the Opt Out as carpetbaggers,"" Liu said. ""The portrayal was
demeaning and highly offensive.""
Council members echoed Chen’s and Liu’s denouncement of the remarks, with everyone on the panel saying there is no place in Naperville and no place in public discourse for
such statements.
Council member Benny White said he is meeting with Krieger later this week to discuss steps toward a potential commission or other framework to address race-related issues.
He also has been hosting a series of Naperville Neighbors United meetings to promote dialogue around race and inclusion.

With public gatherings banned, an Aurora event aimed at inspiring young Latinas earlier this month went virtual — drawing its largest audience in four years.
Aurora’s annual Young Latina Day attracted 30,000 people and garnered nearly 13,000 Facebook views in six hours from 13 countries. Fifty Latina speakers shared their stories
to help empower the next generation of Hispanic girls and women and celebrate their achievements.
""It was historic,"" said Jacqueline Camacho-Ruiz of North Aurora, creator of the nonprofit Fig Factor Foundation, which launched the event in 2017. ""We are trying to make this
day recognized globally by the United Nations in 2021. It’s a big aspirational goal.""
The foundation’s mission is to provide educational leadership platforms, mentorship and empowering activities to Latinas ages 12 to 25. Some of its initiatives have shifted to
the virtual realm, including a self-care Zoom video conference on Sundays for its 157 graduates, board members and mentors.
""We are also getting some grants so we can provide them financial support during this difficult time,"" Camacho-Ruiz said.
Addressing bullying Naperville Unit District 203 is working on addressing cyberbullying after anecdotal reports of incidents targeting Asian American students, school board
member Janet Yang said.
Yang said her 10-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, as well as Chinese American community members, have reported students calling the COVID-19 pandemic a ""Chinese
virus"" before schools closed due to the stay-at-home order.
With students spending more time online, Yang is concerned about such harassment shifting to those platforms. District 203 teachers have been emphasizing ""how to be a good
online citizen"" as part of the social-emotional learning curriculum, she added.
Naperville has a high Asian American population — 18 percent — including people of Chinese and Korean descent and from other East Asian countries.
""This is a good chance to reflect on what true diversity and inclusion means ... to have our students truly understand what it means to have someone who looks different and
have that sense of empathy for them,"" Yang said.
Naperville race relations Naperville city leaders could create a commission to improve race relations after reports of recent racist attacks against Asian Americans.
Resident Nancy Chen introduced a resolution before the council Wednesday urging leaders to establish such a commission. It was motivated by the reported March 21 attack of
a 60-year-old Chinese American man jogging on a Naperville trail and offensive remarks made by a speaker during the April 7 virtual council meeting.
Bill Liu, chairman of Chinese community outreach appointed by the late Mayor George Pradel, also asked the council to denounce actions that unfairly stereotype and single out
Asian Americans. ""Derogatory and insulting comments should not be part of the public discourse,"" Liu said.
City Manager Doug Krieger said officials plan to roll out a broader diversity and inclusion plan in the works since two high-profile incidents last fall — a multiracial group of 18
was asked to move at Buffalo Wild Wings because two white customers did not want to sit nearby and a 14-year-old white student posted an ad online showing a photo of a
black classmate with the words ""Slave for Sale (NAPERVILLE).""
""We want this to be broader than simply just a proclamation,"" Krieger said.
He expects to present the plan before the city council in May.
Ramadan food baskets While suburban mosques are closed, many are finding ways to help community members in need during the COVID-19 lockdown.
The Mecca Center in Willowbrook will be cooking food in its communal kitchen for pickup twice weekly during the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, which began Friday. For
information about pickup times visit meccacenter.org.
The center’s Faith in Action initiative also will be delivering food baskets during Ramadan to community members irrespective of faith, said Imam Hassan Aly.

CHESAPEAKE - The owner of a restaurant in Chesapeake says her car was recently vandalized with anti-Chinese graffiti, an attack that apparently fit a national trend of hate
attacks during the coronavirus pandemic.
And now customers are stepping up to show their support for the business.
Linda Lin Cheng has owned Taste of China for the last 20 years. The small restaurant is tucked away in a shopping center off Battlefield Boulevard. Cheng and her husband run
the place by themselves.
On Sunday, Cheng told a longtime customer, Barbara Sgueglia, someone came in the day before and threw water on them. Sgueglia also said Cheng told her someone painted
""go back to China"" on her car. Cheng confirmed to a Virginian-Pilot reporter that happened to her car but couldn't speak further Monday as her restaurant was too busy.
People have also come into the restaurant screaming words similar to what was painted on her car.
Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, which originated in China, reports like this have been increasing across the United States. The nonprofit Stop AAPI Hate has received
1,500 reports of coronavirus discrimination against Asian Americans since it established a reporting center on March 19. The reports include verbal harassment, shunning and
assault.
After talking with Cheng on Sunday, Sgueglia posted about the conversation on Facebook and floated the idea of helping the business out to show the community's support. The
post garnered hundreds of shares and comments. A Facebook event for a tailgate to order food, and write cards and supportive messages in chalk outside the restaurant
attracted hundreds more.
""My heart breaks for them,"" one commenter wrote. ""We are all in this together and no one should be treated like this. I'm all in on supporting this family and their business.""
A Chesapeake police spokesman, officer Leo Kosinski, said his department was made aware of the original post about the vandalism and harassment and sent an officer to Taste
of China on Monday, but the owner didn't have time to talk. As of 3 p.m., an official report was not yet filed.
By lunchtime Monday, the restaurant was slammed with takeout orders and Cheng and her husband were too busy to answer the phone. Chesapeake resident Elizabeth Higgins
heard what happened to the restaurant and decided she wanted to support it. Her son is a sous chef in Pennsylvania and she's heard of Chinese restaurants there seeing big
declines in business during the coronavirus. As the orders kept coming in Monday, Higgins said she waited for more than an hour for her order of chicken chow mein and orange
chicken.
""Right now, it's best to support the local businesses,"" she said.
Sgueglia is encouraging people to ""spread the love"" throughout the week, as she doesn't want to overwhelm the restaurant. She plans to be out for the tailgate Monday from 6
to 8 p.m. with some music and chairs. She had plans to gather money in red envelopes to give to Cheng and her husband.
Sgueglia, who owns a real estate and property management firm in Chesapeake, got to know Cheng over the years. Sgueglia hosts exchange students who attend private
schools around Hampton Roads and the students are picked up and dropped off in the parking lot where Taste of China is located. They would sometimes pop into the restaurant
when they waited for Sgueglia to come take them home. She described Cheng and her husband as hard workers who never take vacations and are trying to put their son
through college.
She said it's important to surround people and help them out when they go through harassment like this.
""It's so easy to just say people are ignorant. But you don't get a pass,"" Sgueglia said. ""You don't get a pass and get to be ignorant and hateful and hurt other people because
you believe somebody else did something. But I think the solution is that when we see these kinds of things happen to people, we wrap them up in love. We lift them up and we
come together and we just help them and we love them through it.""

The Others. Them.
The very words sound sinister. No wonder they became the titles of horror movies.
But they're what we focus on, in a time of fear. Prejudice could be the one thing that spreads more easily than COVID-19.
""In an epidemic, a lot of feelings get very primitive,"" said psychologist and psychoanalyst Spyros D. Orfanos. ""People get very fearful and xenophobic. They need to externalize
the blame. They need to find somebody who is at fault for this.""
Groups that can be ""blamed"" for the epidemic — Asians in particular — have been reporting an uptick of bias incidents in the last two months. Groups that have been associated
with a particular outbreak, such as Orthodox Jews, have reported the same.
Even the best of us — as we heroically come together to fight a common enemy — are liable to regard our fellow beings with just a wee bit of suspicion.
We worry about The Other — the neighbor we cross the street to avoid, the person in the store we back away from.
And we worry, especially, about people seen as apart from the community — the ones whose ways are unfamiliar, and whose motives are suspect. Them.
""I think in general people are either consciously or unconsciously biased towards other races,"" said Orfanos, director of New York University's postdoctoral program in
psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. ""And whenever something unexpected or fearful happens, a threat that is unprecedented, it interferes with our thinking.""
Unlike the Others of ""The Others"" (2001) — ghosts — and the Them of ""Them!"" (1954) — giant ants — our other-ing of others right now has a superficial basis in truth.
There is, in fact, a disease called COVID-19 that some of us are carrying.
It did originate in a particular country — as all diseases do — though that's pretty much academic, since it's now worldwide. And there have been cases of localized outbreaks
connected with some particular groups (and many other outbreaks not connected with them).
But it's telling that the bias incidents tend to be aimed mostly at populations that are already stigmatized. Asians and Jews, in particular.
There's been an incident
Incidents ranging from verbal harassment (67.3%) to physical assault (10%) to being coughed and spat on (2.7%) to being banned from public transportation (1.0%) have
been reported by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, which on April 3 cited over 1,100 reported incidents of anti-Asian bias nationally, clocked over a two-week period.
One such incident was recounted in a Los Angeles Times editorial: ""A white man on open sidewalk approached and stepped directly in front of me and coughed in extremely
exaggerated manner in my face — loudly, mouth wide open, about 2 feet from my face, said 'take my virus.'""
There are other such reports. The Asian woman who was punched on West 34th Street by another woman who made anti-Asian slurs (March 10). The man in the New York
subway who sprayed air freshener at an Asian passenger (Feb. 6). The Asian student attacked in London by four men who told him, ""We don't want your coronavirus in our
country"" (Feb. 24).
Members of the Orthodox Jewish community also started to worry, when an outbreak originating in a New Rochelle synagogue led in March to a ""containment area"" around the
town.
""We're seeing stuff online,"" Evan Bernstein, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League's Northeast Division, told the The Journal News and lohud.com on March 4. ""We're
getting more and more reports of those comments.""
In Lakewood, tensions have flared between Orthodox Jews — there have been a few cases of weddings held, in violation of rules banning large gatherings — and the rest of the
community. A local petition to shut Lakewood down was condemned by Gov. Phil Murphy.
""Scapegoating, bullying, or vilification of any community is completely unacceptable — today or ever,"" Murphy tweeted. ""There is a special place in hell for the small minority
that do this during this crisis.""

The coronavirus pandemic has already shown that times of crisis bring out the best in our fellow citizens. We experience it every day as we marvel at the heroic actions of first-
responders, health care professionals, charities and community volunteers. Sadly, however, crises can also bring out the worst. That is why we need to remain vigilant in the
fight against hate, conspiracies and scapegoating. Law enforcement, civil rights organizations and media outlets are reporting on increased hate crimes against Asian-
Americans, due to the completely mistaken and wrongheaded belief that they have culpability for the pandemic.
While it's clear the Chinese government covered up key information about the coronavirus' initial outbreak in Wuhan, we need to remember that it is the people of China who
were the first victims of this policy. Now Asian-Americans of all backgrounds are becoming the targets of harassment, insults and violence.
A man in Texas faces attempted murder charges for attacking an Asian-American family of four in a supermarket and stabbing three of them, including a two-year-old and a six-
year-old child, claiming they were responsible for spreading coronavirus.
The website Stop AAPI Hate has fielded over 1,500 recent hate incident reports including 11 in New York City. Such scapegoating is particularly outrageous when one considers

Pakistan, April 12 -- Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, another concomitant pandemic named as xenophobia has also enveloped whole
the world. As per reported incidents so far, xenophobia, more specifically sinophobia, is surging at an exponential rate across the
globe. Stigmatization of Chinese people in wake of outbreak of coronavirus has become new normal in the world. People now look at
Chinese with humongous disdain and contempt for they consider them as sole responsible for all the physical and mental afflictions
that they are undergoing nowadays due to the COVID-19 which showed its first appearance in Chinese city of Wuhan.
Moreover, this discrimination and antipathy is not only restricted to the Chinese people but people of East Asian and south Asian
descent having appearance and facial resemblance with Chinese are also facing xenophobia, prejudice, racial apartheid and violence.
Admittedly, disease inculcates fear in human minds which in turn fosters discrimination. This had been happening in the history
whenever there was outbreak of any pandemic. The chronological account of the world shows that during 1853, yellow-fever epidemic
in the United States and European immigrants, who were perceived to be more vulnerable to the disease, were primary targets of
stigmatization. During the SARS outbreak, which originated in China, East Asian bore the brunt. When the Ebola outbreak emerged in
2014, Africans were targeted. For this reason, the World Health Organization, which is keenly overseeing the global response to the
coronavirus outbreak, opted against denoting a geographic location when officially naming the new virus, as it did with Ebola (named
after the river in Congo, where it was first detected) and the 2012, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome popularly known as MERS.
""Stigma to be honest is more dangerous than virus itself,"" remarked Dr Tedros Adhanom, the director general of the WHO in his press
talk.
However, we find newspapers replete with news pertaining to ballooning xenophobia and racial discrimination in the wake of outbreak
of COVID-19. Surprisingly, even the country where from the virus was originated is not immune to this social epidemic of
stigmatization. According to the world journal, there have been countless instances of Wuhan natives in other provinces being turned
away from hotels, because of their ID numbers, home addresses and telephone numbers deliberately leaked online or dealing with
harassing phone calls from strangers. Some places also reportedly had signs saying ""People from Wuhan and cars from Hubei are not
welcomed here"".
In addition, on March 29, British daily The Guardian reported that Western and African expatriates in China were reporting enhanced
racial hostility and discrimination in response to a shift of COVID-19 cases from local to imported ones. It claims that media in China
have published articles entitled as ""Beware of a second outbreak started by foreign garbage"", and incidents of foreigners being barred
from restaurants, shops, gyms and hotels, subjected to further screening, and verbal attacks and exclusion are mounting in china day
in day out.

202103,"
Pakistan, April 15 -- The coronavirus pandemic has Americans across the country fearful for their personal health and well-being, but for Asian Americans, the virus has stirred
up another threat: a wave of verbal and physical attacks.
In the most egregious hate crime thus far, an Asian American family, including a two-year-old girl, was stabbed at a Sam's Club Store in Midland, Texas. The attacker admitted
to police that he tried to kill them because he believed they were Chinese people infecting Americans with the coronavirus.
Another victim Julie Kang, 30, said she was first verbally assaulted in December, when coronavirus cases were just beginning to surface in China. A man walked up to her in the
middle of downtown San Diego, got in her face, and called her racial slurs. It took a moment for her to register what happened, she said, and she tried to shrug it off.
Joe Biden, the apparent Democratic presidential nominee, has publicly condemned the rising violence and number of attacks directed at the Asian American community related
to the COVID-19 pandemic.
In his statement, Biden brought up several recent instances of violence toward Asian Americans. One woman, Yuanyuan Zhu, was spit on last month on her way to the gym as
the perpetrator shouted a China-related expletive at her. In a separate incident, an Asian woman was doused with a substance outside her home in Brooklyn, New York,
resulting in chemical burns to her face and body.
""These disgusting and racist acts must stop. They are grounded in an impulse that is as ugly as it is dangerously ignorant,"" Biden said.
It doesn't help that President Donald Trump and the GOP have been calling Covid-19 the ""Chinese virus,"" putting a target on East Asian Americans. It fits into his
administration's pattern of xenophobia (referring to Mexicans as ""rapists,"" and labeling some places ""shithole countries""), which also fits into his pattern of deflecting blame -
this time as criticism mounts against the government's handling of the coronavirus crisis.
After a week of this rhetoric, Trump tweeted that ""it was very important we protect our Asian American community"" (before othering Asian Americans - ""they"" and ""us"" - one
tweet later) on Monday, but the damage has already been done.
The ""Chinese virus"" rhetoric coming from the White House has real-world consequences for Chinese-Americans (and relationships with China broadly).
As coronavirus has spread across the U.S., so have reports of violence against people of Asian descent, and the FBI warns a surge in hate crimes could be yet to come.
Let us be clear. COVID-19 is not a ""foreign virus."" It is not a ""Chinese virus."" It is not the ""Wuhan virus."" It is a human virus that does not discriminate based on ethnic
background or race.

""We've heard or seen it all ... experiencing looks, stares.""
Nu Huynh
executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance
There would be no large, family birthday celebration for Jing Htun's 7-year-old son, thanks to COVID-19 social distancing restrictions. But
she made sure there would be cake.
Htun picked one up from the Hy-Vee bakery on Euclid Avenue on the morning of March 23, her son's birthday. The cake was nothing
elaborate, she said, just enough to put a smile on his face.
She made her way to the checkout line. As Htun waited to make her purchase, a white couple stood behind her. She said as soon as they
saw she was Asian, they fled.
""(They) said, 'Oh gosh, not here,' and went to another line,"" Htun, who is among the Burmese community in Des Moines, said. ""I have
never seen something like that. I've gone to that store so many times.""
Htun is one of the Asian and Pacific Islander community members in Iowa who have witnessed a rise in racism and xenophobia since
COVID-19 emerged in Iowa March 8 after the initial outbreak in China in January. There have been few complaints filed with Iowa officials,
but Htun and others shared their experiences.
As fears of the virus spread, so too have they seeped into local communities, taking the form of microaggressions — such as the one Htun
experienced — against those who are perceived to be from China.
""I don't know how to feel,"" Htun said. ""I just try to ignore it.""
'You can just feel it'
Nu Huynh, executive director of the Iowa Asian Alliance, keeps tabs on potential discrimination tied to COVID-19, a highly contagious
respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.
""There are no reported hate crimes at the level of violent acts (in Iowa),"" Huynh told the Des Moines Register and IowaWatch.

In 2017, 2.6% of Iowa's population was Asian, according to the State Data Center, with Des Moines, Ames and Iowa City having the largest
numbers. That percentage is projected to grow to 4.4% by 2050, the center reported.
Nationally, Huynh pointed to a more heated atmosphere. She cited the recent spike in hate crimes against Asian and Pacific Islander
Americans nationally, President Donald Trump referring to coronavirus as a ""Chinese virus,"" and the stabbing of three members of an
Asian-American family — including two small children — in Texas because the suspect thought they were ""Chinese and infecting people with
the coronavirus,"" according to an FBI intelligence report.
""We've been very fortunate in that sense,"" Huynh said.
The Iowa Civil Rights Commission has had two race discrimination complaints filed by Asians so far this year, said Elizabeth Johnson,
executive director of the commission. There were eight in 2019 and 12 in 2018. Eleven were filed in 2017 with eight in 2016.
Johnson said that under the Iowa Civil Rights Act, any person has 300 days from the last discriminatory incident to file a complaint alleging
discrimination. ""Therefore, it is entirely possible that many claims alleging discrimination related to COVID-19 have not yet been filed,"" she
wrote by email to the Register and IowaWatch.
Johnson said there has not been an increase in complaints overall as most people are focused on meeting basic needs.
The commission's process is confidential, so more details on complaints filed are not available. ""I can tell you that we have fielded inquiries
related to COVID-19 ranging from inquiries about national origin discrimination to inquiries about age discrimination and public
accommodations to general inquiries about employment protections and COVID-19 exposure,"" Johnson said.
However, Huynh says microaggressions, whether passive or explicit, are taking a toll on Iowa's Asian and Pacific Islander community.
""We've heard or seen it all ... experiencing looks, stares. You can just feel it,"" she said.
In many cases, particularly nationally, discrimination against Asian and Pacific Islander communities has been more evident, such as the
Texas stabbing, which the FBI is treating as a hate crime. But in small cities like Des Moines, microaggressions can be hard to decipher and
be underreported.
For instance, Des Moines and Iowa City detectives came across no reports of Asian and Pacific Islander discrimination or hate crimes filed to
police in recent months. Ames police found two reports of coronavirus-fueled harassment in April, both involving drivers yelling
""coronavirus"" out of their cars to Asian and Pacific Islanders driving alongside them.
The Register and IowaWatch reached out to others in Iowa's Asian communities who said they had experienced some form of discrimination
or harassment due to COVID-19. Several declined to speak on the record because they feared further harassment.
""As an Asian American in times like these we wonder, 'Is it because of me?'"" said Hieu Pham of Monsoon Asians and Pacific Islanders in
Solidarity, a Des Moines-based group that assists victims and survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault and human trafficking.
Discrimination faced is sometimes obvious, other times not
For some, the discrimination is blatant.
Xiangheng Li, 19, helps out at his family's restaurant — Hong Kong Chinese Restaurant — in Des Moines' Drake neighborhood.
It was the beginning of March when his mother, Meifang Zheng, came home from work one evening with a story.
A white middle-aged woman walked into the restaurant that evening. The first thing she asked was if Zheng was Chinese.
Zheng said yes. The woman walked out of the restaurant without saying anything.
Li said his mother brushed off the incident; to her, it was nothing new.
""As an immigrant, we have all faced racism in America,"" Li said. ""I think my first reaction was, 'Wow, I can't believe that happened.' But
when you think about it, racism still exists in America. I just hope (my mom) doesn't get attacked physically.
""Fears fuel anger, and sometimes it can really hurt people.""
To keep track of incidents in Iowa, the Asian alliance has created an online form where community members can submit reports of
harassment and discrimination.
""We must take collective action to prevent and stop these hateful acts. We want to know if our AAPI Iowans are experiencing biased
incidents or actions against them due to Coronavirus/COVID-19,"" the organization wrote in a statement.

Maria, who emigrated from the Philippines to the Pikes Peak region a few years ago and now is a naturalized citizen, hadn’t encountered any discrimination in the United States.
Until last month, when the coronavirus pandemic hit.
While shopping in stores, she’s heard comments like, “I’ll buy this even though it’s made in China,” accompanied by a sideways glance her way.
Dirty looks have now become the norm for Maria, a health care worker.
“I feel upset and bad when it happens,” she said, declining to give her last name. “It makes me sad and disappointed.”
In the wake of the coronavirus being detected in Wuhan, China, in December and since spreading worldwide, racial profiling of Asian nationals and Asian-Americans has been
reported nationwide. Incidents of Asians being spit on, harassed, yelled at and physically attacked have been documented. Earlier this month, an Asian-American woman taking
her trash out in Brooklyn had acid thrown on her, leaving chemical burns.
Since launching on March 19, the Stop Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders Hate reporting center has received more than 1,100 firsthand accounts of coronavirus
discrimination, including verbal harassment, shunning and physical assault.
Many of the targets, like Maria, aren’t Chinese but of another descent, such as Japanese, Vietnamese, Korean, Thai or Cambodian.
Some of the 65 families who are members of the Golden Lotus Foundation, a Colorado Springs nonprofit that promotes Asian heritage and advocates for rights, have been
subjected in recent weeks to obscene gestures and racial slurs such as “Go back home!” and “You brought the virus over,” said founder Cynthia Chung Aki.
“Yes, it originated in China, but it is not an Asian issue — it’s everybody’s issue,” she said. “I think we need to settle down and not target minorities, punish anyone or blame
anybody for economic, political or geopolitical crises.”
Members are feeling frustrated, uncomfortable and powerless, Aki said, adding that she’s forming a task force to develop appropriate responses to bigotry.
Some point to President Donald Trump referring to COVID-19 as the “Chinese virus,” as fomenting racial discord.
Trump did not address the criticism but tweeted on March 23, “It is very important that we totally protect our Asian-American community in the United States, and all around
the world.
“They are amazing people, and the spreading of the Virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together!”
Despite that, the president continues to refer to the outbreak as the “Chinese virus,” which Jennifer Ho, professor of ethnic studies at the University of Colorado Boulder and
incoming president of the Association for Asian American Studies, said violates an international policy.
“Four years ago, the World Health Organization said we are no longer going to be naming diseases by location or ethnicity because historically we’ve seen the way it
marginalizes groups,” Ho said. “There have historically been many traditions we no longer adhere to.”
Anti-Asian sentiment is nothing new, Aki said, pointing to the internment of about 120,000 Japanese-Americans in the U.S. during World War II and the 1982 murder of
Chinese-American Vincent Chin, whom autoworkers beat to death in Detroit after mistakenly thinking Chin was Japanese and, therefore, in their minds, responsible for the loss
of American auto industry jobs.
“There is a tendency for minorities to be punished,” she said. “It behooves us to be able to tackle this; people are hurting.”
Aki hopes generations will come together and work to stop history from repeating itself.
Ho fears incidents of violence will escalate to the point of deaths.
“What would prompt that level of hatred of throwing acid in someone’s face and yell 'Chinese virus?' My guess is fear of the unknown and fear turned into anger,” she said.
“People want to find an outlet and a scapegoat.”

Immigration to the US often suffers when the country faces a disaster, whether it is a disaster of war, economy or public health.
The novel coronavirus pandemic has already prompted the Trump administration to close borders and turn away asylum-seekers without sufficient processing. On Monday,
President Donald Trump tweeted that he would suspend immigration to the US.
That statement was later clarified as a plan to temporarily halt giving foreigners permanent residence in the United States, which Trump claims will protect American workers
during the coronavirus pandemic. The order, which is undergoing a legal review, would suspended the process to grant foreigners ""green cards"" for permanent residence, but a
White House official who requested anonymity to discuss the process suggested the timeline for the order could be pushed back.
Critics say the president's announcement is a move to take advantage of the coronavirus crisis to implement a long-sought policy goal ahead of this year's presidential election.
Business groups expressed opposition to Trump's plan on Tuesday, arguing it would only further depress the economy.
Many key details of Trump's planned executive order are still unknown, but crucially, while the order could block many people applying for permanent residence outside the
United States, it is not clear how it would impact people already in the country seeking to become permanent residents. Trump said the order initially would last for 60 days and
could be renewed for the same period or longer, and that a second immigration-focused order was under consideration.
The Washington-based Migration Policy Institute estimates that Trump's green card effort could prevent between 114,000 and 660,000 people securing permanent residence - if
left in place for a year.
Erika Lee is an immigration history professor at the University of Minnesota and the author of ""America for Americans: A History of Xenophobia in the United States."" The
World's Marco Werman spoke with Lee about how the US has responded with changes to immigration policy and increased xenophobia during times of war, economic hardship
and disease throughout history.
Related: For centuries, migrants have been said to pose public health risks. They don't.
Marco Werman: Let's take a historical look at this. Your book, ""America for Americans"" is about the US' long history with xenophobia. You've seen the
intersection of disease or other crises and nativism before in the past century. How does this current administration's response to this pandemic compare to
another public health emergency, whether it's the 1918 flu or the response to the collapse of hygiene in New Orleans after Katrina?
Erika Lee: The 1918 flu pandemic is actually really fascinating to compare it to what's happening today. So first, we have to understand that, of course, during World War I,
immigration was effectively halted due to the war and the end of passenger steamship travel. But even during the flu pandemic, in which the US lost 650,000 lives, the country
didn't try to limit immigration. In fact, we still let in over 110,000 immigrants. And the Bureau of Immigration touted its kind treatment of sick immigrants.
So, take the immigration detention center in New Orleans, for example. There was an outbreak of flu epidemic there. There were 30 immigrants who were sick. But the Bureau
of Immigration published a report in which it touted how it took care of its employees by requiring face masks, it sanitized the facilities, it put into place social distancing or
isolation. And because of that treatment of immigrants, no lives were lost.
Related: Public charge rule has history of 'racial exclusion'
Erika, the stories right now of hate directed at Asians, Asian Americans - we're hearing stories of acid attacks. So personally, what has it's been like for you as
someone whose grandfather arrived in this country during the Chinese Exclusion Act?
You know, I remember hearing stories of my parents insisting that during World War II, into the 1950s and '60s, they still felt the sting, not only of Chinese exclusion, but also
just anti-Asian racism, in general. Obviously, Japanese American incarceration, as well. And their philosophy was, ""We need to show that we're Americans first and Chinese
second."" So for them, there was this sense of sort of ultra assimilation. ""We need to prove that we're loyal. We need to prove that we're patriots. We need to prove that we're
assimilated.""

Vancouver police are reporting a recent spike in hateful attacks against East Asian people amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the force issuing a public appeal to identify the
middle-aged suspect in the shocking assault of a 92-year-old man at a convenience store.
On Wednesday, the police released surveillance video of a March 13 attack and said that five of the 11 hate crimes reported in the city last month targeted East Asian people.
This year, there have been nine hate crimes against people of this ethnic background, a total that already represents three quarters of all hate crimes reported against this
group last year.
""Five of them were specific to what's going on right on with COVID-19 with an anti-Asian element,"" Constable Tania Visintin, a Vancouver Police Department spokeswoman, told
The Globe and Mail on Wednesday.
""Not only are we going through a pandemic and its added stress on everybody - whether it be mentally and financially - and now this is happening to this type of ethnicity?
""It's not right and we're not going to tolerate it.""
Constable Visintin could not say how many suspects in these recent hate-crime cases have had charges recommended against them or provide more complete data on how
many hate crimes were reported in the city last year and against which groups.
Police across the country don't typically release up-todate statistics on hate crimes, so it is unclear whether other police departments are seeing a similar uptick in attacks
against East Asian people amid the global pandemic that started in the Chinese city of Wuhan.
Hate-crime data across the country are collected from police each year by Statistics Canada, but it can take up to two years before this information is released to the public.
Toronto has seen no notable increase in hate crimes over the past month and a half, Toronto Police Service spokeswoman Meaghan Gray said.
""However, we also know that hate-related occurrences often go unreported to police so I'm not sure our numbers would accurately reflect the possible lived experiences for
some members of the community,"" Ms. Gray said in an e-mailed statement.
In 2018, the latest data available from Statistics Canada, there were 56 hate crimes reported to police that targeted East Asian or Southeast Asian people, out of a total of 780
hate crimes motivated by race or ethnicity.

APPLETON - Growing up in an urban area, Christa Zhang never felt wary about being Asian American.
The native St. Louisan moved to Appleton to attend Lawrence University, which she said welcomed her with open arms. She's never felt unsafe in the community despite moving
into a far less diverse area than her home city.
It wasn't until the coronavirus outbreak trickled into the local community that she started to feel uneasy about her race.
Remarks by President Donald Trump, public officials and media pundits who made it a point to tie the virus to its origin of Wuhan, China sent Zhang and other Asian Americans
into uncertainty about how they might be perceived as a result of the blame.
As reports of racist incidents, attacks and assaults started coming to light across the country in cities like New York and Los Angeles, fear started circulating even further.
And, if xenophobic incidents are occurring in large metro areas coast to coast, Zhang only fears her being more conspicuous in a smaller city like Appleton may make her a
stronger target for any public discomfort.
""It is a predominantly white area,"" Zhang said.
Zhang said when she has to go out in public, she has a heightened sense of her identity as an Asian American.
""I am afraid that if I appear sick or if I cough in public people around me will have that in the back of their head and it makes me more cautious of every move that I make,""
Zhang said.
The coronavirus pandemic has sent the country and world into a spiral of business closures, social distancing and isolation.
The outbreak of the virus began in Wuhan, but how it was started is shrouded in mystery and rumors.
Despite the inconclusive epicenter of the virus, some public officials and pundits have emphasized blame on the Chinese government for the spread of the virus, targeting the
communist regime as well as the cultural practices of Chinese residents like going to wet markets.
Trump has repeatedly referred to the virus as the ""Chinese virus"" in a battle of blame between the U.S. and China.
Chinese officials and propaganda outlets have used disinformation tactics to pass the buck on the virus by spreading a conspiracy theory that the U.S. military had planted the
virus in Wuhan, which also heightened pushback from lawmakers to place blame on China.
Claire Zhuang said she feels like even if the connotation is meant to blame the Chinese government, it can unintentionally spread xenophobic feelings.
""I think (Trump) is trying to put the blame on the Chinese government, but what it does is enable anti-Asian sentiment to come forth in the U.S.,"" Zhuang said. ""I think it
sometimes also detracts from what's really important right now because we're in the middle of a crisis and for me, I don't think the origins are really important.""
Since controversy has grown, Trump has taken a different tune agreeing to halt the use of ""Chinese virus"" to de-escalate tensions between the U.S. and China and suggested he
made it into a bigger deal than needed.
On March 23, Trump tweeted: ""It is very important that we totally protect our Asian American community in the United States and all around the world. They are amazing and
the spreading of the virus is not their fault in any way, shape or form. They are working closely with us to get rid of it. We will prevail together!""
Law enforcement officials in Wisconsin have cited an uptick of racially motivated incidents and state officials have spoken out against any acts.
Last week, the University of Wisconsin-Madison condemned chalk messages that were written on a campus sidewalk blaming the virus on China. University leaders took to a
virtual town hall to discuss the increasingly hostile climate towards Asian Americans on campus.
Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul also sent out a statement warning against any racist or xenophobic acts toward Asian Americans living in Wisconsin.
""We must stand together and speak out against racism and xenophobia,"" Kaul said.

The COVID-19 pandemic has been stressful for communities across the globe. It has perpetrated a level of anxiety in all populations,
which has led to stigma towards certain people – especially Asian Americans in the US. The current outbreak has provoked stigma in
Nepal as well. Health care workers, COVID-19 patients or suspects and people who have returned home from abroad are having to
face these stigmas.
A few days back, an adult male presented himself in our fever clinic at the Charikot Primary Health Care Centre with a history of
sore throat and cough. He had returned from South Korea a month back and had lived in self-quarantine for 21 days. None of his
family members showed any symptoms. He and his family members were, however, facing persistent discrimination from
neighbours.
He came to us after someone posted his name and address in the social media, accusing him of possibly spreading the disease in his
village. Thus, he demanded a test for COVID-19 to prove he did not have the virus.
The very next day, a young female who had returned from Dubai 11 days back came to us demanding a test. She had absolutely no
symptoms. But she came to our hospital after walking more than four hours because her community had pressured her to get the
test.
Social stigma in the context of health is the negative association between a person or group of people who share certain
characteristics and a specific disease. Mental disorders, AIDS, venereal diseases, leprosy and the like are diseases that are
stigmatised in our community – by limiting social participation. Stigma is not limited to the person suffering from the disease but
extends to one’s family members, too.
Stigma is associated with the COVID- 19 outbreak because of its highly contagious nature and relatively high mortality.
Stigmatisation has huge impact on a patient as well as the quality of care he or she receives from the health institutions. The patient
might keep away from seeking help for the illness for fear of discrimination. In Dolakha, there are lots of migrant workers from
India, and yet they are not seeking care at the nearby health centres because of this fear. Also, there are cases where after a recent
foreign country visit, people hide themselves from the community so that their family member need not go through the negative
consequences.

Nepal, April 24 -- On Wednesday, April 15, Milan Limbu was playing video games in his room when he heard a loud explosion. At first, he thought it was the sound of
fireworks. But it was 11 pm in the otherwise quiet neighbourhood of Maidstone, an English town south-east of London. Limbu looked out the window to find his parents' car
on fire.
The police and fire department were called, and the conclusion was arson-the car had deliberately been set on fire. For Limbu, the son of Ram Kumar Limbu, a former British
Gurkha, it was an attack that he'd never experienced before in Maidstone, a small town that is known as a Gurkha enclave in England.
""It was an attack on my family, on our house,"" said Limbu.
But that wasn't to be the only attack on the Gurkha community that night. Barely an hour after Limbu's parents' car was set afire, another car belonging to Basanta Maden,
also a former British Gurkha and Limbu's neighbour, was burned.
Ratna Limbu, Milan's uncle, believes that the arson attacks were racially motivated.
""We have been deeply saddened and, at the same time, badly shaken up by these incidents,"" he said. ""I am afraid that my family might also be the target of a hate crime.""
The arson attacks on Limbu and Maden are by no means isolated incidents. In recent days, physical and verbal attacks against the Nepali community in England are becoming
much more common. Many believe that this has to do with the Covid-19 pandemic, which has sparked racism and anti-Asian xenophobia across the world.
Last month, when Roshan Gurung was walking on the street of Bristol, a man directed an angry rant at him from his car.
""It was the first time that I faced racism. I get chills even remembering the incident. The man yelled at me, saying at what price I was selling bats and then he sarcastically
congratulated me for spreading Covid-19,"" said Gurung.
On March 18, Haushala Thapa Zimba reported being the target of a comment by a passerby who accused her of having brought the ""virus"" to England.
""Until then, I had never been harassed for my race. So, when racist slurs were used against me, I felt shocked, angry and unsafe at the same time. I felt like people were
judging me based on my appearance,"" said Zimba.
As the number of Covid-19 cases rises, fear and anxiety over the potentially deadly disease have led individuals and groups to scapegoat Chinese people and those of Asian
descent. Throughout history, whenever there is a major incident with global or regional implications, people have sought to allocate blame to certain vulnerable populations in
order to calm their own fears.
For instance, during the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009, Mexicans and many Latinos were scapegoated whereas people of African descent were scrutinised during the 2014
Ebola outbreak.
There is evidence that wherever outbreaks take place, people scapegoat groups that are already marginalised and treated as ""the other.""
Narayani Devkota, a lecturer at Tribhuvan University's Sociology Department, said that the Nepali community in the UK has become a target of racist crimes amidst the
outbreak of Covid-19 because they have long been regarded as ""the other"" in the predominantly white society.
""Nepalis in the UK are racially distinct immigrants who are in the minority. They are also regarded as comparatively poor in socio-economic status. These reasons may have
further triggered the racially motivated act against them during the outbreak,"" said Devkota.
According to Neelima Limbu, a resident of Dover, harassment against the Nepali community existed even before the outbreak of Covid-19.
""I work in a supermarket and I have faced comments such as 'go back to your country' several times, even before the corona outbreak,"" said Limbu. ""Most of the time, these
attackers are a small disruptive group of individuals, such as uneducated people and kids.""
Neelima, however, said misinformation regarding Covid-19 and its association with a certain ethnicity has only contributed to the hostility towards Nepalis.

Over 400 people tuned into a virtual town hall via Zoom last Thursday to hear University of Wisconsin-Madison administrators discuss responses to the COVID-19 pandemic,
most notably a recent rise in hate and racist incidents.
The university has seen 81 bias incident reports this semester, 47 of which have involved Asian or international students, said Jenna Friedman, assistant director of bias
response at the Dean of Students Office. Twenty-five reports came in response to two anti-Chinese messages written in chalk, one outside the Walgreens on State and Lake
Streets and another near the Humanities Building.
In a letter to Chancellor Rebecca Blank's office, a group of Chinese faculty members asked the university to investigate and condemn the incidents and said the university is
""faced with a grave challenge to our daily life, while carrying on our academic duties to the best of our abilities in such trying times."" It was signed by over 1,000 people.
""COVID-19 has affected all of us personally, academically and professionally, as well as physically, mentally, and socially,"" Blank said in a statement last week. ""Even so, it's
important to remember: No one person, country, or ethnicity created this pandemic - disease does not discriminate.""
Friedman said that the graffiti has been removed and the university is working with city police to find video footage.
Town hall participants submitted text questions to panelists from the Multicultural Student Center, International Student Services and the Division of Diversity, Equity and
Educational Achievement. Panelists said recent incidents have involved people coughing on individuals wearing masks or gloves, increasing stigma about wearing protective
equipment in public, which Dean of Students Christina Olstad called ""disgusting"" and ""unacceptable.""
The graffiti is no isolated incident. Despite much earlier calls from groups from the World Health Organization and the Asian American Association of Journalists to describe
COVID-19 with scientific and neutral language, analyses show increased racist rhetoric online. Earlier in March, the term ""Chinese virus,"" which was used in the graffiti, was
widely circulated online after a tweet using the term was posted by President Donald Trump.
A new online reporting forum, Stop AAPI Hate, received over 650 direct reports in just one week, according to NBC Asian America.
One of the faculty who drafted the letter, who asked to remain anonymous, said Asian faculty have experienced cases of discrimination over their past decade at UW-Madison,
amid a largely welcoming environment. The recent pandemic, however, has ""triggered and fanned this racial hatred and intolerance, and made it more publicly visible,"" the
Chinese faculty members said.
When asked how students could better organize against racism and bias, professor Cindy I-fen Cheng advised students to fight isolation from a place of connection and
community.
""There's places for hurt and anger ... but how do we bring out the best values, the kind of world that we would like to live in?"" said Cheng, director of the Asian American
Studies Program. ""Remember your student groups, remember who your safety people are and, when you feel hurt, go to them.""
Chinese faculty and students have generally found support from their peers this week, the faculty member said. Immediately following the incident, they found themselves
crying and shaking for a couple of hours, though ""great families and supportive colleagues"" calmed them down.
Samantha McCabe, interim director of International Student Services, extended a message of encouragement to international students, whom she said make up about 15% of
UW-Madison's student population.
""You are not voiceless in this,"" McCabe said.

202103,"
When an Asian-American University of Montana faculty member heard that President Trump had called COVID-19 the “Chinese virus,” her heart sank.
“Immediately I started to worry how some people will take this message and blame Chinese Americans for all the virus,” she wrote. As anti-Asian racism spread with the
pandemic, her concern grew. “With fear, I have put extra effort to minimize my Asian look. When my family and I are in public spaces … we wear hats and hoods and minimize
talking in our native language.”
This person’s name was not shared with participants in a UM online forum Friday afternoon. But another UM faculty member, Nicky Phear, read the woman's account to illustrate
the hurdles that Missoulians of Asian descent now face.
“Weeks before Montanans started the stay-at-home status,” she continued, “my family and lots of my Chinese friends had already decided to stay at home as much as possible,
because we fear the virus spread, and we fear the potential harm by other people based on our identities.”
Since the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, researchers and advocacy groups have reported a surge in harassment and hate crimes against Asian-Americans. The University of
Montana's Maureen and Mike Mansfield Center brought Missoulians together via the Zoom videoconferencing app to discuss the topic.
This rise in racism has reached Missoula, the anecdotes Phear shared made clear. Two other panelists, activist and writer Helen Zia and UM History Professor Tobin Miller
Shearer, described how these latest incidents fit a long pattern of American racism against Asians, one that also included the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, mass internment of
Japanese-Americans during World War II, and hate crimes against Asian-Americans in the 1980s, when Japan was widely blamed for the collapse of the U.S. auto industry.
Miller Shearer, director of UM's African-American Studies program, gave several suggestions for how Missoulians can help fight this latest trend — and called on white residents
to get involved. “Over the years, I’ve found that members of the white community found the process of interrupting racism very challenging,” he said, but “for those of us who
are white, this is some of the most important work that we have to do.”
Miller Shearer encouraged participants to educate themselves on how to respond to racism they encounter, and to ask Montana’s congressional delegation to support federal
efforts to counter anti-Asian racism.
As racism against Asian-Americans has risen in the United States, foreigners have faced discrimination in China. “I have absolutely no doubt that the vast majority of Chinese
are just like us … basically kind and people who want to do the right thing,” said panelist Terry Weidner, retired professor of Chinese politics. “Like us, though, they are also
flawed, and thus love a good conspiracy theory and give in to the temptation, especially in a time of fear and uncertainty, to blame others.”
He faulted both President Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping for stoking that inclination. “Both have giant egos, intolerance of any criticism, and a tendency to deflect
blame by shifting it onto others.”
Zia concurred. “I think what we are seeing worldwide, is that governments, communities, systems. are completely under stress and it is a pretty standard standard political
move for political leaders anywhere to try to deflect blame.”
But even if it’s standard, she continued, that doesn’t make it right.
“if our leaders are too busy blaming other people, where’s the attention going on to bring people together to actually solve our common problems?”
Instances of racism against Asian-Americans can be reported to the Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council at http://www.asianpacificpolicyandplanningcouncil.org/stop-aapi-
hate/. Online trainings on how to respond to anti-Asian racism are being offered through the end of May at https://www.ihollaback.org/bystanderintervention/.

202103,"
SEYMOUR —A local family confronted with apparent racially motivated threats at their Asian restaurant has been overwhelmed by the
community response.
“I didn’t expect the community to react the way that it did,” said Meng Zheng, whose parents Ju Zheng and Xuemei Chen own Sushi &
Wok. “I’m glad that it did, though.”
The restaurant has been swamped with orders, received more than 150 messages of support on social media and got an offer of $1,000
to be used to pay for the meals of local emergency responders and health workers.
The incident that put it all into motion occurred April 3 just before noon, Zheng said.
“It was right as the lunch rush was starting,” she said.
The restaurant received six calls from two different phone numbers blaming Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic and threatening
to shoot up the restaurant in a profanity-filled rant, she said. The caller also seemed to be trying to disguise his voice, Zheng said.
The calls were sufficiently alarming that her parents called Zheng at her job at Yale New Haven Hospital.
She notified the police and relayed the information since there is a language barrier. Seymour police confirmed a report had been filed
but did not respond to a request for further details.
Later, Zheng said, she began growing angry that her family had been the target of racial bias and took to the restaurant’s Facebook
page to vent.
“As we struggle to keep our business open, not only do we face the challenges of paying rent and dues, but we also deal with
harassments from people who threaten to do harm to our employees and business,” she wrote. “Many people have no idea how difficult
it is to continue operating a small restaurant with the constant fear that someone will come in and tear the place down. There is no need
to spread ignorance, hatred, and destruction in our community in a time like this.”
The response was immediate.

Among the many appalling consequences of covid-19 has been an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans.
Verbal harassment has been common, but acts of violence are on the upswing as well. In Texas, a man allegedly
tried to kill an Asian family in a grocery store (which included stabbing a 2-year-old child.)
Although the increasing harassment has been widely condemned, some voices have also suggested that the virus
represents an opportunity for Asian Americans to prove themselves as good and patriotic Americans, and thus help
eradicate such racial animosity. Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang recently argued in The Washington Post
that Asian Americans ""need to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before... We should
show without a shadow of a doubt that we are Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need.""
History, however, suggests that such an effort is not only unlikely to succeed but runs the risk of generating a
backlash that might exacerbate violence.
Almost exactly a century ago, African Americans faced similar calls to prove themselves in the midst of a war, a
pandemic and an economic recession. The black community was not blamed for starting World War I in the way
that Asian Americans have been blamed for the coronavirus. They were, however, disproportionately singled out as
potential traitors, since their standing as second-class citizens allegedly made them particularly susceptible to offers
to betray their country.

IN early March, Yuming Wang, a Philadelphia lawyer, watched with increasing concern reports of racist incidents against Asian
Americans over coronavirus fears trickle in from other cities. A Chinese woman was attacked for wearing a mask in New York City. A
16-year-old Asian American student was physically assaulted in Los Angeles.
Wang, who is the honorary chairman of the Pennsylvania United Chinese Coalition, decided to create a WeChat group for Chinese
Americans who were worried about the rising numbers of racist incidents during the pandemic. Soon after, he began working closely
with state and local police, the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations, and other law enforcement agencies to encourage
Chinese Americans who experience racist incidents to report them.
""Chinese Americans have been increasingly worried about their safety every day, and the issue is getting deeper and deeper into their
mental health concerns,"" Wang said. ""Among [the group members], the biggest concern is that when someone goes somewhere,
[they] may be attacked, verbally or physically, because of being Asian or Chinese Americans.""
Many Philadelphians are reluctant to leave their homes because of fears over contracting COVID-19. But members of the city's Asian
American communities have an additional worry - many are growing increasingly anxious about dealing with racist incidents, which
can lead to negative mental health effects.
The link between racism and mental health
The number of hate crimes against Asian Americans has been decreasing for 15 years, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report
data from 2003 to 2017. But in late March, federal law enforcement began to warn communities that hate crimes against Asian
Americans will increase as the coronavirus crisis goes on.
This concerned mental health experts, as a growing body of research indicates a link between racial discrimination and anxiety and
depression. In a 2013 review of 121 studies on the effects of racism on youth, researchers found that youth who experienced
discrimination were significantly more likely to suffer from mental health problems. A 2007 study that surveyed 2,047 Asian
Americans identified racial discrimination as a significant predictor of mental health disorders over a 12-month period.
""When people are treated unfairly, it can create a stress response called allostatic load,"" said Gilbert Gee, a professor in the
department of community health sciences at the Fielding School of Public Health at the University of California Los Angeles. ""Allostatic
load can impair the body in many ways, such as weakening our immune systems.""

Yue Qu did not expect to be spending the end of his first year of university alone in his room on a deserted campus in California.
But he had little choice.  Despite booking several tickets home to Chengdu, the flights kept getting cancelled with China and other countries imposing restrictions on air travel as
the Covid-19 pandemic escalated.
""I have two tickets for May, but I'm not confident that those flights will run. There's no reason for me to be here, and it's a stressful experience staying here all alone,"" he said.
Yue is among the roughly 350,000 Chinese students studying at US colleges and universities, the largest group of foreign students in the country.
It is not clear how many have remained in the United States since their campuses shut and other classmates headed home to finish their semesters online.
But students say the pandemic has done more than disrupt travel plans and studies.
It has also brought them face to face with an increase in anti-China sentiment and a surge in racism against Asians and Asian-Americans, and some are questioning what that
means for their futures in the US.
Among them is a graduate student in Tennessee who said he was picking up groceries when he overheard two men call him a ""Chinese virus"", a term that has been used by
Donald Trump.
""It was just after the 'Chinese virus' was first used on social media, and I was called [that] by two men when I was getting out of my car and wearing a mask,"" he said.
The student said the mask made him feel safe from infection, but that he worried his ethnicity put him in danger.
""It changes my feelings about the US and my interest in being in the US. I hope I can be respected and not be attacked when I am living here. To be honest, living in the US is
making me feel unsafe right now,"" he said, giving this as the reason he did not want to be named.
The rise in racism against Asians has been well documented, and ABC News recently reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had warned of a potential surge in hate
crimes against Asian-Americans in a report sent to law enforcement agencies around the country.
An analysis published on April 8 by the US NGO the Network Contagion Research Institute, which tracks online hate speech, found ""acute increases"" in  targeted ethnic hate as
well as  Sinophobia on niche online forums, with indications this was spilling over onto popular social media sites.
A reporting platform for coronavirus-related discrimination set up late last month by the California-based groups Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council and Chinese for
Affirmative Action received over a thousand reports of such incidents in two weeks.
The initiative is a collaboration with San Francisco State  University's Asian American Studies Department.
Anxious to avoid confrontations, some Chinese students said they had changed their daily  habits.
Eva Chen, a recent graduate working in New York, decided not to wear a mask on the subway to avoid attracting attention.
She felt the rise in racism was linked to American criticisms of Beijing for its management of the outbreak, which made some ""start to blame Chinese people"".
New York University student Lyujiang Chen stopped taking the subway altogether after hearing stories of friends being  harassed for wearing face masks on trains.
He said he loved New York and hoped to work there after he graduated, but was worried about how welcome he would be.

Eastern Washington University sociology professor Pui-Yan Lam remains hopeful despite what she called ""an alarming"" increase in anti-Asian discrimination and hate crimes
across the world as a result of the COVID-19 epidemic.
In a Tuesday interview conducted for The Spokesman-Review's Northwest Passages Book Club, Lam said there have been no recent reports of anti-Asian hate crimes from the
Spokane Police Department. But last week a reporting center co-founded by San Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department said it has received more than
1,100 reports of coronavirus discrimination from Asian Americans across the country.
""What I have heard firsthand is friends of Asian descent telling me they're worried to go out to the grocery store alone - that if they go out wearing a mask, they will attract
negative attention,"" Lam said. ""That fear is here in Spokane communities, too.""
Lam emphasized the power of language as a weapon to spread either hate or compassion.
""I think it's easy for well-meaning people to dismiss discrimination as 'just words that will go away,' "" she said. ""I would like people in Spokane to not only denounce hate, but
also to choose compassion when we speak.""
Lam said misplaced language creates an ""us vs. them"" dynamic that leads to the dehumanization of other groups - ""especially linking our group to a disease,"" she said,
referencing the World Health Organization's May 2015 ""Best Practices for the Naming of New Human Infectious Diseases"" guidelines, which seek to ""avoid causing offense to any
cultural, social, national, regional, professional or ethnic groups.""
Spokane is becoming more diverse, Lam said. ""One thing people would say to me when I first got to EWU was 'Spokane never changes' - we will always be very homogenous,""
she said. ""But I'm sure people are noticing the increased diversity, and I know most folks embrace that.""
She is looking forward to seeing Spokane County's 2020 census data, and said the many things that can happen as a result of increased diversity can ""change Spokane for the
better.""
And Lam believes the COVID-19 epidemic can be a defining moment for Spokane.
""When I take walks in my neighborhood, and people smile and wave at me - Spokanites do that - I appreciate it. At this moment, those simple gestures mean a whole lot more
to me,"" she said.
""With all the anxiety we all have to face right now, just seeing smiling, friendly faces makes me feel like I'm part of the community.""

""We're connecting and sharing information with our audience.""
Emmanuel Oppong
Board member for Jugaad Leadership Program
As COVID-19 started to spread across American communities, so too did misinformation.
A prevalent rumor on social media was that black people can't get the coronavirus — which is particularly detrimental because black people are dying from COVID-19
at much higher rates than other races.
""So despite the fact that there are CDC guidelines out there and World Health Organization guidelines out there, there are communities that are getting
misinformation,"" said Emmanuel Oppong. ""So we are using our platform to state the facts.""
Oppong, the community engagement director for the city of St. Cloud, is a board member for Jugaad Leadership Program, which trains and connects the next
generation of leaders — specifically minority leaders — with members of local boards and commissions, as well as internships and employment.
The program is hosting a weekly online series, ""Demystifying Cultural Myths."" The first presentation, which focused on physical health amid the COVID-19 pandemic,
launched Friday.
""It's meant to educate marginalized communities within Central Minnesota,"" Oppong said.
Friday's session featured Dr. Olayiwola R. Adetunji, a physician at CentraCare, who talked about the virus and how it spreads.
He also debunked myths he's heard — ranging from claims that gargling bleach can protect someone from the virus to claims that the virus is spread by mosquitoes.
He also addressed myths that people can contract the virus from eating Chinese food or that black people cannot get sick from the disease.
""The virus knows no race,"" Adetunji said.
Minnesota Department of Health statistics show white people make up more than 50% of confirmed cases in the state, while black people make up about 15% of
cases.
But the data is constantly changing and not completely reliable — in nearly 20% of confirmed cases, the patient's race is unknown.
But stories chronicling disparities are widespread.
In Louisiana, as USA Today reported last week, 70% of coronavirus-related deaths were black patients — even though they comprise less than a third of the state's
population.
Minorities could be more vulnerable to complications from the COVID-19 virus because of underlying health conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and heart
disease, Adetunji said.
""Those will increase the severity of the illness and likewise the mortality,"" he said.
The Demystifying Cultural Myths series will stream from 5:30-6:30 Fridays via Zoom and Facebook Live.

An Asian woman wearing a mask in a Manhattan subway station was beaten with an umbrella. Another Asian woman in Midtown Manhattan was punched in the face for not
wearing a mask. In London, a Singaporean was subjected to what police described as a ""racially aggravated assault"". There are more insults: People have been heard to utter
""coronavirus"" when individuals of Asian origin, particularly with Chinese features, pass by. Other slurs, such as ""kung flu"", have emerged. In times of one of the worst
pandemics to afflict humans in a century, fear and foreboding are the order of the day. At last count, the number of Covid-19 cases has crossed 800,000 and deaths have
exceeded 38,000. While scapegoating is not uncommon in difficult times, it has since taken on a nasty edge.
The President of the United States, the country with the highest count now of afflicted individuals, has repeatedly called it the ""Chinese virus"". While Mr Donald Trump has eased
back on using the term after reports of racially motivated attacks on Asian Americans, his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has stepped up talk of the ""Wuhan virus"". In fact, he
squabbled with several Group of Seven peers who wanted him to drop the term. Fortunately, however, there are enough sensible Americans around. They include former New
York mayor Michael Bloomberg, who made it a point to announce that he would dine in a Chinese restaurant.
The fact remains that China is as much a victim of the Covid-19 pandemic as any other suffering nation. While the origin of the coronavirus is thought to be in Wuhan, there is
every chance that some of what is taken as common knowledge today may be upended and reversed in the future. While Beijing should have been more prompt in alerting the
world to the virus, this should not be equated with China being responsible for the outbreak. Besides, having taken draconian measures to achieve a measure of control over the
pandemic within its borders, it has now embarked on helping many of the most critically affected nations in Europe, Africa and Asia with medical equipment and trained staff on
the ground.
Countries, including Singapore, must be especially careful to prevent this other virus - xenophobia - from taking root. While it has had many manifestations in the past, it is
currently showing up as Sinophobia. Petitions calling for a ban on travellers from China, as well as religious preachers who post on social media that the outbreak was ""divine
retribution"" for China's past actions, do an immense disservice to a nation with claims to having strict adherence to tolerance and multiracialism. While governments can, and
should, act against race-based targeting, xenophobia must ultimately be tackled from the ground up. This means that public recognition of the menace - and safe distancing
from it - is essential to thwarting it.

202103,"
More than 1,000 Asian Americans have logged on to a website to share stories of being verbally and physically attacked - many coughed at and spat upon - because the
coronavirus originated in China.
A gun-store owner in Los Angeles County - home to the largest population of Asians in the United States at 1.5 million - told The Straits Times he has seen a surge in Asian
customers in recent months, many of them first-time buyers.
There are certainly compelling reasons for Asian Americans to be fearful these days.
A Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) analysis, obtained by ABC News, ""assesses that hate crime incidents against Asian Americans likely will surge across the US... based on
the assumption that a portion of the US public will associate Covid-19 with China and Asian-American populations"".
At a Texas supermarket last month, a man stabbed a Chinese-American family, including children aged two and six, because he thought the family was infecting people with the
virus.
Hundreds of news reports about similar incidents this year prompted Dr Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, to set up an
online reporting centre for personal accounts of such experiences.
Launched on March 19 with the help of two California-based advocacy groups - the Asian Pacific Planning and Policy Council, and Chinese for Affirmative Action - the Stop AAPI
Hate website (www.a3pcon.org/stopaapihate) has amassed more than 1,000 reports, or about 100 a day, as of March 30.
""On a political level, we need to document what's going on,"" Dr Jeung explains.
""And track trends so we can have appropriate interventions at the community or policy level.""
And the initiative offers guidance for those who submit stories, ""like what to do when your kid is bullied or you face workplace discrimination"".
Some striking trends are emerging from the submissions.
NOT AN ABSTRACTION
I was waiting at a grocery store when an older white woman wearing a mask shouted a profanity at me, pulled off her mask and
theatrically coughed in my direction. I was the only non-white person in the line. I think we've reached that point where
(Asians) are no longer feeling this as an abstraction.
MR JEFF YANG, a Taiwanese-American journalist and author who recently tweeted about an encounter and got a flood of responses about
similar experiences.
DREAD AND STRESS
My wife got coughed at a park, and my son and I were shunned at a sporting goods store; it was a small incident but it was
noticeable. Like a lot of Asian Americans, we're now hyper aware of how people perceive us. And it just adds to the dread and
stress over the upcoming surge of cases and deaths from the disease itself.
DR RUSSELL JEUNG, a professor of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, who set up an online reporting centre - the Stop
AAPI Hate website (www.a3pcon.org/stopaapihate) - for personal accounts of such experiences.
Almost 90 per cent cite ""race"" as the reason for discrimination, with two-thirds of incidents involving verbal harassment.
Three times more women than men have filed reports, and only 40 per cent of victims are Chinese.
Other Asian ethnicities, or ""anybody who looks Chinese"", can be targeted too, says Dr Jeung.

Living amid a pandemic is enough to make all of us afraid. No one today, at least no one with any sense, can enjoy freedom from fear. Some of us have more reason to fear
than others. Think of our doctors and nurses, our sick and elderly. Think of our fellow citizens who have lost their livelihoods. Then think about those who have become visible
scapegoats for our predicament.
On Wednesday, a group of prominent Chinese Australians issued an open letter warning that national unity was at risk. According to the group, which includes former Australian
of the Year John Yu, writer Benjamin Law and chef Adam Liaw, ""the recent rise in anti-Chinese sentiment is driving a marked escalation in racial abuse against Asian
Australians"".
There is growing evidence of a deterioration. The Australian Human Rights Commission has recorded a spike in racial discrimination complaints. There are reports across the
country of Asian Australians experiencing verbal abuse, evictions, even physical attacks. In Sydney this week, a man was charged with intimidation after cracking a whip and
threatening people outside the Chinese consulate.
Minorities rarely fare well during pandemics. In the current case, Chinese and Asian Australians were almost certain to be targeted for backlash. For the virus did originate in
Wuhan, China. The Chinese government did fail to respond quickly enough to the outbreak.
But these aren't reasons to be vilifying or targeting anyone who looks Chinese. And they're far from good reasons to be calling COVID-19 ""the Chinese virus"", as Donald Trump
and others have christened it. Viruses don't have ethnic or racial characteristics. So far, mainstream Australian political leaders have avoided Trumpian excess. But why, then,
has anti-Chinese sentiment appeared nonetheless to grow?
Discrimination always arises from existing anxieties and prejudices. And for some time now, anti-Chinese sentiment has been brewing. Often running alongside concerns about
Chinese Communist Party ""fifth columnists"", there is unease about Chinese buyers outbidding locals at home auctions, or acquiring agricultural land.
It's fertile ground for anger to sprout. Consider the outrage over the panic hoarding of goods, including by supposed busloads of shopping ""tourists"" encroaching on
supermarkets in regional towns. The absence of evidence hasn't prevented the wide circulation of stories about Asian tourist buses launching sinister raids. Perhaps it's because
they fit neatly into existing narratives, built on suspicion.
Things could get worse. The likelihood of further economic pain and prolonged physical isolation may see prejudice and anger fester.
Yet racism poses a threat to the solidarity needed right now. As the American political scientist Francis Fukuyama has highlighted, the countries faring best in dealing with the
coronavirus are characterised by trust. What matters is ""whether citizens trust their leaders, and whether those leaders preside over a competent and effective state"".
Case in point: the US, where the human disaster is measured in deaths rapidly mounting by the thousands. The Trump administration has succeeded only in sowing a distrust of
government usually found in failed states.
The task at hand isn't just about meeting the immediate health and economic threat of the pandemic. It's also about ensuring we come out of the crisis the right way.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has to date spoken about our society and economy going into a period of hibernation. And in his speech to Parliament on Wednesday, he spoke
about ""defending and protecting Australia's national sovereignty"".
However, will we ever return to what we knew as normal? In politics, a Coalition government is acting (at least temporarily) like a social democratic one, having introduced a
massive stimulus package. Beyond politics, in work and in society, many of the old rules may no longer exist.
It's still too soon to know, but our pandemic response may end up less of a hibernation, and more of a transition. History shows that crises are often moments for transforming
society. Rather than merely a challenge of national defence, as the PM suggests, this pandemic also presents one of reconstruction.
Having pulled up the drawbridge for now, there's a risk of our national sentiment becoming too insular, too defensive. What's needed isn't so much a rallying cry of sovereignty,
but of nation-building. If we need trust, it's not only trust in government, it's trust among citizens.
The kind of nation we rebuild - the kind of social contract we re-enact - will be determined not just by government, but by us as citizens. In these extraordinary times, almost all
our lives have grown more ordinary. The little things, the gestures and exchanges between us, have taken on new meaning. All the more reason to stamp out the racism, often

As International Anti-Street Harassment Week begins, Everyday Sexism's Laura Bates reports on the pandemic side-effect few expected
There’s a joke going around on social media about women and coronavirus. No, not one of the myriad sexist gags circulating about women ‘letting themselves go’ in isolation or
men risking infection to get away from their nagging wives. This joke goes that women must love lockdown because at least creepy men aren’t able to harass them any more,
thanks to social distancing rules.
Unfortunately, in reality, the opposite seems to be true.
Since writing an article last month about the gendered impact of the pandemic, I’ve been deluged with messages from women describing their recent experiences ahead of
International Anti-Street Harassment Week, which runs until April 25.
One woman was walking down the street with her four-year old daughter when men started shouting ""slut"" at her. Another hasn't even been able to walk her dog without being
shouted at. Many have described running a distressing gauntlet of sexual comments while exercising. Women have been catcalled in their own front gardens, pursued by men in
cars and vans, and followed home.
And a significant number of women, from multiple countries, are reporting that the situation has worsened dramatically during lockdown.
“Is anyone else experiencing more street harassment than usual at this time?” asked one. “Leering and sexual harassment seems to be rife. I have never been ogled, stared at
or catcalled so frequently,” wrote another. Several simply agreed: “it seems worse now.”
A woman from Washington, who didn’t want to be named, was walking in her neighbourhood when a man started staring hard at her and then began to follow her. When she
crossed the street, so did he. Shops and businesses were shuttered - there was nowhere to go. Finally, she was able to retreat into a corner shop. He followed her. When she
asked him to leave her alone, he slammed the iron gate of the shop in anger. After he finally disappeared, she burst into tears.
“I’m used to street harassment,” told me, but during the pandemic, there is “extra fear of someone getting close to you, more fear when there aren’t witnesses, more fear when
you can’t rush into an open store for help because most of them are closed.”
Holly Kearl, founder of US non-profit Stop Street Harassment, has been collecting stories of abuse in public spaces. From Argentina to France, she says women have been
reporting a spike in street harassment during lockdown. She adds: “Racism and xenophobia is making street harassment worse for those of Asian descent in many parts of the
world, including the US, [where] there has been a huge rise in racial harassment against Asian-Americans.”
Emily May, Co-Founder and Executive Director of global grassroots movement Hollaback!, agrees, giving the example of a woman who was walking down the street when a man
shouted at her to “keep your Asian disease away”.
In Australia, Melbourne-based campaign It’s Not a Compliment has also seen “a real shift” towards “racially-motivated incidents being targeted at women by complete
strangers”. Co-founders Aakanksha Manjunath and Annelise Lecordier told me: “These are issues that have always existed in our society and only require events like this
pandemic to bubble up to the surface.”
They say widespread feelings of anger and helplessness have created “an opportunity for some to express these opinions in what they feel is now a more accepting climate…
We’ve heard stories of international students being verbally abused while wearing face masks at tram stops, racial slurs being thrown at Asian-Australians while out in public …
Now, this has started to escalate to assault with people reporting being spat on or punched for wearing a face mask. These stories are unfortunately becoming more common
and are sadly going mostly unreported.”
With the virus still spreading, some have questioned the importance of an event like International Anti-Street Harassment week during the current crisis.
But May has a robust response: “We know that this moment will change us. What we don’t know yet is how. Do we want to return to a world where girls and women receive
nasty, sexualised comments about their bodies? No. We didn’t want that world to begin with. Now we have a break in the action to rethink what we want and build towards
what's possible.”
Kearl adds: “Now is the time to plan for a future that has safer public spaces for all-to learn how to be a bystander; to talk about consent and respect and the right way to
interact in public spaces.”

TOPEKA — Fanny Fang’s immediate reaction to a Riley County commissioner’s racist remarks involved a profane two-word outburst and reflection on whether she had made a
mistake by returning to Kansas a couple of years ago.
Then the Manhattan woman, whose family owns and operates the Asian Market grocery store, realized how much she appreciates the community’s support.
After Commissioner Marvin Rodriguez suggested the threat of COVID-19 was low in the community because there were no Chinese people — he later offered a tepid apology
while noting his affinity for Chinese food — Fang refused to perpetuate the “model minority myth,” as she called it, “where we keep to ourselves and don’t say anything.”
Instead, Fang has been outspoken about the harassment of Asian Americans. She and others have called for Rodriguez to resign.
Fang returned to Manhattan a couple of years ago after studying at New York University. This is where her parents chose to make a home in 1997 when they immigrated from a
rural area of China. Before opening the grocery store, the family owned a restaurant in town.
“There was one day I picked up the phone and someone asked me if my family cooked cats and dogs,“ Fang said. ”This was when I was 10. And now at the age of 24, I’ve got a
local politician saying these things about Chinese people and COVID-19. So even 14 years later, it’s still happening in this community. And it always will.
“The difference now is I’m not 10 — I’m 24, and I now have the ability to say something. I’m not scared anymore. I have a very strong support system. I’m in this. I know it’s
going to be a fight, but if I’m going to go into a fight with anybody, I’m so glad to do it with Manhattan, Kansas.”
Fang said her anxiety skyrocketed when she heard COVID-19 broke out in China, fearing racist reaction in the United States. She has been asked in her store, sometimes by
children, if she has the virus. And she watched the terrifying video of an attack on an Asian American woman in New York City, who suffered chemical burns when a man poured
liquid on her as she took out the trash.
That anxiety was heightened by Rodriguez’s remarks during a commission meeting last month, as reported by the Manhattan Mercury.
“I know that other people are having a great problem,” he said. “And someone reminded me that in Italy, they have a lot of garment-people there, fashionists, and they have a
tremendous amount of Chinese there, and that’s where a lot of it started. So we don’t necessarily have any (Chinese people), but I think the board would like to make sure that
we’re on top of it.”
Fang’s immediate response: “Excuse my language for this, but it felt like a big f*** you.”
“I just can’t say it any other way,” she said. “It made me question why I even came back to this community.”
When Fang confronted Rodriguez at a subsequent meeting, he “apologized for the remarks and how they may have hurt people.”
“That’s not how I think,“ he said. ”I have everybody on my mind ... and I’ve got a lot of Chinese food here, and I’ve got some Chinese friends and stuff.”
Rodriguez didn’t return a phone call seeking comment for this story.
As a county commissioner, Rodriguez also serves on the county’s board of health. Shana Bender, an organizer for the Manhattan Alliance for Peace and Justice, questioned the
effect his “plainly racist” remarks would have on the rest of the department.
“How are they going to respond in a global crisis?“ Bender said. “What does that mean for our minorities who come for emergency services? Will there be a bias in place? Will
this put people at further harm because of their internal bias?”
Dennis Butler, director of the Riley County Police Department, welcomed feedback from Asian Americans who feel unsafe or wish to report bias or a hate crime.

Coronavirus-related hate crimes against Asian-Americans have risen in New York City, according to new New York Police Department data.
Since March 7, the NYPD has received complaints of 11 hate crimes related to the disease, police officials said Wednesday, ranging from harassment to assault—all of them
targeting New Yorkers with Asian backgrounds. NYPD officers have made arrests in seven of those cases.
The incidents occurred in neighborhoods in all five boroughs of the city, officials said.
In one incident, police said, a 51-year-old woman riding a bus in the Bronx was attacked by three 15-year-old girls who beat her with an umbrella, causing injuries to the
woman's face that required stitches. The girls were arrested at the scene and charged with assault as a hate crime, police said.
In another case, a woman and her boyfriend were attacked on a subway car in Brooklyn by a man who called them slurs before hitting the woman with an umbrella and
punching the man, police said. That suspect remains at large.
The jump in hate crimes related to the coronavirus comes as hate crimes fall overall, police said. There were 90 hate crimes recorded by the NYPD between Jan. 1 and March 29
of this year, compared with 112 such crimes during the same period last year.
NYPD Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison said the department is addressing virus-related hate crimes through aggressive policing and educating the public on the importance
of following laws as the pandemic grips New York .
""We can't allow this thing to separate us,"" Mr. Harrison said in an interview Wednesday. ""We have to work together, and we can't choose a certain community to blame them in
regards to what's going on.""
The NYPD will soon begin a social media campaign to promote a message of unity, he said.

Richard Green, chief executive of a Brooklyn nonprofit called the Crown Heights Youth Collective, said a misguided belief that Chinese people are responsible for the virus may
be behind some of the attacks.
""The community needs to be taught that there is not a raciality to it,"" Mr. Green said.
State Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Democrat who represents parts of Queens, said he is planning to host a series of virtual town hall meetings to build solidarity around the
pandemic.
""I am beyond disappointed that there are racists out there who are quick to blame and scapegoat us for this,"" said Mr. Kim, who was born in South Korea and raised in Queens.
Overall, crime in New York City has fallen since the virus struck , with the number of arrests falling by nearly 63% for the last week in March, compared with the same week in
2019, according to NYPD statistics.
But certain crimes have spiked, including auto thefts, which were up nearly 39% for that week, compared with the year before.

Coronavirus-related discrimination in New York City is on the rise, particularly against Asian-Americans, prompting the city to establish a new response team to handle the
complaints.
The city's Commission on Human Rights said since Feb. 1 it has received 248 complaints of discrimination spurred by fears over Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel
coronavirus . The majority of complaints were made in March and April, and about 42% have been specifically anti-Asian.
The influx of calls prompted the commission to form a task force in early April to address the incidents, including discrimination in housing or employment based on race, age,
immigration status or disability. Several of the calls were from disabled or immunocompromised tenants whose landlords or co-op boards had restricted deliveries of groceries or
other purchases.
""The response team came together because we saw that we had so many inquiries coming in after this pandemic started,"" said Sapna Raj, deputy commissioner of the
commission's law enforcement bureau. ""We realized we needed to respond rapidly to unique issues that New Yorkers were facing.""
The commission acts as a city watchdog and enforces human-rights laws. It can seek civil penalties against an individual or business accused of discrimination.
Between Feb. 1 and April 16, the commission received 105 reports of anti-Asian incidents, compared with five in the same time frame last year. Out of the discrimination
reports, 91 were for harassment, five were for housing and nine were for public accommodation.
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have risen this year as well, while the number of overall crimes in New York City has fallen. Between March 7 and April 2, the New York
Police Department has received reports of 11 hate crimes related to the disease and made seven arrests.
Following an inquiry, the human-rights commission may advise on a caller's rights and intervene, or open up a longer-term investigation. If the commission determines the
complaint to be a hate crime, the case is passed along to the NYPD Hate Crime Task Force.
As the original coronavirus outbreak in China morphed into a global pandemic , Chinese-Americans and others of Asian descent have reported more cases of racism and
discrimination. However, broader data on the discrimination is sparse.
Manjusha P. Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, said members of Asian communities may be reluctant to report incidents because of
immigration and policing concerns.
She said the organization was alerted to its first coronavirus-related discrimination issue in early February, after a middle-school child in Los Angeles was accused by another
student of having the disease. An online form for reporting similar cases that launched on March 19 has garnered about 1,500 responses across 46 states, most notably in
California and New York, ranging from refusal of service to physical attacks.
""Even though the numbers are small overall, I think it's an indication of what we're seeing across the country,"" Ms. Kulkarni said. ""All those efforts are important to get a better
understanding of the problem.""
Wayne Ho, president of the Chinese-American Planning Council, a nonprofit that provides social services to Asian-Americans, said he started noticing the fallout as early as
January, in the form of snide remarks and the avoidance of Chinese businesses.
Mr. Ho said new policies and enforcement of legislation can help protect against discrimination in housing and jobs, but an increase in harassment requires more social outreach.
""I have staff members who have been spit on by people, people have yelled at them or made comments on the subway,"" he said. ""People have thrown everything from pieces of
paper to their leftover lunch.""

While the coronavirus epidemic in China has been tamed, it has not stopped Western media, especially those in the US, from trying to exploit the crisis. They have now found
another weapon to demonize China, calling it “racist” and “xenophobic.”
This hype has been constant over the past week. The New York Times claimed “as coronavirus fades in China, nationalism and xenophobia flare.”
In China, many foreigners enjoy preferential policies, and overall, foreigners have a better life than the average Chinese. If those Western media intend to label China as “racist”
or “xenophobic,” they should dig deeper into specific incidents. The recent allegations of some Africans being discriminated in Guangzhou’s virus-control efforts were actually
enhanced measures as the city is facing the rising risk of imported cases and the measures were applied to all residents regardless of race and nationality.
It is ludicrous to see Western media reports pinning the racism label on China while there is a growing number of news reports about Chinese and Asians facing racist abuse in
the US, proving that xenophobia has flared there.
In the US, Asian Americans find themselves in the predicament of having to choose between wearing a face mask to protect themselves from the coronavirus, or not wear a
mask, to protect themselves from discrimination.
In late March, an American spat on an Asian man in a Brooklyn subway station. Reports also show children of Chinese descent in the US are refusing to wear masks at school
because they fear being verbal abused by their classmates.
On Monday night local time, Trump tweeted that he intended to sign “an Executive Order to temporarily suspend immigration into the United States,” a move some US netizens
said was xenophobic.
Despite it may be a method evaluated by experts to control the epidemic in the US. Some commented under Trump’s announcement by saying “when immigrant NYers make up
more than half of the frontline workers in NYC, the epicenter of America’s #COVID19 pandemic, the President’s response is more xenophobia & fear mongering.”
Racism issue has deep root in the US. The founding of the US south was facilitated by slavery. Even after the Civil War, which ended slavery, the country maintained
institutionalized racial discrimination which only began to be eroded in the 1970s. The continued existence of the white supremacist hate group Ku Klux Klan, is proof. In 1882,
the US enacted the Chinese Exclusion Act, prohibiting the immigration of Chinese laborers. Discrimination in the US against the Latino population, which rages on today, has its
own disgraceful backstory.
Racism and xenophobia are cancer in US society, which has not yet been cured. Among US conservative extremists, many are white supremacists.
When the coronavirus outbreak began, the ingrained mentality in US society again came to the fore, with many blaming China for the pandemic which led to acts of violence
toward Asian Americans. The Independent reported on March 24 that “hundreds of Asian Americans have been violently attacked in the last month because of “China virus”
racism voiced by [US President] Donald Trump.”
Fox News has hyped its large audience with constant and groundless accusations against China. It wouldn’t exist if its disparaging remarks and extreme ideology weren’t
supported by a large swath of Americans.
A vicious circle has been created in the US – media hype accelerates the spread of racism and xenophobia, which perpetuates unprincipled views of people and creates a market
that is supplied with unrelenting news stories and commentaries that support racist mindset.
It is uncertain whether the suspension of immigration to the US is an emergency measure or a xenophobic move that will continue after the pandemic ends.
Regardless of whether Trump is to be reelected this year, the next US president is highly likely to make adjustments on Trump’s policies, not for noble reasons but because US
politicians know immigrants have made the US what it is today. Racist and xenophobia policies only hurt the US’ unity and national interests.

The #WashTheHate campaign in the US calls for solidarity with Asian-Americans who have seen an increase of attacks since the outbreak of COVID-19. It makes clear that hate
will get you sick, even if the virus doesn't.
Since growing up in New York City, Telly Wong has witnessed the September 11 terror attacks, Hurricane Sandy and now COVID-19 - and racism aimed at Asian-Americans that
has accompanied the virus.
In addition to the growing number of news reports about Asian-Americans being attacked, one of Wong's friends told him that a stranger attacked her on the street while she
had on a mask before many other people had started wearing them - she ended up with a broken hand.
Wong said the coronavirus attacks reminded him of another series of crimes committed against Asians in the United States.
""I remember being a kid in the 80s and 90s, there was a rush of assaults and robberies and even murders of Chinese delivery men"", he told DW. ""They were just reported as hit
and runs. No one connected the dots.""
Now a senior vice president at a New York marketing and communication agency, Wong said he knew he could raise awareness of the issue and help people connect the dots
this time
He and his colleagues launched the #WashTheHate campaign on March 18 to collect and publish stories and videos of incidents that would otherwise go unnoticed. The timing
was right: A day before the planned launch, US President Donald Trump publicly called the coronavirus the ""Chinese virus.""
""Wash away the hate!""
Actor Tzi Ma is one of the campaign's supporters. He describes himself on Instagram bio as ""Hollywood's favorite Asian dad."" The Chinese-American star is known for his role in
the ""Rush Hour"" film series and recently played another Asian dad in the drama ""The Farewell.""
Ma was one of the internet and entertainment celebrities who posted a video for #WashTheHate. In his video, the 57-year-old washes his hands while talking to the camera:
""We all know washing our hands can help us prevent the coronavirus affecting us physically. But what about what the virus can do to us emotionally? We are all scared. We act
out of our fears by wearing masks, hoarding supplies and, sadly, some of us lash out at Asian-Americans as if Asian-Americans were responsible for this virus just for being of
Asian descent. Stop it. Acts of violence against Asian-Americans will not stop the spread of this virus. The next time you wash your hands, wash out the hate you may have for
your fellow Americans. Hate will get you sick, even if the virus doesn't.""
Verbal attacks, physical violence
Talking about the campaign, Ma told Variety magazine about how a driver of a car next to him at the supermarket yelled, ""You should be quarantined!"" before driving away. It
was one of many incidents happening across the United States as the coronavirus spreads.
In Texas, a Burmese-American and his two children were attacked and injured by a man with a knife. The FBI said the 19-year-old suspect likely tried to kill the family because
they looked Chinese and he believed they would spread the coronavirus.
In Brooklyn, a man yelled at a 26-year-old at a train station, telling her to, ""Go back to China! Get your temperature checked. You need to leave!"" He then went on to steal her
phone.
Between mid-March and mid-April around 1,500 attacks or harassment cases were recorded across the United States with most instances occurring in California and New York,
according to Stop AAPI Hate, an association of several NGOs in the United States that has launched a hotline to track verbal abuse, assault and hate crimes against Asian-
Americans related to the outbreak of COVID-19.
After initial shock, people look for scapegoats
While a social media campaign can't stop violence on its own, Duncan Hwang of the Asian Pacific American Network of Oregon told DW it is important to push back against
harmful narratives and highlight the challenges and experiences Asian-Americans are experiencing.
""Those incidents really shake people and make them feel uncomfortable to go out. It also normalizes violence against Asian-Americans."" Hwang said.

Governments should take urgent steps to prevent racist and xenophobic violence and discrimination linked to the
Covid-19 pandemic while prosecuting racial attacks against Asians and people of Asian descent, Human Rights
Watch today. On May 8, 2020, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said that the pandemic continues
to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering and urged governments to act
now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate.
Government leaders and senior officials in some instances have directly or indirectly encouraged hate crimes,
racism, or xenophobia by using anti-Chinese rhetoric. Several political parties and groups, including in the United
States, United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Greece, France, and Germany have also latched onto the Covid-19 crisis to
advance anti-immigrant, white supremacist, ultra-nationalist, anti-semitic, and xenophobic conspiracy theories that
demonize refugees, foreigners, prominent individuals, and political leaders.
Racism and physical attacks on Asians and people of Asian descent have spread with the Covid-19 pandemic, and
government leaders need to act decisively to address the trend, said John Sifton, Asia advocacy director.
Governments should act to expand public outreach, promote tolerance, and counter hate speech while aggressively
investigating and prosecuting hate crimes.
The UN committee responsible for monitoring compliance with the International Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Racial Discrimination, which 182 countries have ratified, has recommended that governments adopt
national action plans against racial discrimination. Plans should lay out specific approaches to combat racism and
discrimination, from enhanced policing of hate crimes to public messaging and education programming encouraging
tolerance. Governments need to take urgent action to adopt new action plans to address the wave of Covid-19
racism and xenophobia.

Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Asians and people of Asian descent have been targets of derogatory language
in media reports and statements by politicians as well as on social media platforms, where hate speech related to
Covid-19 also appears to have spread extensively. US President Donald Trump's use of the term Chinese virus and
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's use of Wuhan virus may have encouraged the use of hate speech in the US.
Although by late March Trump stepped back from using the term and issued a tweet in support of our Asian-
American community, he has not directed any specific governmental response toward protecting Asians and people
of Asian descent.
The governor of the Veneto region of Italy, an early epicenter of the pandemic, told journalists in February that the
country would be better than China in handling the virus due to Italians' culturally strong attention to hygiene,
washing hands, taking showers, whereas we have all seen the Chinese eating mice alive. He later apologized.
Brazil's education minister ridiculed Chinese people in a tweet suggesting that the pandemic was part of the
Chinese government's plan for world domination.
Increases in racist rhetoric have coincided with increases in racist attacks. Since February, Asians and people of
Asian descent around the world have been subjected to attacks and beatings, violent bullying, threats, racist abuse,
and discrimination that appear linked to the pandemic.
In Italy, the civil society group Lunaria since February has collected over 50 reports and media accounts of assaults,
verbal harassment, bullying, and discrimination against people of Asian descent. Human rights and other groups in
France, Australia, and Russia have also told Human Rights Watch of Covid-19-related attacks and harassment of
people of Asian descent.
In the UK, Asian people have been punched in the face and taunted, accused of spreading coronavirus. Two women
attacked Chinese students in Australia, punching and kicking one and yelling Go back to China and you fucking
immigrants. Two men attacked a Chinese-American in Spain and beat him so badly that he was in a coma for two
days. A man with a knife attacked a Burmese family in Texas.
In Africa, there have been reports of discrimination and attacks on Asian people accused of carrying coronavirus, as
well as foreigners generally, including in Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Africa. In Brazil, the media have reported
harassment and shunning of people of Asian descent.
In some instances, governments have imposed strict lockdowns that indiscriminately affect only foreign workers
without providing adequate health care, financial assistance, or other services that many workers now need to
survive. In early May, the Malaysian authorities carried out mass raids to detain refugees and migrant workers,
suggesting without basis that the migrant community and Rohingya refugees were responsible for the spread of
Covid-19.
Across the Middle East, persistent racist rhetoric in public discourse against foreign workers intensified after several
Covid-19 outbreaks occurred in densely populated segregated areas for foreign workers, most of whom are Asian.
Discrimination against Chinese people has also been reported in South Korea, Japan, and Indonesia.
Discrimination hasn't been limited to Asians or people of Asian descent. In India and Sri Lanka, where leaders have
done little to stop rising anti-Muslim discrimination in recent years, many apparent Covid-19-related cases of
attacks and discrimination against Muslims have been reported. In Myanmar, ultra-nationalist leaders have used the
pandemic to justify threats and hate speech against Muslims.
In Guangzhou in China, there have been growing numbers of cases of racial discrimination against Africans.
Guangzhou authorities have forced Africans and people of African descent to quarantine or demanded that building
owners evict them from apartments or hotels.
Repeatedly and publicly condemning racism is an important part of any government's response to the coronavirus,
Sifton said. Governments also need to adopt special public education initiatives, strengthen policing of hate crimes,
and offer support to communities victimized by discrimination and racially motivated attacks. Social media

companies should robustly monitor online space to prevent or mitigate the spread of hate speech and xenophobic
content.
Country-Specific Cases
United States
Anti-Asian incidents have continued in the US since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic, with numerous media
reports in February and March about attacks and discrimination linked to Covid-19. By late April, a coalition of
Asian-American groups that had created a reporting center called STOP AAPI HATE said it had received almost
1,500 reports of incidents of racism, hate speech, discrimination, and physical attacks against Asians and Asian-
Americans.
In one typical incident, a Chinese-American reported I was on the phone with my mom speaking in Mandarin when
a woman walked by and yelled 'get this corona virus chink away from me,' directed at me.
At least 125 of the incidents reported were physical attacks. Among the reported incidents: A truck drove by and
threw a [fast food franchise] drink on my back and yelled 'Hey chink, you're fucking nasty.' In another, an Asian-
American waiting for a bus said a man:
began berating me. I ignored him ... [then] an object of substantial weight was thrown at me with high velocity -
missing me but impacting the side of the bus with a sickening 'thwack.' Instantly, I sobered to an awareness in the
amount of trauma the object would have caused if it had struck my head.
The group also reported hundreds of cases in which Asian-Americans were harassed in public or barred from
businesses or transportation, yelled at in supermarkets, accused of bringing coronavirus to the US, or refused
transport in car services like Uber or Lyft.
On May 4, the Anti-Defamation League released a list of near-daily incidents of racist attacks and cases of
harassment from January through early May. For instance, on May 3, a stranger shouted at an Asian man on the
New York subway You're infected China boy, you need to get off the train and then attempted to pull the man out of
his seat.
From March through early May, there were numerous public reports of violent physical attacks on Asian Americans
including in California, Minnesota, New York, and Texas. NextShark, a website focused on Asian-American news,
only received a few messages per day before the pandemic about cases involving anti-Asian bias; now it receives
dozens.
Senior members of several Asian-American and other nongovernmental organizations have told Human Rights
Watch that many members of the Asian-American community they work with have experienced abuse or
harassment, or know someone who has.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and other federal agencies have not taken any specific actions to address
the rise in racist attacks and discrimination, although several state and local governments have set up hotlines and
directed authorities to investigate cases of attacks or discrimination.
United Kingdom
Several violent attacks against people of Asian descent were reported when the Covid-19 outbreak began in the UK
in February, including several physical attacks or beatings.
In early May, Sky News reported that data it had obtained through Freedom of Information requests to various
regional UK police forces showed at least 267 anti-Asian hate crimes recorded across the country between January
and March. In many jurisdictions, the figures for the first three months of 2020 were higher than all of 2018 or

2019. The figures from the British Transport Police between January and March, for instance, showed anti-Asian (or
anti-Chinese) hate crime incidents matching the total number of complaints during all of 2019.
Stop Hate UK, an anti-racism group, reported in March that it had received increasing numbers of calls or reports of
racism, discrimination, and verbal abuse, arising from perceptions that they are members of the Chinese
community.
The senior-most UK police official responsible for hate crime nationally has stated publicly that police forces are
monitoring anti-Asian hate crime and take such crimes seriously. In a recent release of crime statistics generally
during the Covid-19 outbreak, however, police authorities focused on crime decreasing generally, without noting the
rise in anti-Asian hate crime or indicating steps they are taking to stop it.
Several of the country's local police forces did not provide information to the Sky News Freedom of Information
requests about Covid-19-related hate crimes. This raises concerns about whether they are collecting data on anti-
Asian hate crimes and whether they are monitoring and disaggregating hate crime by ethnicity, despite clear official
guidance to do so.
Russia
On about February 20, after Russia banned Chinese citizens from entering the country, the state-owned transport
company Mosgortrans began ordering drivers of public transport in Moscow to report Chinese passengers to the
police. Staff stopped many passengers perceived to be Asian and asked for identification and the number of their
metro pass to track their movements. The Chinese embassy sent a letter to the Moscow government on February
24 asking them to take steps to stop the discriminatory practice. During the last week of February, well before
Moscow was placed under lockdown, police raided several locations to identify Chinese citizens and force them into
quarantine, regardless of their travel histories.
The Russian group SOVA, which monitors xenophobia and racism, told Human Rights Watch that there had been
increased attacks against Asians since February. It also reported a wave of insulting and racist commentary directed
at Chinese people and natives of Central Asia on social media in relation to Covid-19.
A media report by Lenta on March 29 detailed several accounts, including cases of people yelling at Asians or
Central Asians on the subway or in public, asserting that the Chinese brought coronavirus to this country. Through
March, there were also reported incidents of discriminatory actions against Asian-looking people in Nizhnevartovsk,
Ekaterinburg, Tatarstan, and Makhachkala, among other places.
Australia
A spate of cases of racist abuse and attacks and vandalism against people of Asian descent have been reported
across the country since the outbreak of Covid-19. For example, there were reports in late March in Sydney of
cases in which Death to dog eaters was painted in front of an Asian man's house and of people screaming racist
abuse at two sisters, calling them Asian dogs who brought Coronavirus here and dumb whore.
Near Melbourne, also in late March, a Chinese-Australian family's suburban home was targeted with racist
vandalism three times in the space of a week: on March 20, the family found the words COVID-19 China die spray
painted on the door of their garage. Late the following night, an unidentified person threw a large rock though one
of their windows. On March 29, the door of their garage was again spray painted, this time with the words leave
and die.
On April 15, 2 women in a group attacked 2 female Chinese students at Melbourne University, yelling racist
statements such as, Go back to China and you fucking immigrants. One of the women repeatedly punched one of
the students in the head and, after pushing her to the ground, kicked her in the torso several times.
A survey focusing on Covid-19-related racism against Asians and Asian-Australians recorded 178 incidents during
the first two weeks of April countrywide. The survey, by the community group Asian Australian Alliance, has

received about 12 reports a day since April 2, ranging from racial slurs to physical assault. The majority of racist
incidents reported - 62 percent - were against women. Australia's Human Rights Commission also reported a spike
in complaints about racist attacks. The Australian National University created a prejudice census to better collect
information about the surge of incidents linked to Covid-19.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has criticized Covid-19-related racist attacks, telling Australians to simply stop it. Alan
Tudge, Australia's acting minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, also strongly condemned the rise in
racist attacks, and a Labor parliament member, Andrew Giles, and other opposition leaders have called for the
government to restart a national anti-racism campaign.
India
Hate speech against Muslims, already a serious and growing problem since the election of the Hindu nationalist
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2015, increased in connection with the spread of Covid-19.
In April, social media and WhatsApp groups were flooded by calls for social and economic boycotts of Muslims,
including by BJP supporters. Several physical attacks on Muslims have also occurred, including of volunteers
distributing relief material, amid falsehoods accusing them of spreading the virus deliberately.
Hate speech against Muslims appears to have grown after Indian authorities announced that a large number of
Muslims had tested positive for Covid-19 after attending a mass religious congregation in Delhi, organized by the
international Islamic missionary movement Tablighi Jamaat. BJP officials fanned the flames by calling the Jamaat
meeting a Talibani crime and CoronaTerrorism. Some mainstream media supportive of the BJP have used terms like
#CoronaJihad, causing the hashtag to go viral on social media.
The situation grew so serious that the World Health Organization (WHO) issued a statement of caution, noting that
it is very important that we do not profile the cases on the basis of racial, religious, and ethnic lines.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not explicitly condemned hate speech against Muslims, but tweeted COVID19
does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language, or borders before striking. Our response and conduct
thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together. But Indian authorities at the
national and local level have not taken adequate steps to stem the increasingly toxic atmosphere or conduct
adequate investigations of attacks where appropriate.
Sri Lanka
Several government officials have made stigmatizing public comments about Sri Lanka's minority Muslim
community in the context of the pandemic, as hate speech has been reported across the country. This includes
claims that Muslims are responsible for deliberately spreading the pandemic, along with calls for boycotts of Muslim
businesses. Muslim organizations wrote to the government on April 12 to draw attention to an increase in hate
speech in Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lankan government issued a rule on March 27 that anyone who dies from Covid-19 complications must be
cremated, which is at odds with Islam religious practice. The WHO has said that cremation should be a matter of
cultural choice and available resources, and is not necessary to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Four UN special
rapporteurs issued a communication on April 8 finding that the rule was a violation of freedom of religion and also
drawing attention to anti-Muslim hate speech and the stigmatization of Muslims who had tested positive for Covid-
19. A Muslim man, Ramzy Razeek, who wrote against the cremation rule on Facebook, received death threats.
When he complained to the police, he was arrested on April 9.
International Legal Obligations

condemn racial discrimination and undertake measures aimed at eliminating racial discrimination in all its forms
and promoting understanding among all races while undertaking not to sponsor, defend, or support racial

Washington D.C. [USA], May 21 (ANI): Asian American health-care workers in the United States have reported a rise in bigoted incidents in recent weeks that has left the entire
community, who represent 6 per cent of the total population, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus pandemic.
Due to the racial hostility, some covid-19 patients refuse to be treated by the doctors and nurses from the Asian American community, who represent 18 per cent of the
country's physicians and 10 per cent of its nurse practitioners, The Washington Post reported.
And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing harassment in their daily lives, too, including racist verbal abuse and physical attacks. The Federal Bureau
of Investigation (FBI) has also warned of a potential surge in hate crimes against Asians as the coronavirus death toll mounts and stay-at-home orders are lifted.
Three Asian-American medical providers on the front lines of the pandemic spoke with the Post about the racial discrimination they faced as the virus spread on.
A man followed Lucy Li, a Chinese American doctor from the Boston hospital, spewing a profanity-laced racist tirade as she makes the rounds in the covid-19 intensive care unit.
""Why are you Chinese people killing everyone?"" Li recalled the man shouting. ""What is wrong with you? Why the f--- are you killing us?""
Stunned at first, then relieved she was not physically attacked, Li, 28, is now saddened and angered by the irony that she spends her days and nights helping save lives. Her
work inserting tubes in patients' airways has grown riskier since the coronavirus emerged -- each procedure releasing droplets and secretions that could carry viral particles.
""I'm risking my own personal health, and then to be vilified just because of what I look like,"" Li was quoted as saying.
""I try not to think about that possibility when I'm at work taking care of patients. But it's always there, at the very back of my mind,"" he added.
Some academic experts on race say President Trump's rhetoric around the virus and China has contributed to the rise in racial harassment. For weeks, Trump deliberately
referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" despite guidance from public health officials to avoid attaching locations or ethnicity to a disease. He has since tweeted that
Asian Americans are not to be blamed for the virus's spread.
""People are worried about transmission of a disease that they associate with foreignness and Asian faces,"" said Grace Kao, a Yale University sociologist, told the Post.
""Nothing erases what we look like,"" Kao added.
An analysis of self-reported incidents by Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University, shows a steady rise in reports of
harassment and assault against Asians since mid-March, with twice as many women than men saying they have been mistreated.
Jeung said he expects harassment and violence against Asian Americans to grow in coming months as states reopen their economies and people return to work, school and
public life.
""People make automatic assumptions, especially in times of threats, and go into fight-or-flight mode. The fight mode is attacking or harassing Asians, and the flight mode is
shunning Asians,"" he stated further.
Gem Manalo, a Mass General anesthesiology resident who is of Chinese and Filipino descent, was riding the ""T,"" as the subway is called in Boston, across the river to Cambridge
for a yoga class in early March when she said a man starting yelling: ""F--- China! F--- the Chinese!""
Audrey Li, an internal-medicine resident at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston and born to Chinese immigrant parents in New Jersey, who plans to specialize in
infectious diseases, said she was repeatedly told by a frustrated patient at another hospital to ""go back to your country.""
But many Asian Americans felt offended by seemingly having to justify their existence. ""You people eat bats! It shouldn't matter if you're a front-line worker,"" said Esther Choo,
an emergency-room physician in Portland, Ore., who hosts a podcast on the coronavirus pandemic.
""Every time something like this happens, there's this wave of, 'But we're so good, and we don't deserve this.' No, you don't deserve this because you're human."" (ANI)

202103,"
People can get a bit insular during a crisis. Their focus pulls inward, drawing a circle around their families and loved ones. The hardships of others tend to recede
to the periphery. But this narrowed view can get ugly when the focus shifts to laying blame; too often, people who are ""othered"" bear the brunt.
May is Asian heritage month and, in an unpleasant irony, anti-Asian hate crimes and online rhetoric are on the rise. The confluence of these opposing events
inspired Vancouver dancer and choreographer Ziyian Kwan to organize a peaceful dance action earlier this week. She chose a space outside the Chinese Cultural
Centre, which in April was vandalized with racist graffiti.
Kwan told CBC's Early Edition she was verbally accosted while visiting the site. ""Take your bike back where you came from,"" a stranger shouted. ""You people
made this up in Wuhan City and now you've brought it here to Canada.""
There's a lot to unpack in this brief, angry tirade: the myth (dispelled by scientists) the virus was manufactured in a lab; the conflation of Chinese government
actions with Asian heritage; the hideous notion of ethnicity as a disease vector. But there can be little confusion how and where the seeds of these falsehoods
were planted, and how widely they're taking root.
China's government is under legitimate and mounting scrutiny for its early handling of the virus, including from Canada's ambassador to Beijing. But the country
has become the favoured scapegoat for politicians looking to distract from their own critical failures, and fire up a nationalistic voting base.
The administration of U.S.
President Donald Trump is pushing an attack narrative against the findings of its own intelligence community. The words of the Vancouver assailant, which so
shook Kwan, might as well have been crafted in the U.S. Oval Office, where on May 6 the U.S. president told reporters: ""It could have been stopped in China. It
should have been stopped at the source, and it wasn't.""
Not one to miss an opportunity for hyperbole, he further asserted: ""This is worse than Pearl Harbor. This is worse than the World Trade Center. There's never
been an attack like this.""
A Republican election strategy based on attacking China is spelled out in a 57-page memo from the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which was leaked
to Politico, a U.S. political journal. Several candidates are going all-in.
One poisonous election ad for Florida Congressional candidate Casey Askar states: ""China unleashed the Wuhan pandemic on the world, costing trillions, costing
jobs, costing American lives.""
Another, for Texas candidate Kathaleen Walsh, depicts the ""Chinese virus"" sailing toward the U.S. ""China is a criminal enterprise masquerading as a sovereign
nation,"" the ad alleges. ""It's time to fight back.""
It's important to ask what this strategy achieves, and at what cost. Racist messaging has proved an effective way to fire up Trump's base. And red herrings about
the Wuhan lab also are fuel for conspiracy theorists, whose dependable circulation of misinformation plays an essential role in undermining democracy.
We've even seen this tactic floated in Canadian politics. In April, rookie MP and Conservative leadership candidate Derek Sloan turned on Canada's chief public
health officer, Theresa Tam, asking: ""Does she work for Canada or for China?"" Tam responded, with dignity, she would not be distracted by ""noise.""

Editor's note: This news column showcases stories from around the world that bring a touch of positivity to the fight against the deadly coronavirus.
Zou Yining, a second-year graduate student from China at Georgetown University, has found a way to stay positive during the COVID-19 pandemic - by helping others.
Zou, one of the hundreds of thousands of Chinese students in the United States, interns at a Washington DC think tank, the China Environment Forum, or CEF, at the Wilson
Center. The organization focuses on plastics-related policy research and Zou works on the CEF website.
Recently, Zou received a package from the Chinese embassy in Washington that contained protective KN95 and surgical masks, medications, sanitizing wipes and a brochure to
help Chinese students stay healthy in the US.
She also received a gift bag including fresh fruit and snacks from her supervisor, Jennifer Turner, director of the CEF, with a message expressing her hope that the interns stay
strong amid the coronavirus pandemic.
""I was moved to tears a little as my heart was warmed by such care and solicitude, and by not feeling isolated and lonely anymore,"" Zou said.
""At the beginning of this pandemic, Jennifer asked me about the situation of my family and the city they live in, and she also wanted to make donations to Chinese people. My
heart felt the warmth of her kindness and caring.""
Zou is grateful that she has a professional, friendly and active work environment, especially as discrimination toward Chinese in the US has been present since the outbreak
began.
She said she felt depressed when she saw Chinese people and Asian Americans being subjected to racist attacks on Twitter.
""I think it's time for the two countries to come together instead of blaming each other. The US and China need more mutual cooperation on global challenges,"" said Zou.
She learned that some of her colleagues volunteered amid the pandemic.
""One of my colleagues made masks with her tiny sewing machine and then donated them to community workers, cleaners and couriers,"" Zou said. ""And another colleague, who
preferred to cook at home before, decided to order takeout more frequently to support local restaurants.
""I felt really encouraged by their experiences and also wanted to support the people around me.""
Zou found the hospital closest to her, MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, and registered her donation information.
On April 28, Zou, with another classmate, donated all of her KN95 masks and three bags of disinfectant wipes to the hospital.
""At this time, I think front-line medical workers who are (more vulnerable to) COVID-19 should be protected more than us,"" Zou said. ""I feel really happy since I have an
opportunity to contribute to the common good, even though I'm not that strong.""

The spread of the novel coronavirus is triggering hate against Asian Americans. One Texas city is trying to do something about it.
The San Antonio City Council unanimously passed a resolution on Thursday denouncing bigotry, anti-Semitism, crimes against Asian Americans and ""hateful speech"" amid the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The resolution, proposed by Mayor Ron Nirenberg, states that ""COVID-19 is a public health issue, not a racial, religious or ethnic one, and the deliberate use of terms such as
'Chinese virus' or 'Kung Fu virus' to describe COVID-19 only encourages hate crimes and incidents against Asians and further spreads misinformation at a time when
communities should be working together to get through this crisis"".
The resolution also says that the Jewish community has been targeted with blame and conspiracy theories regarding the disease.
""The City of San Antonio denounces anti-Semitism, anti-Asian bigotry, and all hateful speech, violent action and the spread of misinformation related to COVID-19 that casts
blame, promotes racism or discrimination or harms the City of San Antonio Asian and Pacific Islander, Jewish, immigrant or other communities,"" the resolution says.
According to the Anti-Defamation League, or ADL, reports of xenophobic and racist incidents targeting members of the Asian-American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI,
communities in the US have surged since January.
Those incidents include Asian Americans being told to ""Go back to China"", being blamed for ""bringing the virus"" to the US, being referred to with racial slurs, spat on, and in
some extreme cases, being physically assaulted.
ADL compiled a list of anti-AAPI incidents that have been reported by media outlets across the country since January. The number of incidents is close to 100.
One of the most recent reports showed that in New York, an Asian man was attacked on the subway by a stranger who shouted at him, ""You're infected, China boy. You need to
get off the train."" The assailant then grabbed the victim and attempted to pull him out of his seat.
Some comments regarding the report of San Antonio's new anti-hate speech resolution at ksat.com have been negative, indicating that such bias and discrimination are
prevalent.
'Rather disheartening'
""It's rather disheartening to see such a large number of negative, angry, and downright crude comments that have appeared on local social media and news media websites
since the passage of this resolution by the San Antonio City Council,"" said Jon Taylor, professor and department chair of the political science and geography department at the
University of Texas at San Antonio.
""Calling people out for their hateful comments is a reminder that words can and do have meaning and consequences. Those opposed to this resolution don't see it quite that
way and view it as an infringement of their free speech rights. And that's their right as Americans. But that doesn't mean that people can't be civil,"" Taylor said.
Steven Pei, a professor at the University of Houston and honorary chair of United Chinese Americans, or UCA said: ""We appreciate very much that the San Antonio City Council
declared war against hate speeches such as 'Chinese virus' and 'Kung Fu flu' to ensure safety of the entire community.""
He pointed out that Asian Americans did not spread the virus; on the contrary, they have made great contributions to combat the virus by raising funds to donate personal
protection equipment to medical workers, first responders and communities in need across the US.

202103,"
NEW YORK — A spike in harassment of Asian-Americans since the coronavirus pandemic began has led community activists in the United States to fight back —
forming street patrols, rallying on social media, and supporting each other online.
Asians of varying national backgrounds have suffered a surge of attacks this year, which activists linked to the pandemic's emergence in China. Some said they
feared harassment could worsen in a U.S. election year, with U.S.- China tensions ratcheting up over trade, Hong Kong and the coronavirus.
""When China is made the enemy, people who look like Chinese are the enemy. The economy is tanking, people are dying. They're angry and fearful and want to
take it out on Asian Americans even more,"" said Russell Jeung, professor of Asian-American studies at San Francisco State University.
Since March 19, over 1,800 cases of harassment related to the coronavirus pandemic have been reported to Stop AAPI Hate, a website Jeung created with two
advocacy groups.
Nine out of 10 victims were targeted because of their race, with 37 per cent of incidents taking place in public areas, the organization said. Verbal harassment and
shunning occurred in over 90 per cent of the cases. Victims were physically assaulted, or coughed or spat on, in some 15 per cent of cases.
Some of the harassment has taken place inside of stores, Jeung said, adding that Stop AAPI Hate is working with retailers to figure out how to ensure safe access
for customers.
The New York City Commission on Human Rights this week launched a multilingual campaign to combat COVID- 19-related discrimination after it received over
350 such complaints from Feb. 1 to May 15. Of these, 133, or 37 per cent, targeted Asians. That compared with just 11 complaints of discrimination targeted at
Asians during the same period in 2019.
The FBI has warned of a rise in hate crimes against Asian- Americans since the coronavirus pandemic began, according to media reports citing internal documents.
SOLIDARITY ON STREETS In some Chinatowns, volunteer patrols are forming to protect residents and confront harassers. The Guardian Angels, with patrols in
over 130 cities worldwide, are recruiting in U.S. Asian communities for the first time in 41 years. Members include seniors and women, who are often targets of
abuse.
""It's boring at home. I might as well do something,"" said laid-off dental assistant Sara Chin. The 46-year-old also patrols with New York's Chinatown Block Watch.
""Our mission is to observe, record and report,"" said Leanna Louie, a San Francisco businesswoman who started patrol group United Peace Corp. In eight weeks, it
has filed 24 reports, including medical response incidents, auto burglaries, theft and shoplifting, leading to three arrests, she noted.
""We can break the old habits, old patterns and outdated stereotypes,"" Louie said. ""We have assisted in aiding the community to step out of the shadows and feel
more empowered."" The San Francisco Police Department has expanded its presence on foot and in cars around the city to act as a deterrent against such crimes, it
said in a statement.
In New York, flyers and posters emblazoned with the words 'Don't be cruel' were created by Shirley Ng and her friends for display on Chinatown storefronts, with
pointers on how to report a crime.
""I don't have to wait for support. It's my community,"" said Ng, an events assistant at the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund.

202103,"
The coronavirus has fostered the best and the worst in Canadians.
The best are the nurses and doctors who have come out of retirement to help those already in the health-care trenches.
The best is all the retail sector workers who staff the grocery stores and pharmacies to keep the public fed and prescriptions filled.
Add those working in nursing homes and others collecting garbage and recycling.
The worst is the attack on Asian Canadians, both verbal and physical.
A much larger white guy punches a small Asian in the face. Another yells at two Asian women aboard a Vancouver bus. ""Go back to
your country; that's where it all started.""
And Canadian singer Bryan Adams goes into a Twitter rant condemning ""bat-eating, wet-market animal selling, virus-making greedy
bastards"" who are responsible for turning the world on end by introducing the world to the pandemic.
Adams was accused of racism and apologized. I don't know why.
Many news agencies, including CBS, USA Today and closer to home, CTV News, posit the virus may have indeed been carried by a
bat, spread to an intermediary animal that in turn was sold at an unsanitary so-called ""wet market"" in Hunan province in China. If
you have looked up these markets online you can easily see the filthy conditions that could spawn this pandemic.
There is no chance the virus was created in a Chinese lab, say American, British and Australian researchers.
Adams is quite likely speaking the truth and if you don't like it, too bad.
But abusive language and physical violence against Chinese Canadians - in some cases lumping all Asians together - is flat out
wrong.
The overall Canadian favourability toward China has plummeted to 14 per cent, according to an Angus Reid Institute poll. And 85 per
cent say the Chinese government has not been honest or transparent about the pandemic.
In other words, it is not the Chinese, it is the Chinese government our anger should be directed toward.

Naperville officially denounces racism, moves toward inclusion action steps A resolution is on the books and an action plan is in place celebrating diversity and denouncing all
acts of racism, intolerance and discrimination in Naperville.
The steps come after several occasions of reported racist acts at schools, restaurants and gas stations in the city and after what the resolution calls an ""increase in anti-Asian
sentiment across the country caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.""
City council members approved the resolution unanimously during a virtual meeting after hearing written comments from 10 residents and spoken statements from three others
calling for public solidarity against racism. Speakers represented the Chinese, Japanese, Jewish and Latino communities.
""The most recent incidents concerning African Americans, and most recently, Asian American backlash, have sadly opened up new wounds, as I have felt that our city has been
progressively moving toward greater acceptance of diversity,"" Naperville native Christine Simonson said in written comments read aloud during the meeting. ""As Naperville
continues to become more diverse, I feel it is necessary for everyone to embrace and respect everyone’s differences.""
The council also unanimously approved recommendations that call for implicit bias training and diversity recruiting enhancements for city staff members, development of a
human relations commission, and engagement with community groups to further equity and inclusion.
City council members thanked Chinese community leader Nancy Chen Chen — she reached out a month ago seeking a city denouncement of acts against Asian Americans —
and city council member Benny White for his creation of an inclusive discussion group called Naperville Neighbors United.
""We applaud your leadership in standing up against racism in all forms,"" Lucy Chen, board chairwoman of the The United Chinese Americans Illinois Chapter, said in written
comments.
Resident Karen Peck said in written comments she is ""saddened that such a resolution needs to be codified.""
But a few residents in written comments shared stories of what Simonson described as ""daily tormenting"" based on her race, or what Jennifer Chen called ""an ugly racial
incident"" at a football game.
""As much as I loved and benefited from the Naperville I grew up in, I am sad to say that I can still recall every act of discrimination I witnessed in our school,"" Chen said in
written comments. ""I do not wish these types of life lessons on any kid today. And that’s why this resolution — this commitment to our community, our kids, our families and
our businesses — will continue to bolster Naperville’s strong reputation for being a place people choose to live.""
Mayor Steve Chirico said it was sad but important to hear stories of past discriminatory treatment. He called the resolution and action steps denouncing racism ""a long time
coming.""
White encouraged everyone to follow intent of the city actions by speaking up when improper treatment occurs.
""Step up and say something about it,"" White said. ""Say, ‘Hey, not in my town.’""

202103,"
Sri Lanka, May 26 -- Australia is entering what observers here say could be a deep recession, the first in almost 30
years. It was the rise of China that helped this sparsely populated vast continent to avoid a recession for the past
three decades, the most extended period of economic growth in Australian history.
Rather than being thankful to China, Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne in a local TV interview on April 19
called for an ""independent"" inquiry into the origins of COVID-19 in Wuhan expressing concerns about transparency
from China on the issue.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison emphasised that in subsequent media briefings and he led a campaign with the
support of the European Union (EU) to press the World Health Assembly (WHA) to trigger an independent probe.
Though the WHA passed the resolution on May 15 with China co-sponsoring it, the outcome was far from what
Australia (and the U.S.) wanted. It even led to a spat with the Chinese Embassy in Canberra that issued a
statement saying that it is ""a joke"" to claim that the WHO adopted the Australian initiative.
""Australia and the United States have been particularly close since the Second World War. When we were at risk of
invasion they became our Allies and remained so,"" former Immigration Minister Phillip Ruddock told IDN in an
interview.
When asked how the Government of John Howard - who publicly said that Australia could be the U.S.'s deputy
Sheriff in Asia - handled the relationship with China, he said. ""(We were) able to manage some difficult issues with
China through regular Human Rights dialogues."" Ruddock was part of the Howard Cabinet.
""independent"" investigation

Morrison started the campaign for a so-called ""independent"" investigation, at a time when the media coverage here
on the COVID-19 issue had invoked the ""yellow peril"" prejudices of the 19th century that fuelled the 'White
Australia' policy. It was lifted only in the late 1970s when Asia was seen as a potential cash cow for Australia. It did,
and until the advent of COVID-19, tourists and international students from China, and Chinese mineral and food
imports were the major foreign currency earners for the country going into billions of dollars.
""We need to look at the risk factors of the pandemic and the cost and benefits. A blame game will not achieve a
constructive and beneficial bilateral relationship between Australia and China,"" argues Tony Pang, past president of
Chinese Australian Forum, pointing out that 90 per cent of Australian exports go to Asia with China taking 37.2 per
cent of it. At the same time, the U.S. accounts for only 3.8 per cent according to 2019 data.
""I believe, to some extent, the current racism against Asians is a result of China's growth, influence and economic
might and the adverse media coverage over the last few years, and especially after the arrival of Covid-19,"" he told
IDN.
Andrew Jakubowicz, Emeritus Professor of Sociology from the University of Technology Sydney told IDN in an
interview that ""the language used was either intentionally inflammatory or recklessly loose and undisciplined"".
He added: ""Even China recognises that an inquiry-based on the scientific method that rigorously interrogates the
emergence of the virus and the more or less successful modes of address across the world, is an excellent idea.
Though not one that seeks out evidence to convict China of some unnamed crime"".
In the past two weeks, China has shown in no uncertain terms, through media briefing from China's Ambassador
Jingye Cheng in Canberra and Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijianin in Beijing that the Chinese Government is
unhappy with the way Australia called for such an inquiry. They have already imposed economic sanctions against
Australia dressed up as anti-dumping and hygienic measures.
On May 18, the Chinese Government announced it would press ahead with its threat to impose an 80 per cent tariff
on Australian barley - effectively blocking Australian farmers from selling their crops to their most lucrative market.
They claimed that the Australian Government was subsidising the farmers to ""dump"" barley on the Chinese market
at below production costs.
On May 19, Beijing has slapped Australian beef exporters with sanctions for ""repeated violations of inspection and
quarantine requirements"". Trade Minister Simon Birmingham was at pains not to paint it as economic retaliation
from China, but ""isolated labelling error"" that will be corrected.
COVID-19 lockdowns
Sanctions could hit hard on an economy already facing a severe crisis from both the impact of bushfires in the
summer and now COVID-19 lockdowns. This week Birmingham complained that his Chinese counterpart was
refusing to take calls to discuss the issue. He has hinted that Australia may have to take the barley tariffs to the
WTO disputes process.
The Chinese ambassador has also hinted at the Chinese consumers ""losing the taste"" for Australian wines. China is
Australia's biggest wine market. Wine-maker Bill Widen told ABC TV that for three years they have been selling
wines to China. Before the COVID-19 crisis, they have been sending every two months a container full of 18,000
bottles of wine to China. ""The most popular wine at the moment in China, by volume, is Australian wine, so
Australian producers have made inroads into the China market,"" he said.
His wife Vicki visibly upset at the impact Australia's call for an inquiry may have on their business added: ""You
spend many many years building a relationship with a country. And if you lose that relationship with China . it will
be devastating, not only for us here.""
Australian commercial media, in particular, have been drumming up anti-China sentiments in the country by
repeatedly claiming that China is using its economic muscle to bully Australia, after spreading the coronavirus

across the globe. They are also appealing to widespread resentments among Australians of Chinese purchases of
large Australian assets as well as real estate in recent years.
""Australia has taken the view that the purchase of Australian assets by Chinese state corporations has strategic as
well as economic parameters,"" argues Professor Jakubowicz. He commented on why there is no such resentment
against widespread purchases of Australian assets by the British and American companies.
""My sense is (that) the perceived threat of Chinese imperial power from a one-party state bent on extending its
empire, is more challenging in Australia than competing corporate interests from other former or existing empires.""
This resentment of Chinese economic power and the media's persistent attempts to project COVID-19 as a 'Chinese
export' is reflected in a rise in racist attacks on Asian (Chinese)-Australians in recent months, where ordinary
Australians have called them spreaders of coronavirus.
""I have been verbally racially abused several times since the arrival of COVID-19,"" says Pang. ""My wife, a third-
generation Australian, was called 'coronavirus'. Her grandfather arrived in Australia from China in the late 1800s.""
Her Chinese-Australian father had served with the Australian Armoured Division in World War II (1939-1945) and
her uncle in Borneo as an Infantry.
""My friend's daughter was spitted on, and his shoulder elbowed another friend at a supermarket by a male,"" he
adds.
[The Borneo campaign of 1945 was one of the most complex operations involving Australian land, air and sea
forces in the war. It was also the last Australian campaign to be planned and undertaken. Borneo had been
captured by the Japanese in early 1942.]
Trent Zimmerman, Member of Parliament for North Sydney - an electorate that includes over 20,000 Asian-
Australians - raised the issue of such public attacks in parliament in Canberra on May 18.
""It does disappoint me enormously to have to rise in this chamber to raise and condemn the racism experienced by
some in the Australian Chinese community during this pandemic,"" he told the parliament.
While admitting that most Australians would support the call for an independent international inquiry on the role of
wet markets in the origins of the coronavirus, these attacks ""are not what this is about"", he noted.
With the Government taking a blame game strategy, there are concerns among liberal and academic circles that the
community sentiments that led to the 'White Australia' policy may be re-emerging.
But, Ruddock argues that Australia's approach to foreign investments is not different from China's. ""All substantial
proposals are reviewed through the Foreign Investment Review Board. This is not surprising. Even China takes a
critical view of foreign investment in China,"" he says. He adds: ""Government policy is non-discriminatory based on
race (but) restrictions on ownership by foreign nationals do exist.""
As for the 'White Australia' policy resurfacing, Ruddock says, ""(it) was abandoned some 50 years ago and there is
no place in Australia for any discrimination based on race, country of origin, culture or religion"".
Professor Jakubowicz agrees that the abolition of the 'White Australia' policy ""has worked reasonably well"".
However, he thinks that racialised thinking still sits strongly within the hierarchies of political parties, in the mass
media, and the public sphere. ""COVID-19 period has permitted racists to target Chinese and other Asian
Australians, but there has also been widespread civil society push back,"" he points out. But, Pang has reservations.
""Many of my Asian Australian friends are shocked at the sudden spate of racism arising from COVID-19, despite
efforts from community organisations' initiative to call on media and politicians to curtail racism, the incidence of
racism continues,"" he maintains.

Mexican law enforcement investigating the killing of a Chinese immigrant in Chihuahua state are discarding the fatal shooting was a case of racial discrimination linked to the
COVID-19 pandemic.
The Chihuahua attorney general's office has not released the man's identity but reported he had resided in Mexico for five years.
The immigrant died from a gunshot wound to the head in the Chihuahua City area last week, the attorney general's office said. There have been no arrests.
Chihuahua state has widespread drug-related violence and homicides often go unsolved. Chihuahua City has been ranked among the world's most dangerous cities.
Chinese migration to the state of Chihuahua dates back to at least the 1870s with the growth of the railroad.
A news article on the Debate news website identified the man as Wujie Liang and had claimed that he was found beaten to death.
The Chihuahua attorney general's office issued a brief statement on April 22 saying it was conducting ""a serious and professional"" investigation and that it had ""discarded"" the
theory that the homicide was motivated by discrimination or possible COVID-19 infection fears.
In the U.S., Asian Americans have become targets of harassment, bigotry and attacks as the pandemic that began in China has spread, USA TODAY reported.
On March 14, three members of an Asian American family, including 2-year-old and a 6-year-old, were stabbed in a Sam's Club store in Midland, Texas, in what the FBI listed as
a a hate crime. The victims survived.
""The suspect indicated that he stabbed the family because he thought the family was Chinese, and infecting people with the coronavirus,"" stated an FBI analysis quoted by ABC
News.
Jose L. Gomez III, 19, was arrested on three counts of attempted capital murder in connection with the stabbing, the Midland Reporter-Telegram reported.
Though most Mexicans support health care workers, misinformed fears about the spread of COVID-19 infections have also resulted in harassment, threats and attacks on
nurses, doctors and other medical workers in Mexico, El Universal newspaper reported. In one incident, a stranger threw bleach at a nurse in Sinaloa state.
There are 398 confirmed case of COVID-19 in Chihuahua state, including 259 in Juárez and 103 in Chihuahua City, according to a state public health briefing Wednesday
morning. There have been 75 deaths across the state, including 64 in Juárez and eight in Chihuahua City.
There have been 17,799 confirmed cases and 1,732 confirmed deaths from COVID-19 in Mexico as of Wednesday evening, according to the Mexican government.

Life is funny, even when it isn’t. It’s a conundrum that confronts comedians every day.
Except right now, the challenge is a bit more complicated: A public health crisis. An economic crisis. And no live shows.
Related: A few ideas to replace the war metaphor for coronavirus
For bilingual comedians Joanna Hausmann and Joe Wong, there’s another challenge: Their audiences aren’t just in the United States.
They are two bilingual performers whose comedy is being reshaped by the events of this year.
Joanna Hausmann: Family as support - and material
Hausmann was raised in Venezuela and lives in New York. She’s known for a series of videos about differences between Latin American countries. She’s also a correspondent on
Netflix’s “Bill Nye Saves the World.” Right before the pandemic struck New York City, she left for Massachusetts to stay with her parents, “isolated from any other human being
other than my family.”
And so, her family has become the subject of her quarantine videos.
Hausmann actually can’t imagine going through the pandemic without having family around. In Latin America, it’s the norm.
“Back home in Venezuela, the people that are with the most amount of family members are doing the best. Those that are the most isolated are not doing so great.”
Joanna Hausmann, comedian
“Back home in Venezuela, the people that are with the most amount of family members are doing the best,” she said. “Those that are the most isolated are not doing so great.”
At her parents’ house, Hausmann doesn’t have the professional crew she normally works with. So, she’s enlisted her younger cousin who’s learning on the fly how to edit video.
The realization that her work doesn’t need to be perfect has been liberating for her.
Related: The Netherlands to immigrants: Speak Dutch
“There’s no reason why I shouldn't post that video that I shot on an iPhone,” she said. “Or that weird front-facing video of my mom yelling at me a hundred times in Spanish,
‘What am I doing?’”
She has many other quarantine videos, like this:
Joe Wong: Tackling coronavirus-related racism
Staying at home has been more of a challenge for Joe Wong. He’s mainly a stand-up comedian, feeding off live audiences. Recently, he appeared on “The Late Show With
Stephen Colbert.”
Wong is a star not just here but in his native China, too, where he hosts a game show called, “Is it True?”
Related: Is the polyglot brain different? MIT researchers are trying to find out.
Wong was supposed to be recording a new season of “Is it True?” but it’s been postponed. Instead, he’s at home in Southern California. He has a 13-year-old, American-born
son whom he’s trying to cook for.

Clara Kan and her mother were just beginning a seaside stroll last week in Richmond, B.C., when two men in a car hurled a racial slur at them and
shouted: ""Go back to China.""
The women, who were wearing masks, confronted the driver, an older white man, who then revved the engine and lurched the car toward Ms. Kan
before driving off.
Ms. Kan's 65-year-old mother screamed for help and the men drove off. Ms. Kan immediately reported the incident to the RCMP.
Since the altercation, she says, her mother is scared to resume their daily walks in public parks and only feels comfortable shopping at Chinese
supermarkets, where the majority of other shoppers are East Asian.
Ms. Kan is adamant that she will never remain silent about the kind of abuse she, her mother and many other East Asian Canadians are facing.
""What concerns me most is a lot of Chinese people or Asian people they're like, ‘Oh, let it go, just walk away,' but I feel like maybe in a way because I
was bold enough to confront these racists maybe that's why physical violence didn't occur,"" says Ms. Kan, 33.

What happened to the Kans is one of many cases of harassment against East Asian people that have taken place across the country since the pandemic
began.
They are being targeted as being responsible for the devastation being wrought by COVID-19, which originated in China.
Vancouver police have tallied 20 hate incidents directed at people of East Asian descent this year to date, compared with 12 recorded in all of 2019.
Many of them are violent, including an incident in March when a white man shoved a 92-year-old East Asian man with dementia out the doors of a busy
convenience store. The police investigation into that incident is continuing.
This week, transit police revealed a mid-April incident in which a white man told two East Asian women on a bus to ""Go back to your country; that's
where it all started."" When another woman intervened, the man attacked her, ripping a clump of her hair out before he fled. The day after talking about
the incident, transit police announced that the 48-year-old suspect in the case had died of an apparent drug overdose a week after the attack.
Hate-fuelled incidents, from racist comments to violent assaults, have been taking place across Canada. Amy Go, president of Chinese Canadian
National Council for Social Justice, says immediate action is needed against this wave of bigotry, such as a public-information campaign denouncing it.
""In this heightened climate of hate, something has to be done,"" Ms. Go says.
Inthida Ngeth, senior vice-president of the North American Association of Asian Professionals (Toronto Chapter), agrees.
""This is like nothing we have seen before.
As everyone is trying to cope mentally, physically and psychologically with their fears, survival and everything in between - this harassment has created
even more anxiety for the Asian community at large,"" she says in a statement.
While many police departments reached by The Globe and Mail across the country say they do not keep detailed statistics showing a spike in hate
crimes over the past two months, many say they are investigating specific cases of East Asian harassment amidst the pandemic.
In Hamilton, Acting Staff Sergeant Paul Corrigan of the force's hate crimes unit says a man drove his vehicle into an East Asian man at a gas station in
March after a dispute over the victim not moving his vehicle quickly enough. The attacker also used a racial slur. The victim was not injured.
He also cites three other incidents - two involving members of the East Asian community being told to ""Go back to your country"" and one shout of ""You
brought this disease here."" The incidents were not considered criminal offences, but were recorded to create ""a truer picture of the extent of hate in our
community,"" Staff Sgt. Corrigan says.
""There may be more that I am not aware of.""
Superintendent Ricky Veerappan of the York Regional Police department, which serves 1.1 million residents north of Toronto, says the force has received
a few calls from members of East Asian communities who have been targeted with ""nasty racial comments."" No charges have been laid, he says, but
officers are asking for victims of abuse to call police.
Montreal police are investigating a wave of high-profile property damage at several Buddhist temples. They are treating the repeated sledgehammering
of the lion statues that guard these holy sites as hate crimes because they are religious symbols.
Calgary police heard from the community that there were other hate incidents after the force went public in mid-March with their investigation into
anonymous threats made against a Chinese restaurant, spokesperson Corwin Odland says.
""We are in the process of following up with them to get details and open investigations as appropriate,"" Mr. Odland states in an e-mail exchange.
Adam Palmer, the Chief Constable of the Vancouver Police Department, speaking in his role as president of the Canadian Association of Chiefs of Police,
says public awareness and police outreach are key to handling these incidents. ""Like many public safety issues, a key to prevention for hate-related
crime and incidents is awareness,"" he says in a statement.
""It's important for police agencies across the country to continue to connect with targeted communities to increase comfort with the criminal justice
system and decrease any barriers that may exist to reporting these incidents to police.""
Barbara Perry, an expert on hate crimes and professor of criminology at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, says the incidents targeting
East Asian people are part of a broader pattern of anti-Asian hatred that casts Asians as economic and physical threats.
""We saw this in the context of the failure of the North American auto industry in the 1980s, and during the SARS epidemic in the 2000s,"" Prof. Perry
says in an e-mail exchange. ""COVID has exacerbated underlying anxieties around immigration and multiculturalism to be sure, but also the strains of
economic uncertainty.""
Non-governmental organizations have stepped in to try to track incidents of hate and spread awareness of their pervasiveness.
Ms. Go's organization recently began asking victims to submit their accounts of coronavirus-related incidents of discrimination or racism as part of a
national project funded by the Department of Canadian Heritage.
The Alberta Hate Crimes Committee has also been running the StopHateAB.ca portal since 2017 to encourage people to report incidents and talk about
what happened to them, Irfan Chaudhry, director of MacEwan University's Office of Human Rights, Diversity, and Equity, recently analyzed the reports

Vancouver journalist who writes about civic affairs Among the innumerable sorrows the coronavirus pandemic has heaped upon us, the surge of racist attacks against people of
Asian descent is one of the most despicable.
Canada, which fancies itself a country of people from diverse ethnicities who all get along, has not been immune.
When people are fearful - and who hasn't been lately - they seek to blame. Right now, the scapegoat is China, where COVID-19 first struck, and by extension anyone who looks
Asian.
Take the recent attack by a white man on a Vancouver bus whose anger was fuelled by two Asian women wearing masks. Police say he yelled, ""Go back to your country. That's
where it all started."" When another woman spoke out against the remarks, he kicked her and yanked her hair so hard a clump of it fell out.
In Toronto an Asian nurse, also wearing a mask, reported she was yelled at, spit on and smacked with an umbrella by a white woman who yelled at her to go back to where she
came from.
The sentiment that China and its people are responsible for the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus is being perpetuated by people in the highest levels of government in the
United States, including President Donald Trump himself.
The President's remarks are certainly egging on those looking to place blame. But to say Mr. Trump is responsible for racist displays here in Canada is to deny our own history.
Racism underpinned policies prohibiting Chinese labourers from bringing their families to Canada when they came to build the railways. It also drove the decision to intern
Japanese Canadians during the Second World War. More recently, it led to nasty rhetoric against wealthy Chinese investors who were encouraged by developers and politicians
to buy homes and businesses here and then blamed for the exponential rise in property values.
Scratch the surface, and it seems Canada's ""Yellow Peril"" ideologies are still very alive.
COVID-19's origin in China isn't in and of itself racist. And to keep the virus in check, scientists must determine its origin (likely bats) and learn how it jumped to some other
animal that people touch or eat. If, as most scientists believe, the virus originated in a Wuhan market where many types of live animals were sold, there will need to be
changes.
The Chinese government has already made it illegal to sell or eat wild animals and further restrictions and hygiene improvements could be in order.

Sometimes it takes an outsider to hold a mirror up and shed light on the problems we gloss over. And racism, unfortunately, is one of those problems OUR greatest blessing is
our greatest curse.
Living on this beautiful island continent means our borders have protected us from the worst of COVID-19, and yet this isolated lifestyle has infected us with a singularly insular
attitude.
And unfortunately, we can’t blame the pandemic for this behaviour. When I arrived on the Gold Coast in 1991 at the age of 15, I was shocked by the racism on display. And
that’s quite a statement from someone who grew up in Texas.
While the US has always had a race problem, perhaps it simply hides it better. Certainly that was my experience in 1980s Dallas when it came to Asian-American classmates …
their culture was not an issue. And actually, their culture was primarily American.
Then I moved here and heard phrases and slurs that I never even knew existed. These racial smears were uttered not only by adults who should know better, but by my own
teenage “friends’’ who would shout such things at total strangers in Pacific Fair.
I was certainly not in Texas any more.
In the ensuing decades, I honestly do believe Australians have bettered their behaviour.
Pauline Hanson’s warnings of an “Asian invasion’’ notwithstanding, Aussies have mostly welcomed our Asian neighbours.
But this virus has seen a relapse in racial ignorance.
Last week a friend was finally able to visit her favourite nail salon and asked her technician, a woman originally from South Korea now raising her family here on the Coast, how
her world had changed since her business was forced to close in March.
The woman broke down, saying she was heartbroken and wanted to return to her parents. She said since the outbreak of coronavirus she had been verbally abused, beeped at
on the road, and denigrated by her fellow city residents. And all this while in the company of her own children.
Gold Coast, we are much better than this.
And yet her experience is not isolated.
Just last month, police issued a stern warning to Queenslanders following a massive spike in the number of racially motivated attacks against the Chinese community during the
coronavirus pandemic.
Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll and Police Minister Mark Ryan said the abuse that Chinese Australians were experiencing during the crisis was “abhorrent’’.
We don’t need to agree with China’s Government, we don’t even need to like China’s Government, I know I certainly don’t. But that has nothing to do with Chinese people who
live here, let alone anyone of Asian descent in our city.
And so I choose to believe that this behaviour stems from a very vocal but very small minority of imbeciles.
And so I choose to believe that my own children’s friends would never repeat the slurs of my 1990s classmates.

STEVENS POINT - Police have arrested a 57-year-old man they say hurled racial slurs at grocery shoppers of Asian descent May 12 because they were wearing protective face
masks.
The customers said the man called them names and harassed them for wearing masks, said Stevens Point Police Lt. Dana Williams.
""It was an intentional comment made toward Asian victims,"" Williams said.
The Police Department said the man is white but didn't identify the specific ethnicity of the shoppers. However, the department said it has learned members of the Stevens Point
Hmong and Asian community have seen an increase in harassment since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Our community will not tolerate disparaging behavior and harassment,"" the Police Department said in a Facebook post. The department ""strongly encourages anyone who may
have experienced this type of criminal behavior to contact law enforcement immediately.""
Law enforcement officials in Wisconsin last month noted an uptick of racially motivated incidents related to the coronavirus, noting that harassers had apparently blamed Asian
Americans because the pandemic has its origins in China.
The University of Wisconsin-Madison condemned chalk messages on a campus sidewalk blaming the virus on China and held a virtual town hall to warn against any racist or
xenophobic acts toward Asian Americans living in Wisconsin.
State Attorney General Josh Kaul has cited a Wisconsin statute that would penalize anyone convicted of a hate crime with a fine up to $10,000 or one year in jail.
Wausau Police Chief Ben Bliven told USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin earlier this spring that there had been one reported incident of what was believed to be a racially
motivated incident. Bliven said police did not make an arrest in that instance.
At that same time, Marathon County Sheriff Scott Parks said there were ongoing investigations of people spitting or coughing on others and vandalizing homes and businesses
of the county's Asian population.
""They are being victimized because misguided individuals have decided to attack them due to the COVID-19 pandemic that is impacting this nation,"" Parks wrote in a Facebook
post.
An officer arrested the man on a suspected charge of disorderly conduct as a hate crime, Williams said. As of Tuesday morning, the man had not been officially charged.
Anyone who is harassed or who sees other people being harassed in Stevens Point should call the Police Department at 715-346-1500. The department is taking the reports
seriously and will investigate, Williams said.

A century of racist attacks detailed in the new PBS documentary series “Asian Americans” might have felt like ancient history just a few months ago.
But through the lens of the coronavirus pandemic that originated in China and is now hitting the U.S., being painted as a foreign enemy has become all too familiar. Hundreds of
Asian Americans have reported verbal and physical assaults since the nation's first infections surfaced in January. Even in cities with large Asian communities, people have
hurled century-old slurs like “Chinaman.""
Daniel Dae Kim, a Korean American actor known for TV's “Lost"" and “Hawaii Five-0,"" faced racist trolling when he shared his COVID-19 diagnosis on Instagram in March. Kim,
who narrates the documentary with actress Tamlyn Tomita, has recovered and feels ""back to 100%.”
“It’s been very eye-opening to see how much prejudice still exists in America and how deep seated it seems to be. But it’s part of the price one pays for speaking out, even
against something as seemingly universal as injustice,” Kim said in an email to The Associated Press.
The five-episode series airing between Monday and Tuesday is a sweeping look at Asian Americans' impact on society, politics and pop culture from the mid-19th century
through 9/11. Produced by Asian American filmmakers, the show features reflections from U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, “Fresh Off the Boat” star Randall Park and a host of
people from other industries. There are also interviews with descendants whose family stories are heavily featured.
May is Asian Pacific American Heritage Month, when Asians' contributions to the American landscape are often highlighted.
The virus-related attacks, however, have been a stark reminder of how quickly Asian Americans can go from neighbor to scapegoat. In a Los Angeles Times editorial last month,
Korean American actor John Cho wrote how “belonging is conditional. One moment we are Americans, the next we are all foreigners, who ‘brought’ the virus here.”
That anti-Asian sentiment is all the more reason the documentary needs to be seen now, Kim said.
“Those who forget history are condemned to repeat it,” Kim said. “Asian Americans have a unique history in America. It’s one that should be celebrated as an indispensable part
of our nation’s history.”
Renee Tajima-Peña, a series producer and professor of Asian American studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, had the monumental task of deciding how to fit
decades of history into just five hours. She began with the arrival of Chinese railroad workers in the 1800s.
“We start at a time where we can still find people, if they’re descendants, with pictures and photographs,” Tajima-Peña said. “On the one hand, there was choosing which stories
we felt were most important to tell. On the other hand, it’s TV. We have to make sure it’s something that’s watchable and the audience can engage with.”
The series covers well-known events like the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, the World War II internment of Japanese Americans and the 1982 beating death of Vincent Chin in
Detroit.
But it also delves into lesser-known moments, like a 1965 labor strike organized by Filipino farmworkers in California, and spotlights people you may not recognize, like Patsy
Mink, a Japanese American who in 1964 was the first woman of color elected to Congress.
There's also an interview with Tereza Lee, who inspired the now-stalled DREAM Act that would have given a path to citizenship for young people brought to the U.S. illegally as
children.
Comedian Hari Kondabolu, known for his documentary “The Problem With Apu,” speaks in the series about post-9/11 treatment of Muslim Americans and Southeast Asian
Americans. The coronavirus-related racism has drawn comparison to that time.
Like Kondabolu did in 2001, many young Asian Americans are now facing outright hate for the first time.
“I had never been targeted the way I had been in 9/11. That shaped how I viewed this country,” he said at a virtual town hall last week. ""The generation after 9/11 ... they’re
gonna have to question where we are now. It’s going to inform how they will see the world.”
He's glad that the challenges and prejudices Asian Americans have faced for more than a century are enshrined in a documentary.
“Once it’s on PBS, it feels like an official document,"" Kondabalu said in an earlier interview. “This marks our place in the history of this country. It wasn’t there before.”

For the first time in my life, I fear walking outside or riding the subway. Not because of the coronavirus, but because I'm Asian.
More than 650 racist incidents were reported to the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, a coalition of community-based groups in Los Angeles, in just one week in March. A
man hit a Forest Hills dad in front of his son at a bus stop while yelling, ""You [expletive] Chinese!"" and another man stabbed an entire family at a Texas grocery store. In
Midtown, a woman punched a 23-year-old Korean student, yelling, ""You've got coronavirus, you Asian [expletive]!"" and the student went to Bellevue Hospital for possible jaw
dislocation. A friend in one of my classes was walking recently in Manhattan when some people yelled ""Yuck!"" and ""Get out of here!"" As a Korean-American medical student in
Manhattan, that could have been me.
On Tuesday, Ipsos released a survey for the Center for Public Integrity with alarming findings: 30% of Americans say they have seen someone blame Asians for the COVIID-19
pandemic, and 60% of Asians, who made up 6% of respondents, say they have seen the same behavior.
That is so different from when I came to the United States at age 6. Then, I hardly ever encountered racism. Instead, my teachers, who happened to be white, were supportive
and encouraging. My fifth-grade teacher in Baltimore even surprised me at graduation with a scholarship with some of her retirement funds, an act of kindness that moves me
to this day, and makes me dream of giving back as she did. In fact, the desire to give back has fueled my studies to become a doctor. But as an Asian-American medical student
watching COVID-19 unfold, I feel a sharp conflict in my identity because on one hand, Asian Americans are targeted, and on the other hand, medical professionals are regarded
as modern-day heroes. I am confused and discouraged by the outbreaks of racism in a country that has shown me openness and acceptance.
In a disaster like this one, people want to assign blame. For some, finding someone to blame can help make sense of the situation. Blame can also be an emotional response to
hold others responsible for our own resentment, indignation, or guilt. In the history of epidemics, this isn't the first time Asian Americans have faced hostility. During smallpox in
1876, a San Francisco health officer blamed ""unscrupulous, lying and treacherous Chinamen"" for their ""diabolical disregard of our sanitary laws,"" according to Nayan Shah,
author of ""Contagious Divides."" When bubonic plague hit the area in 1900, local health authorities planned to inject Chinese and Japanese people with a highly toxic
experimental vaccine. During SARS in 2003, people on the internet circulated emails warning to avoid Asian areas, causing New York City's Chinatown to experience dramatic
drops in business. In other epidemics, other immigrants have been scapegoats: Irish immigrants for typhoid and West Africans for Ebola. In this crisis, President Donald Trump
has repeatedly called COVID-19 ""Chinese virus"" as a way of blaming the disease on foreigners. This was even after the World Health Organization published best practices in
2015 stating ""disease names may NOT include"" geographic locations, learning from past unintended stigmatization.
Looking forward, my classmates and I are volunteering in a medical student task force assisting our front-line health care providers. Instead of directing attacks against our
Asian neighbors, let's focus on coming together to beat the virus. Let's move forward, and stop looking backward to attribute blame.

202103,"
BEIJING, May 27 (Xinhua) -- On the night of June 19, 1982, 27-year-old Chinese American Vincent Chin was beaten to death by two white auto workers in the U.S. city of
Detroit at a time when local politicians, union leaders and auto executives blamed Japan for the decline of the U.S. auto industry, and Chin was mistaken as a Japanese. 
Chin's tragedy, along with many other similar bloody incidents in the United States, has highlighted a dangerous bond between racist rhetoric and hate-crime violence. Sadly,
some Washington politicians have failed to learn a lesson from them and have in fact been feeding racism by spreading political viruses in the ferocious coronavirus pandemic. 
In the face of a deadly virus, saving lives and containing the outbreak ought to be the top priorities. Yet the decision-makers in the White House have squandered their
executive time on smearing China and fueling anti-Chinese sentiments with a carefully crafted political narrative. 
Those Washington China-hardliners, most notably U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, have raced to use every possible chance
to link the disease and the dire situation in the United States with China. In a recent ABC TV show, Navarro peddled his new conspiracy theory that China used air travels to
""seed"" the virus around the world. 
Other senior U.S. politicians like U.S. Senator for Texas John Cornyn have also joined the China-bashing binge, seeking to pin the blame of the outbreak on what they claimed ""a
culture where people eat bats and snakes and dogs and things like that"" in China. 
As a result of their racist propaganda, they have successfully ""made America hate again,"" and the hate-crime violence against Chinese and other Asian Americans has spiked
across the United States. In California, a 16-year-old boy was beaten up in a high school and sent to the emergency room of a nearby hospital. In New York, a 39-year-old
woman had acid thrown in her face outside her home. In Texas, a family of three, including children aged 2 and 6, were stabbed at a local Sam's Club. 
An Ipsos poll in April finds that over 30 percent of Americans have witnessed COVID-19 bias against Asians. The STOP AAPI HATE reporting center, tasked to track coronavirus
discrimination-related cases, has received 1,710 incident reports from Asian Americans across the country since mid-March. 
As of now, the coronavirus has infected more than 1.6 million and killed nearly 100,000 in the United States. At a time when solidarity should be valued more than ever to bear
down the pandemic, Washington's disinformation campaign can only foment animosity, tear up social fabric, and further worsen the racial divide in the country. 
In fact, such racist talk has already made America's own pandemic fight more arduous. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Asian Americans represent 6 percent of
the U.S. population, but 18 percent of the country's physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners. Rampant racism has put these life savers in harm's way as some are
shunned by patients, while others are facing increasing verbal harassment or even physical assaults at work. 
Because of rising racist sentiments, economic reopening in the United States has also become tougher. As Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross said in late January, Asian
American-owned businesses have been playing a key role in the U.S. economy, employing 3.6 million Americans and contributing over 700 billion U.S. dollars annually to
America's gross domestic product. However, discrimination and hate have now started to lead people away from these businesses. That will give a body blow to the U.S.
economy. 
""We must act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against the virus of hate,"" United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, calling on political leaders
""to show solidarity with all members of their societies and build and reinforce social cohesion."" 
Those Washington politicians should heed this call, stay away from racism in the fight against humanity's common enemy, and avoid creating more hate-crime victims like
Vincent Chin. Making America hate will only make America suffer.

202103,"
A joint statement released on May 25 calls for solidarity against hate and racism against Asian communities in the US. The statement is signed by more than 100 prominent
writers, artists, actors, and creative professionals. Many of them are Americans with Asian origins. 
The statement is followed by a day-long event of online panel discussions hosted by Pen America and Asian American Writers’ Workshops on May 27. Panelists including college
professors, writers and journalists drew attention on hostility mindset and behaviors after the COVID-19 pandemic, asking people to “speak out and fight hate”. 
The statement refers to a report released by ADL, an organization watch for bias, discrimination and hate around the world. The report listed more than 100 anti-Asian incidents
reported in the media and by victims since January. The attacks have happened in college campuses, city subways and online. Many individuals being spit on, stabbed, beat up,
or verbally assaulted.
One incident reported by the Daily Beast is that a man from Myanmar and his two children, ages six and two, were attacked and stabbed at a Sam’s Club by a 19-year-old man
in Texas on March 14. The alleged assailant admitted to targeting the family because he believed the family was Chinese and infecting people with coronavirus. 
ADL points out that the list is still not comprehensive, but it is clear that these are not just isolated incidents. The anti-Asian sentiment is on rise, in both scale and quantity. 
According to a recent Ipsos poll among Americans, 32% of them have witnessed someone blaming Asian people for COVID-19 and 24% would be concerned about coming in
close contact with someone of Asian origins. With such an alarming proportion, things could be out of control if unchecked. 
“They have been egged on at times by an administration drawing on racist tropes and stereotypes, eager to distract from its own missteps,” claims the statement. It highlights
that public officials and leaders in the US have not taken sufficient steps to address such attacks, and in some cases are promoting theories that blame Asian people for the
coronavirus pandemic. 
“We, the undersigned, call on everyday citizens to join us in standing in solidarity with all those targeted by hate during COVID-19,” said the statement, “The time to turn back
this wave of hate is now.”

202103,"
Ignorance may be bliss in some situations, but a lack of knowledge during a pandemic can lead to social stigma from those ascribing blame or risk of infection, say
Asian Americans and people who have tested positive for COVID-19.
Stigma may take the form of social avoidance or rejection, gossip, physical violence or denial of service for health care, education, housing and employment. When
the new coronavirus reached the United States, there were reports of Asian Americans being targeted nationwide in verbal and physical attacks linked to fears of
COVID-19.
Marian Lien, president of the Pittsburgh chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans, said that the incidence of local stigma has ""very much increased"" since
early March, when local Asian American-owned restaurants and other establishments reported their business was down as much as 40%.
""There has been verbal harassment, which ranges from expletives to emphasizing 'Asians don't belong here,'"" she said. ""Whereas these kinds of bigoted comments
were common enough, now there is an added layer of threat - a raised fist, a threatening look, spitting - all reinforcing the conditional way Asian Americans have
been accepted in this country.""
Anyone of East Asian descent could become a scapegoat, Ms. Lien said.
""I think the fear, anxiety and increasing anger at stay-at-home orders and the experience of more and more job loss and financial insecurity is landing as a gut punch
to the community easiest to scapegoat for these frustrations.""
People who have contracted COVID-19 are also at risk. Kristen Linfante, of Mt. Lebanon, said she was talking to her mail carrier on April 30. She was wearing a face
mask and mentioned that she'd had the virus in March and had recovered. The next day, she said, someone from the Castle Shannon-Mt. Lebanon post office called
to say she would no longer be getting her mail delivered. She called the office and talked to a supervisor, who told her that she would have to send someone to pick
up her mail at the post office from now on because of the virus, she said.
""I offered to show them my test results. He was having none of that.""
She made numerous calls to try to resolve the situation, including to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. On May 1, she said, the supervisor called her back and said her
mail would be delivered. He did not provide an explanation for the change.
Because it is relatively early in the outbreak, data has yet to be collected by social scientists to determine how widespread COVID-19-related stigma is, but the World
Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the Pennsylvania Health Department are so concerned that all have issued guidance on how
to address and prevent it.
""We are certainly concerned about the potential for social stigma from COVID-19,"" said Nate Wardle, state Health Department press secretary. ""From the first cases
in the United States, we were worried about potential stigmatization of people of Asian descent. But as we have seen [COVID-19] cases here in Pennsylvania, those
concerns have increased to include anyone who tests positive, but also those in areas particularly affected, such as minority groups who work in life-sustaining jobs.
""The Wolf administration is working to ensure that communities do not feel threatened or at-risk because of COVID-19. This is already a difficult time for so many
people, and we need all Pennsylvanians to be understanding of another. There are many people who are struggling with their health, struggling mentally, struggling
financially, and we must be aware of that.""

SAN LEANDRO, Calif. -- A woman in the San Francisco Bay Area has been arrested on suspicion of posting handwritten messages at several homes, targeting Asian Americans
and suggesting that those not native to the United States should leave the country immediately.
Police in San Leandro, a suburb of 89,000 just south of Oakland, said officers were called to the Heron Bay neighborhood Friday evening after receiving reports of notes
containing ""insensitive messages towards minorities"" taped to five homes.
""If you are a woman or man and was born in other country, return, go back to your land immediately, fast, with urgency,"" the note said. It ended with ""One American, white,
brave, that serves the Nation or USA is going to live here.""
Gu
One resident gave the officers images captured on his doorbell security camera of a woman taping the note, and the officers soon found her in the area, police said in a
statement.
Nancy Arechiga, 52, was carrying a backpack containing copies of the same notes, the statement said. She was arrested ""for these inappropriate messages that instilled fear
and intimidation upon those residents.""
""We welcome people's rights to express themselves, but not in a manner that infringes upon a community's sense of security and well-being,"" Lt. Isaac Benabou said.
Arechiga was taken to Alameda County jail and booked for investigation of committing a hate crime. She was issued a citation and released from custody, another police official,
Lt. Ted Henderson, said.
California has set bail at $0 for low-level crimes and misdemeanors in an effort to keep jails empty during the covid-19 pandemic.
Arechiga was told to appear in court, though the date hasn't been set because of the holiday weekend, he said.
It wasn't known whether she has retained a lawyer. A phone number listed for Arechiga has been disconnected.
Police were also investigating whether Arechiga was responsible for a similar note found Thursday on a local trail. The note partially read, ""no Asians allowed, leave
immediately.""
An Asian-American woman told KGO-TV her family was shaken after finding a similar note posted on a tree trunk in the neighborhood. The woman, who asked not to be named
for safety concerns, said ""reading this letter sends chills down my spine.""
""Obviously there's been a spike in attacks against the Asian American community due to this pandemic,"" she said. ""It's sad to see that.""

Earlier this year, Jason Chen  Weiping was left speechless when an older student at school in New York taunted him with a video of a Chinese woman eating bat soup.
""He said that Asians were freaks, that they caused the  coronavirus. I didn't know how to respond. I felt he was justified for what he was saying because he had the video,""
recalls the 16-year-old, who was born in Taishan, Guangdong province, and emigrated to the US with his mother when he was a baby.
Jason has since discovered that the video was filmed three years ago in Palau, Micronesia - not in China.
Cases of harassment and bullying of Asian-Americans have surged in the United States since the coronavirus began spreading there, months after the first cluster of Covid-19
cases was reported in Wuhan in late December. This new wave of racism has inspired non-profit organisation Apex for Youth to take a stand.
The group organises workshops and mentoring for school-age Asian-Americans from disadvantaged backgrounds in New York.
Even before the pandemic broke out, more than half of Asian-American students in the US said they had been bullied at school - which is more than any other ethnic group,
says Jiyoon Mary Chung, interim executive director of Apex.
Apex recently surveyed 100 students on the social effects of the pandemic. Half the respondents expressed concern or anxiety about anti-Asian discrimination, and 15 per cent
said they had directly experienced racism. Also, 40 per cent of respondents reported that their families had been affected financially by the virus outbreak.
""They hear things like, Chinese people are dirty or disgusting, or their own president calling the virus a 'Chinese virus',"" Chung says. ""When this happens, what do you say
back? Or is the person worth your time? We encourage the students to stay connected with their mentors to talk about their feelings and get practical suggestions on what to
do.""
If bullying is conducted online, for example, Apex suggests young people should unfollow and report the bully or speak out. If someone is being taunted in person, a bystander
could stand beside them for moral support or help the victim leave the scene. If they feel comfortable, they could speak out - but focus on the idea or behaviour, not the
instigator of the attack.
Apex also encourages young people to point out that the coronavirus pandemic has nothing to do with ethnicity, or, if they know the person, engage in a conversation, Chung
says. They are also  encouraged to take care of themselves by exercising regularly, meditating, or finding a creative outlet through which to channel their emotions.
Apex has worked with thousands of students of Chinese, Korean, Japanese and South Asian descent since it was founded in New York in 1992 by dentist Alex Tsui and four of his
Asian-American friends. Their aim was to help families from similar ethnic and cultural backgrounds to theirs.
Apex mentors are carefully chosen in a rigorous process that includes several interviews; Jason's mentor, 28-year-old Elvin Yuen, says it took at least six months for him to be
accepted. All mentors are trained and then matched with young people with similar backgrounds, interests and goals.
Yuen, a banker who was born in Hong Kong and grew up in Manhattan, says Jason was upset by the bat soup video incident, which happened before the city was locked down.
""He fell silent because he didn't know what to say about the woman eating bat soup,"" Yuen says. ""These things are happening, but we have to stay educated and try to defuse
the  situation.""
Jason, who says he has experienced racism from an early age, later suggested that Apex run workshops to specifically address bullying fuelled by the pandemic.
""I grew up in Spanish Harlem, where there are different minorities. People would make slitty eyes or say 'Ching Chong' at me,"" Jason recalls. ""When I went into kindergarten, I
only knew like three words in English, and so when I said something in Chinese everyone looked at me weird.""

I am a fan of Bryan Adams, Donald Trump, not so much. Both men have recently said something impolitic that led to accusations of racism.
In both instances, some people may have been a tad too sensitive about minor offences when there is actually real violent racism against Asians in Western countries because
of the coronavirus pandemic.
In the case of the Canadian rocker, I actually agree with what he said, though as a public figure, he might have made the same point with less extreme language. He has since
apologised.
Originally, on Instagram, he said: ""[T]hanks to some (expletive) bat eating, wet market animal selling, virus making greedy b******s, the whole world is now on hold.
My message to them other than ""thanks a (expletive) lot"" is go vegan."" Racist? Not at all. It's actually kind of true.
However, he should know that the Chinese government has now banned the trading and consumption of wildlife animals. It remains to be seen how successful Chinese
enforcement of the new law will be.
Also, at least two Chinese cities - Zhuhai and Shenzhen - have banned the eating of cats and dogs. Hopefully, others will follow.
While I admire vegans, who refuse to eat any animal products at all, vegetarianism may be a less radical option for most people, as it allows them to eat dairy and eggs.
As for the US president, there is abundant evidence that he is a racist and a sexist. But that doesn't mean everything he says about non-whites and women are such.
When an Asian-American CBS reporter asked him about the death toll of the pandemic in the United States, he replied, ""Ask China."" Trump has been blaming China for months
now, and that was the intention of his reply.
Somehow, the reporter was offended, thinking what he said had to do with her looking Asian. Quite a few others agreed with her.
On the great scale of things, having your question deflected by a racially insensitive president is rather minor compared to real racism.
While hard statistics are unavailable, a survey by the Asian-American Studies department at San Francisco State University found a 50 per cent increase in news stories about
coronavirus-related discrimination and violent incidents from early February to early March in the US.
Fussing over minor incidents distracts people from the real problems that many Asians suffer on the basis of their race because of the pandemic.

Dakota Holmes says she was walking her dog, Kato, through Gray's Park on Vancouver's  Eastside at about 8.30pm on  Friday when she sneezed.
She said she had just passed a man, who wheeled around and began berating her about  Covid-19, yelling at her to ""go back to China"". As the abuse  escalated - ""very negative
comments [about] the coronavirus … go home, you don't belong here"" - the man punched her in the head twice, knocking her to the ground.
Holmes, 27, is an indigenous Canadian.
""I've been in situations like this before, being indigenous,"" Holmes said. ""I try not to get  involved. I try not to say anything back … I think the only thing I said was 'I'm not
Asian, I'm indigenous, I'm from here, I've been here my whole life'.""
Holmes' experience is not unique.
In Montreal, Inuit  woman Sue Simigak said she was abused on the city's subway on April 4 by a man who similarly mistook her for being Chinese and told her to ""get out of my
own country"". She  posted pictures on Facebook showing a man giving her the  finger from a subway  platform.
Anti-racism activist Fo Niemi said indigenous people in  Canada, particularly the Inuit, were often mistaken for Asians ""due to their physical features"".
The cases of Holmes and  Simigak showed how racism could spread amid the pandemic, said Niemi, co-founder and exe cutive director of the Montreal-based Centre for Research
Action on Race Relations.
""Rising incidents and reports of anti-Asian racism and xenophobia can spread to other groups in Canada who look Asian,  ranging from Inuit people to Latin Americans,"" Niemi
said.
Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs, issued a statement in response to the attack on Holmes, who works at the organisation.
It said the union was  ""disgusted"" by the incident and offered ""sympathy and solidarity to Asian communities who have borne the brunt of Covid-19  related racism"".
Holmes' case was being  handled by the Vancouver  Police  Department's hate crimes  investigators, spokesman  Sergeant Aaron Roed said.
""Our initial investigation shows that a person was assaulted and this may have been related to race … the victim did have  minor physical injuries and did not need medical
treatment the night of the incident,"" Roed said.
No arrests have been made, and police were seeking witnesses to the incident, Roed said. Holmes said her attacker was a Caucasian man, about 180cm tall and  weighing about
90kg,  wearing a hat and a dark jumper.
She said the man had passed her from the opposite direction and was about two metres behind her when she sneezed because of her seasonal allergies. He immediately started
shouting abuse.
""When I turned around to face him, he started coming at me,  yelling in my face and then he punched me, in the jaw, and then above my eye, my temple area,"" she said.
Holmes said she fell to the ground, but felt she was saved from worse by Kato, a 45kg Dogo Argentino that Holmes adopted three years ago. Kato started  biting at the man's
ankles.
The man responded by  threatening to have authorities confiscate Kato because the dog was ""being aggressive"". With Kato straining at the end of his leash, the man eventually
ran off.
Holmes returned to her nearby home and called her father, Don Bain - a special adviser to British Columbia Premier John Horgan - who calmed her down. An hour later she
called the police and met them back at the park.
Niemi said a wave of anti-Asian racism linked to the coronavirus had caught many places unprepared.

Chinese Canadian actor Simu Liu is deeply proud of his heritage and likes to champion it whenever he can.
But the discrimination, racism and xenophobia that's been aimed at the Asian community during the COVID-19 crisis has put a damper on such spirits.
The star of CBC's ""Kim's Convenience"" and Marvel's upcoming film ""Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings"" says he's heard from countless people who have experienced
such discrimination and he's faced it himself during the pandemic.
He's hoping to shift the narrative by celebrating Asian and South Asian Heritage Month this month - and spotlighting the works of notable Asian Canadians - on social media as a
new ambassador for Made / Nous, a movement recognizing creative Canadian talent.
Also taking part in the campaign is Tamil-Canadian actress Maitreyi Ramakrishnan, star of Mindy Kaling's new Netflix series ""Never Have I Ever.""
""I think it is especially important now in this day and age, at this time where anti-Asian sentiment and xenophobia is higher than it's ever been in a very long time - and I don't
think you can argue that,"" Liu said in a recent phone interview from Sydney, where he was filming ""Shang-Chi"" until the pandemic halted production. His role as the kung-fu
master makes him Marvel's first big-screen Asian American superhero.
""Every day, I see more instances of hate crimes and discrimination, not only in Canada but the U.S. and Australia, where I'm at. There have been a lot of cases of people getting
spat on in the street, verbally abused, physically abused. It's really easy to be weighed down by all of this hate that's brewing in the world.""
Liu, who immigrated to Canada from northern China at age five, and grew up in Etobicoke and Mississauga, said he felt such discrimination first-hand when he was recently
walking out of a restaurant in Sydney before the pandemic lockdown came into full force.
""I had a piece of food in my throat and I was trying to get it out, and was coughing and hacking a little bit,"" he said. ""And this white guy comes out of a restaurant with a
woman and looks over at me and, without even thinking about it, he just says ""Coronavirus"" and chuckles to himself and keeps walking.
""I was honestly so shocked in that moment that I didn't even know how to react. And I did just kind of brush it off ... But it's just a taste of what is going on in the world right
now and what collectively people are thinking.""
Liu added: ""I feel like if you're an Asian person in the world in 2020, you're fighting a virus on two fronts. We are, like every single other person in this world, at the mercy of
this COVID thing. And then we're also at the same time fighting this virus of hate that has apparently spread and infected just as many people, if not more.""
The 31-year-old graduate of the Ivey School of Business at Western University said he stayed in Sydney once production on ""Shang-Chi"" was halted partly because ""Australia is
in very good shape compared to a lot of other countries in the world"" when it comes to COVID-19. And there was a risk of contracting the disease through travel.
He celebrated his birthday last month by asking his social media followers to donate to either the Trillium Health Partners hospital system in Mississauga or a health network of
their choice.
The initiative raised more than $10,000, Liu said, noting he matched that figure himself in a donation spread among different hospitals and non-profits.
His advice for those facing racism at this time is ""not to buy into this 'go-back-to-where-you-came-from, you-don't-belong-here' kind of mentality and rhetoric that is being
propagated by some top politicians.""
""You belong exactly where you are, and you deserve to stand on your own two feet and hold your head high no matter what,"" he said.
""Call it out when you see it and then reach out if you ever feel like you need somebody to talk to, because I think the aim with a lot of these angry people is to make us feel
alone and isolated.""
Liu said he's happy to hear from those who want to reach out to him on social media. And he noted that hate crimes can also be reported to authorities.

Trump Asian Reporter.png
President Trump has certainly made some racist comments during his time in politics. But his abrupt dismissal of CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang at Monday evening’s press
conference isn’t one of them. Of course, that didn’t stop liberal journalists en masse from trying to make the story themselves, baselessly crying racism for the billionth time. As
always, they fail to appreciate that they are diluting the charge for whenever it is actually warranted.
Here’s the exchange that prompted so much outcry.
Jiang asked Trump an antagonistic question, as is her right, demanding that he explain why he views coronavirus testing as a “global competition” and questioning his motives
while “everyday Americans are losing their lives.”
Trump responded, “Well, they’re losing their lives everywhere in the world. And maybe that’s a question you should ask China. Don’t ask me. Ask China that question. … You
may get a very unusual answer.”
Then, Trump tried to move on, but Jiang interjected again and asked, “Sir, why are you saying that to me, specifically?” The reporter’s follow-up question and intonation were
clearly meant to accuse the president of racism, as she is an Asian American. Apparently, the thought didn’t cross her mind that Trump may have said that to her “specifically”
because she was the one who asked him the question.
“I’m not saying it specifically to anybody. … I’m saying it to anyone that would ask a nasty question like that,” Trump replied. A bit more discord ensued, and when the gaggle of
reporters wouldn’t move on, Trump abruptly ended the press conference and stormed out.
You can watch the full exchange for yourself below:Trump Press Conference
Naturally, liberal journalists decided to take an incident that otherwise may have reflected on the president somewhat poorly merely for his lack of decorum and suffer an
unhinged meltdown trying without basis to make Trump’s deflection a racist attack on an Asian American journalist.
CNN’s Brian Stelter immediately cried racism, saying shortly after this incident, on-air, that “what we saw in that exchange with Weijia Jiang was something that has racial
overtones. It's racist to look at an Asian American White House correspondent and say, 'Ask China.'” He was one of many left-wing journalists to jump to this charge, with his
CNN colleague Wolf Blitzer calling the president’s behavior “very ugly.”
And here’s just a small sample of the truly unhinged pity party that quickly descended on left-wing social media, as #WeijiaJiang trended:TweetTweetTweetTweet
Trump has been laying blame for the coronavirus pandemic on China and on its regime since day one of the crisis. Rightly or wrongly, he has time and time again deflected
criticism of his administration’s decision-making by pivoting to China. All he did this time was do this once again in response to essentially the same question as always — but
this time coming from an Asian American reporter.
No one deserves to be demeaned or insulted for his or her race or ethnicity. Trump did not do this to Jiang, and the reaction to this has been utterly ridiculous.
UPDATE: This story has been corrected to reflect that CNN's Wolf Blitzer, not CNN's Oliver Darcy, called the president's behavior ""very ugly.""

Asian-Australians have reported almost 400 racist attacks since the beginning of April to the country's leading survey of
anti-China racism.
The figures prompted calls for the federal government to track racism better as federal MPs accused the Chinese
government of spreading divisive propaganda when on Saturday it encouraged its citizens to avoid travelling to
Australia due to a ""significant increase"" in racial discrimination amid coronavirus.
Osmond Chiu, a fellow at independent progressive think tank Per Capita, authored the survey in collaboration with the
Asian Australian Alliance and Being Asian Australian. ""There definitely has been an increase,"" he said, noting that
compared to similar data from the United States there has been a higher proportion of racist incidents against Asian-
Australians than Asian-Americans.
The survey, which started on April 2 and will be completed this month, has so far documented 386 racist incidents,
including abuse, physical intimidation and spitting.
The survey also revealed that roughly 90 per cent of racist incidents were not being reported to police and the vast
majority were perpetrated by strangers in public.
Mr Chiu called on the federal government to improve what he said was a disjointed incident reporting process,
potentially through the Human Rights Commission.

In a personal essay, DW's Beina Xu reflects on a coronavirus-related racist attack and confronts Europe's deeply problematic idea of race.
I hadn't seen him coming. The man was short, stocky, roughly my father's age. Suddenly he was standing before me as I sat having a drink on a
bench. He pointed at the face mask crumpled in his other fist.
""This is shit,"" he informed me. I blinked out of confusion.
""Corona comes from China,"" he clarified. ""It's shit, what you brought here.""
My first thought was the image on the cover of German news magazine Der Spiegel, in late January. It was a photo of an Asian person in a red
hazmat suit, captioned with an alarming yellow font ""Made in China: When Globalization Becomes a Deadly Threat.
I stared at the man. He seemed like a meek, ordinary retiree. I tried to see what he saw in me-and I could, because I'd ingested those same images
my whole life. Looking at my face is to look at centuries of Eastern bodies in the white imagination: the silent, ""almond-eyed masseuse; the
replicated worker manufacturing replicas; the sun-dried slave born in a bamboo forest, who built your railroads but will nonetheless steal your social
security. There's the buck-toothed cook, and small-footed prostitute.
Faces like mine have freakishly adorned magazines, movies, books, and posters since Marco Polo galloped home in the 13th century. As an Asian
woman who spent her life in the West, I can assure you that the pain of understanding yourself through the gaze of whites is double-edged: it kills
you, then shows you how to survive.
But the title of pandemic creator was a first. Racism is dynamic; it morphs to fit political expediency. And it is exposing a harrowing crack in the
European project. Amidst the global reckoning about race ignited by the death of George Floyd, I want to make one thing clear: that Western
Europe touts a vile relativism when it comes to facing its own racism. It points its finger at the US as if to say, we're not as bad as that.
I'd like to remind them, in my red hazmat suit, of just one detail: that the adolescent nation internally combusting from racial pain was the
brainchild of European colonialism. That is to say: it is, and always was, a project founded on the vision of white supremacy.
A matter of bad manners
Let's address the curiosity before it gets in the way: I am Chinese. I grew up in the US, studied in Europe, and have been living in Berlin for six
years. It goes without saying that the racism I endure in the West is persistent, quotidian, and mind-numbingly unoriginal. But because I am not
getting knifed by Nazis, most Germans diminish my experiences to a matter of bad manners by bad people.
""He's just a racist nut,"" a German friend said of the vitriolic pensioner (as if that were ever a source of comfort.) ""Most people aren't like that.""
When she said ""most people,"" I didn't know if she included her own sister, who imitated the Chinese language in front of me at the dinner table. (A
resounding performance akin to, as the old joke goes, throwing a fork down the stairs.) Or my former water polo coach, who referred to the slits in

Since mid-March, a U.S.-based coalition has tracked more than 2,100 anti-Asian hate incidents, a troubling figure that Asian American advocates say is being fueled
in part by political rhetoric against China during the coronavirus pandemic.
While racial slurs and other forms of verbal harassment constituted the vast majority of the incidents, nearly eight percent involved physical assaults, businesses
barring Asian Americans from entering their establishments due to misplaced coronavirus fears, and attackers coughing and spitting on victims, according to STOP
AAPI Hate, an anti-Asian hate tracker.
In one incident in March, a group of African American teenagers on a commuter rail in San Francisco used their backpacks to attack a mask-wearing Asian
American, saying he had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.
Chinese Americans raise funds for medical supplies despite rising racial threats
In another occurrence in April, a stranger threw a large rock through the atrium window of a Chinese American family's house in Santa Rosa, California. The house
had Chinese writing along the front door as a blessing for good health and harmony.
These are first-hand accounts where individuals are describing harrowing and traumatizing experiences, including what is being said to them when they're being
attacked, said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, one of the coalition partners.
Asian Americans have been targeted before during public health crises, as was the case during the 2003 SARS epidemic. The latest wave of anti-Asian hate comes
at a time of heightened tensions over the pandemic fueled by the anti-China rhetoric of President Donald Trump and other politicians. Trump, who initially praised
China for its handling of the crisis, subsequently blamed China's leader Xi Jinping for waiting weeks to report the outbreak in Wuhan to the World Health
Organization and covering up the severity of the problem.
Trump has repeatedly referred to the coronavirus as the Chinese virus and kung-flu, terms that Asian American advocates say are derogatory and have exacerbated
the scapegoating of Americans of Asian descent.
Trump disputes that those and other terms are racist. White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who several weeks ago criticized the phrase kung-flu as highly
offensive, and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany both said this week that the president used the term merely to highlight that the virus originated in China.
But Asian American leaders say the meaning is not lost on their fast-growing community.
Those are terms meant to be humiliating, said Gene Wu, a Chinese American Democratic member of the Texas House of Representatives.
Bill Ting, a Democratic state assemblyman in California, said the rhetoric has had a direct impact on the surge in anti-Asian harassment and hate crimes.
You see leaders express words that really give license to other people to express those same sentiments and also to act on them, Tung said.
In a recent report examining the link between political rhetoric and anti-Asian bias, STOP AAPI Hate, the Asian American coalition, found that reports of anti-Asian
discrimination spiked after Trump repeatedly used the term Chinese virus.
While the vast majority of the 2,100-plus incidents recorded by STOP AAPI Hate do not rise to the level of a hate crime as defined by statute, more than 100 do,
according to legal experts.
The FBI reports there has been an uptick in hate crimes and harassment against Asian Americans since the outbreak of COVID-19, which first appeared in Wuhan,
China, late last year

In light of the recent murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, and the numerous murders of black people by a white supremacist system, the Asian Pacific Islander Civic
Action Network of Massachusetts (APIs CAN!) stands firmly with the black communities of this country. We call on each and every member of our AAPI community to stand up
for black lives.
Our AAPI community has suffered recently from economic losses and anti-Asian racism as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. We know that under white supremacy, this
violence is inextricable from the danger that black people face every day while jogging, sitting at home or just going about their everyday lives, from both the police and
rightwing vigilantism. Any encounter with the police could turn deadly, and this long history of oppression of black people dates back centuries. Statistics show that a black
person is killed by the police every twenty-eight hours. As immigrants and refugees and their children in this country, we inherit this ugly legacy, whether we want to or not.
Across the country, many of the businesses that were damaged or destroyed are owned by people of color and immigrants, including Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, and
many are black-owned as well. We express our sadness and sympathy for these business owners, many of whom have suffered tremendously due to the pandemic. However, we
stand firmly with millions of peaceful protesters standing against police brutality, calling for justice for George Floyd and demanding a transformation of the system that
murders, dehumanizes and systematically oppresses black people. We reject any attempt to pit the AAPI community against black communities. We cannot confront anti-Asian
American racism without acknowledging and directly working against racism toward black communities.
As part of this, we must examine our own prejudices and deal with anti-black racism within our own community. One of the officers who stood by during George Floyd's killing
was Tou Thao, an Asian American. Our community must speak unequivocally in solidarity with black communities to demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Tony
McDade, and so many others.
There is a history of Asian Americans being labelled the ""model minority"" in order to pit us against black communities and other people of color that dates back several decades.
For this reason, it is particularly important for us to take a clear stand for justice with black communities in this moment.
In fact, our communities have a long history of solidarity. It was the black-led Civil Rights and Black Power movements that paved the way for Asian Americans to gain increased
access to education and employment, to challenge language-based discrimination, and for liberalization of immigration in 1965. When Asian people, like Long Guang Huang and
the Quincy Four, were targets of police violence, the black community has always stood with us in demanding accountability. In Massachusetts, we've stood together to demand
that construction sites be opened to workers of color, that teaching staff in the public schools reflect the cultures of our children, and that political districts be drawn to increase
each community's opportunity for representation.
We commit to supporting and following the lead of black-led organizing to demand justice for police brutality and murders of black lives, and toward changing systems that
perpetuate white supremacy. We will struggle sideby-side to transform these systems and build a better world.

Biases are forms of discrimination in which we hold unfair beliefs about an entire group of people. These biases can be conscious (explicit) or unconscious (implicit).
Business Insider spoke to Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, a doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, a researcher of implicit bias, to gain a greater
understanding of bias in medicine.
Both explicit and implicit bias are prevalent in the medical field, and they can affect how patients of different races, genders, faiths, and sexualities are treated.
Due in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to the CDC.
Though there has been great progress in reducing explicit biases, implicit biases are much harder to tackle, and they take active participation to identify and eliminate.
Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.
Biases are present in many human interactions. These typically unfair assumptions, which can encompass entire groups of people, affect how we feel about and treat members
of other races, genders, faiths, weights, sexualities, and abilities. In healthcare, the effect of biases on patients can lead to dangerous consequences.
Explicit biases, or conscious biases, are easier to detect because they are overt, according to Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, who co-authored Implicit bias in healthcare professionals: a
systematic review, which was published in BMC Medical Ethics.
""If someone had explicit bias, they might say, 'Oh, you know, obese people just don't work as hard, or they're lazy,'"" Dr. Fitzgerald told Business Insider. However, ""if it was
implicit, they might choose someone else over an obese person to do a task because they'll assume the obese person will be slower to do it,"" she said.
Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, who co-authored The Impact of Unconscious Bias in Healthcare: How to Recognize and Mitigate It in The Journal of Infectious Diseases, said a lower
presence of minorities in the medical field perpetuates bias.
Dr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Marcelin identified ways biases affect the healthcare industry.
Explicit bias against diverse groups has led to extreme abuse within the medical profession, like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted between 1932 and 1972.
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study was an experiment that spanned 40 years, starting in 1932. It involved 600 black men, 399 with syphilis, and 201 without the disease, to test the
effects of untreated syphilis. The study was carried out without their consent, as researchers told the men that they were being treated for ""bad blood,"" a term used to describe
several ailments, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. (In 1974, a $10 million settlement was reached out of court with the participants and their families, and in 1997,
President Bill Clinton apologized to them on behalf of the country.)
""The Tuskegee study demonstrated how conscious bias, in this case manifested in the form of racism, led to the unethical treatment of black men that continues to have long-
lasting effects on health equity and justice in today's society,"" Dr. Marcelin said.
Due in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to the CDC.
Dr. Fitzgerald said black women were historically abused by white doctors performing gynecological procedures on them without their consent. These doctors held the false
belief that black women somehow experienced less pain.
The field of infectious diseases is also affected by implicit bias, according to Dr. Marcelin.
She is passionate about reducing biases in the field of infectious disease.
""I definitely think from a pandemic standpoint there is a huge risk for minority groups who are affected. We have a lot of data that shows that the effects of systemic racism and
bias on minority groups has led to worse outcomes in those groups,"" she said.
Black people are 2.4 times more likely to die from the coronavirus.
Data from AMP Research Lab revealed that there were 54.5 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 in America's black population, while there were 22.7 per 100,000 for
America's white population.
Though these deaths can be attributed in part to the way systemic racism makes black people less likely to have access to healthy food, green spaces, and livable wages, they
could also be a result of the biases black people experience in healthcare.

202103,"
Recently, the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that along with physical distancing, wearing protective masks slows the spread of COVID-
19. Canada has made a similar announcement.
More than 50 countries now mandate wearing masks in public.
While primarily a protective measure, the COVID-19 mask has also become a cultural icon. In western nations it has become a marker of social responsibility and good
citizenship. It represents the wearer's compliance with public safety and communal well-being through exercising care for one's self and others.
During the 2003 SARS crisis, ""mask culture"" was seen as fostering a sense of mutual obligation and civic duty. Similarly in our current pandemic, wearing a protective
mask signifies a commitment to the social and collective good of society.
But how does that perception change when a face mask is worn by someone who is Asian? Or a Black man? Why do some jurisdictions outlaw the face veil or niqab
worn by some Muslim women while mandating protective masks? Through European colonialism whiteness became the standard against which all other bodies are
marked, judged and codified. American anti-racism educator Peggy MacIntosh argues that whiteness provides an ""invisible knapsack"" of unearned privileges that white
people can often take for granted.
These are basic things like: going shopping and not be followed or harassed; never being asked to speak for all white people; and not having to educate one's children
to be aware of systemic racism for their own daily physical protection.
The concept of white privilege can be related to how COVID-19 mask-wearing is seen differently when worn on racialized bodies.
For more than 100 years, Asians in North America have been represented as diseased foreigners and more recently blamed as ""pandemic starters.""
Rather than exemplifying a commitment to the public good, an abundance of pictures of Asian individuals wearing masks may have accelerated the circulation of
derogatory stereotypes. Research has shown Canadian Press photos related to the 2003 SARS crisis used Asians wearing masks as a dominant image. With COVID 19,
the trend of using masked Asian faces as the emblem of the crisis continues the trajectory of these racist depictions.
Instead of representing a good citizen helping to stop the spread of a possible contagion, a protective mask transforms Asian bodies into the source of contagion.
Trump's insistence in referring to COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus"" dangerously reinforced the racializing of this disease.
Anti-Asian hate crimes including physical and verbal assaults and vandalism have escalated along with the pandemic.
A recent report told a story of a woman in British Columbia who was accosted by two white men who yelled at her and her mother: ""Look at you with your masks,
you're what's wrong with society.""
The risk of such attacks and harassment confronts Asian diasporas with a difficult choice: wear a mask and risk being subjected to violence or do not and bear the risk
of contracting the virus.
A Black physician in Boston wrote about his internal struggle with wearing a mask in public because of the racist fears it evokes. He said: ""I wonder whether someone
would call the police on me, a 'suspicious'Black man in a face mask. I negotiate with myself whether risking my life is worth a $300 fine.""
He has reason to worry. A Black doctor in Miami wearing a surgical mask was handcuffed outside his home by police.
The killings of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd in the United States are tragic events that reveal the very real dangers Black people face on a daily basis. And yet in
early May, heavily armed, white protesters stormed the Michigan State capitol without incident.

A recent poll suggesting half of Chinese-Canadians have endured racial slurs since the COVID-19 pandemic began should be a wakeup for the country, says an Alberta human
rights activist.
The online survey of 516 Chinese-Canadians conducted June 15-18 also states 61% of its respondents had changed their daily routines in an effort to avoid backlash over the
deadly virus, which originated in China.
""My assistant is afraid to go to the grocery store,"" said Serena Mah, spokeswoman for the group ACT2endracism, which sprang up in response to what its organizers call a
recent spike in bigotry towards Asian-Canadians.
""There's a fear in the community it's going to escalate ... it's so heated out there.""
The poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute in partnership with the University of Alberta also found 43% of those surveyed felt threatened or intimidated since the pandemic
began more than three months ago and that nearly two-thirds believe North American news coverage fosters negative stereotypes about them.
Of the 57 members of her group's network, half have said they've experienced some form of racism over the past few months, said Mah, adding she's frustrated with the level
of denial among Canadians.
""We spend so much time trying to convince people racism exists,"" she said.
Mah said racist incidents are underreported by those who don't fully trust government or don't know how to go about it.
""My own mother wouldn't want to report it, she wouldn't want to be a burden on police.""
Some observers also cite as a factor anger towards China over that country's 18-month detention of Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor in what many believe is a
diplomatic dispute.
That hostility has led many Chinese-Canadians to feel they're not viewed as belonging, said human rights activist Teresa Woo-Paw.
Only 13% of the poll's respondents say they believe they're accepted as Canadians all the time.
""People continue to see Chinese-Canadians as foreigners but there's a great deal of diversity in the community and a lot of it doesn't agree with (Chinese government policy),""
said Woo-Paw, who emigrated from Hong Kong at the age of 13.
That climate of backlash, she said, has made her worried about even walking through her neighbourhood.
""It crosses my mind of what would I say if I encounter it,"" said Woo-Paw.
Both women say there's an absence of comprehensive data on racist incidents by higher levels of government that leave that task to those without proper resources.
""We're pressing the federal government and asking them, 'Why is it the community's responsibility when you need standardized data to establish trends,' "" said Mah.
Last month in Calgary there were several graffiti attacks singling out China and Chinese people over the spread of COVID-19, two of them targeting the Asian country's
consulate downtown.
But while such racism does exist in Calgary, it doesn't appear to be as prevalent here as in larger cities where police are investigating violent incidents targeting those of Asian
descent, said Terry Wong, executive director of the Chinatown Business Improvement Area.
His group canvassed several hundred Chinese-Canadians the past few weeks about the issue and didn't receive any reports of mistreatment, said Wong, who also assists city
police on diversity issues.
""That's not to say it's not happening, but it doesn't seem as overtly out there in Calgary society,"" said Wong.

202103,"
The number of complaints related to racial discrimination the human rights watchdog in New York City received from February to April was 20 times more than the same period
last year, among which nearly half were from Asian Americans.
That is only the tip of the iceberg, as Asian Americans nationwide have encountered a surge in discrimination and racism. Even some Asian American doctors and nurses
fighting against the COVID-19 pandemic on the front line in the US have been boycotted and insulted by patients.
For a long time, Asian Americans, particularly those successful, have been regarded as free riders of the US system, regardless of how hard they have worked to climb up the
social ladder. They have been subject to the spite of jealousy as well as the long-rooted racism in US society toward Asians.
But what makes the discrimination they face even more egregious now is that it is being fueled and orchestrated by the US administration.
Even the Federal Bureau of Investigation has warned the dramatic increase of crimes against Asian Americans is because some people in the US have bought the
administration's fabrication that the novel coronavirus is a Chinese threat.
It is no coincidence that after the US administration started referring to the novel coronavirus as the ""China virus"" in March violence against Asian Americans increased rapidly.
With many US officials unceasingly trying to portray China as the source of the troubles the US is experiencing, it is obvious that the US administration is willing to victimize
some of its own citizens if it thinks that will get its own head off the spike of voter anger.
Although its now customary assertions that it is beyond reproach may be swallowed without demur by its hardcore supporters, the administration's falling approval ratings
show that while it may be able to fool some of the people all of the time, many of its one-time adherents have now cottoned onto the fact that its divisive words and deeds are
simply self-serving.
The mounting death toll from the pandemic in the US is not because the pathogen has Chinese characteristics but because the US administration has proved fatally incapable
of responding to it. The anger displayed on the streets of US cities shows that not only do a lot of people want an end to the country's long history of racist killings, they also
want the administration to be held accountable for its deadly ham-fisted handling of the pandemic.
It is fair to say that it is the US administration that has single-handedly transformed the public health emergency into a systemic social, political and economic crisis for the
nation. That's quite an achievement. But not one to take any tweeted pride in.

NGOs rally round to ensure food deliveries to needy
Donald Hong, chairman of UA3, an NGO based in New York dedicated to serving the local Asian and Chinese population, painted a grim picture.
Speaking about a group of people living in the Chung Pak complex for senior citizens in Manhattan's Chinatown, he said, ""They have opened up every can they have in the
house, trying to stretch them for another day or two.""
Since mid-March, UA3 has teamed up with the Trader Joe's grocery store chain, other NGOs and city officials to provide badly-needed food to these people. Hong described the
supplies as a lifeline for the seniors.
""The problem they are facing is twofold. On the one hand, the seniors, who mostly have various ailments, are afraid to go out in case they become infected. On the other, they
are frightened by all the racism that has bubbled to the surface since the pandemic hit this country,"" Hong said.
At the height of the coronavirus outbreak in New York City in March and April, when the death toll peaked at more than 800 within 24 hours, everyone - caregivers, attendants
and even family members - stopped visiting the seniors.
Sam Wu, superintendent of the Chung Pak complex, said: ""The overwhelming majority of the more than 110 residents are in their 80s. We also have a handful of others in their
90s and a couple more who are over 100. Infirm, and sometimes immobile, they were cut off from food sources.""
Beatrice Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, another NGO based in New York, quickly responded to the challenges seniors faced.
She and her colleagues mobilized a group of volunteers, who ensured that bags of fresh produce were delivered to the homes of those badly in need.
Chen said that at the start of the outbreak everywhere was closing - ""the butcher's around the corner, nearby Chinese supermarkets, neighborhood Chinese restaurants, centers
for seniors and family associations"".
By mid-March even the pantries that catered to the city's poor had been closed. ""Some of them had still been serving meals. People went in and ate - that was obviously a large
gathering. Many more (pantries) simply could not find enough people to help handle and serve food safely,"" Chen said.
""We started to realize all the logistical implications if we were to open a standard pantry, where people line up to get their food. Standing in line for half an hour not only
exposes seniors to a greater risk of being infected, but also is physically and mentally exhausting,"" she added.
The Community First Food Pantry Program now delivers about 250 bags of groceries twice a week to the Chung Pak residents as well as others living in tenement buildings in
Chinatown and the Lower East Side, where there are huge populations of seniors.
Referring to city councilwoman Margaret Chin, the daughter of Chinese immigrant parents, Chen said, ""Donald Hong approached Margaret who, thanks to her constituent
services, really knows where these hard-to-reach people are.
""Every building has its own rules, and you cannot just drop off fresh produce that could rot and attract rats. We often have to go a day in advance to make sure that the tenants
will be at home when we deliver. One thing the seniors really miss is meat.""
Every morning, a Trader Joe's truck carrying food arrived in Lower Manhattan, and the supplies were unloaded at 2 am.
Hong said: ""Think about 50 crates of bananas and 340 crates of eggs. We seemed to be the only pantry in Lower Manhattan dealing with fresh, perishable food, as we wanted to
give people a familiar taste.""
All the food was sorted and stored at a 200-square-meter pantry owned by Chung Pak Local Development Corp, and previously occupied by a restaurant that closed due to the
pandemic.

Charles Lai, executive director of Chung Pak LDC, who helped found the Museum of Chinese in America in New York in 1980, said, ""Only by joining hands can we possibly reach
out to those who are in desperate need of help yet are hiding themselves out of fear.
""The damage our community has suffered, physically and economically, is much more severe than in most other communities. Why? Because we have a president who calls this
virus the Chinese virus, and in doing so has repeatedly evoked the country's (United States) racist history, making it unsafe for us at a time when all Americans need to stand
together.""
A report released by the New York Police Department shows that hate crimes and discrimination against Asian Americans have risen consistently in recent months. City officials
and local NGOs suspect that such incidents are underreported.
A paper issued by two NGOs - the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council and Chinese for Affirmative Action - said New York state has the second-highest number of cases of
discrimination related to COVID-19, after California.
Hong, citing examples of Asian Americans being physically and verbally attacked on the New York Subway, said: ""Before COVID-19, 40 percent of the people we served at our
Midtown pantry on 26th Street were Asian Americans. That proportion has dropped to below 10 percent, although we now have a line that stretches for three blocks. Members
of our community are not coming.""
Lai, the executive director, said: ""The impact of COVID-19 was palpably felt here even before it landed on American shores. Back in late January, when we were preparing to
celebrate Chinese New Year, people were already staying away from Chinatown and Chinese businesses. After the pandemic, Chinatown will be the last place that people choose
to return to.""
Business closures mean lost jobs, sometimes for an entire family, and it is not uncommon for different generations of Chinese American families in Manhattan's Chinatown to
run enterprises such as restaurants.
Early last month, CNN reported that about 147,000 Asian workers in New York state had filed for unemployment benefit in the past four weeks, a 6,900 percent rise over the
same period last year. The number of such filings by white workers rose by 1,840 percent and among black workers by 1,260 percent.
Chen, from Immigrant Social Services Inc, said: ""I know people who have started rationing food among three generations of a family. Waiting for unemployment benefit - which
takes months to apply for - and not knowing when they will get their jobs back, they are trying to make their food reserves last a bit longer.
""You don't really hear these stories, because they're not being told. People are also largely unaware of those who are being excluded from most federal, state and local funding
resources.""
Some 1,200 meals a week are now being provided by UA3, supported by Trader Joe's and other sources. In addition to caring for seniors, the NGO provides a home for the deaf
in New York and another building for the visually impaired.
Chi Loek, a UA3 board member, said: ""We are pushing to expand our services. Food insecurity is going to be with us not just for months, but for years, and will be compounded
by other factors, such as housing. What we are doing right now is intended not as an emergency measure, but as a sustainable, long-term solution to a problem that might
grow.""
With this in mind, UA3 last week moved its food pantry to Grand Street in Lower Manhattan, where it is expected to reach out to more people in need. The Chung Pak residents
continue to be served.
Kathleen Tom-Lew, a third-generation Chinese born and raised in Chinatown, has been working as a volunteer at the Chung Pak pantry since March, and makes deliveries in the
heart of Chinatown.
""Originally, we only wanted to serve the elderly, but then other tenants who were out of a job asked to be put on our list,"" said Tom-Lew, a co-founder of the New York nonprofit
Chinatown Community Young Lions.
Hong and Loek from UA3 scouted Chinatown and other areas of New York to find restaurants serving Chinese food that met the NGO's standards.
""These restaurants are funded by the city to provide ready-made meals for our program. While the seniors have something that is friendly on the stomach, the money is being
funneled to local Chinese businesses,"" he said.
Chen, reflecting on the situation in Chinatown since January, said: ""Citywide, we've never been considered a top priority when it comes to a time like this. Usually, there are
other neighborhoods that are much worse-off than ours, but this is different. It's unprecedented.""
The lives of local Chinese Americans, including active participants in community work, have been lost during the pandemic, including that of Jean Lau Chin, an avid collector of
oral histories in Chinatown.
Just two people from the Chung Pak complex - a 97-year-old woman and a 105-year-old man - have died since the outbreak, but neither from COVID-19.
According to an article in The New York Times in the middle of last month, one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the US had been reported among nursing home residents and
workers.
Wu, the superintendent, said: ""Since early March, we have provided masks to everyone entering the building, including caregivers and volunteers. If anyone leaves the building
and then re-enters, we give them a new mask. We also give them protective eyewear and thoroughly spray and disinfect everyone.""
Referring to the seniors, who have been told not to go outside, he said, ""We've gone out of our way to meet their needs and will continue to do so.""
Tom-Lew, who has been joined by her entire family in volunteering to help the elderly in Chinatown, spoke of the heart-warming response she has received.
""Officially, we are supposed to limit our contact only to those we are delivering to, for obvious reasons. But people wanted to thank us for our kindness by giving us something
in return, such as a water bottle. One lady, who is in her 70s and ethnically Chinese, even gave me packs of gum,"" she said.
""When the pandemic was raging in late March and early April, tenants would open the door slightly, allowing us to pass through the food bags. However, we often put the bags
outside on the floor, knocked on the door and then walked away.
""Before we left the floor, we could hear the squeaky sound of a door opening, followed by a shout down the hallway of 'thank you'.""

Pandemic Magnifies the Crisis of 'U.S.-Style Human Rights'."" Following is the full text:
The sudden and unexpected outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic is the most serious global public health
emergency that humanity has experienced since the end of World War II. It is also a ""big test of human rights
conditions"" for all countries across the globe. The virus does not respect borders, nor is race or nationality relevant
in the face of the disease. Given this, to honor our common commitment to human rights, governments of different
countries are obliged to adopt scientific measures for the prevention and control of the virus and do their best to
ensure the health and safety of their people. Nevertheless, the U.S. government's self-interested, short-sighted,
inefficient, and irresponsible response to the pandemic has not only caused the tragedy in which about 2 million
Americans became infected with the virus and more than 110,000 have died from it, but also caused the exposure
and deterioration of the long-existing problems within the United States, such as a divisive society, the polarization
between the rich and the poor, racial discrimination, and the inadequate protection of the rights and interests of
vulnerable groups. This has led the American people into grave human rights disasters.
1. The U.S. Government's Ineffective Response to the Pandemic Leading to Human Rights Disasters
Being distracted, slack, and opinionated in the face of the pandemic, the United States Federal Government
declared a national emergency on March 13, after tens of thousands of deaths had occurred. The pandemic
statistics released by Johns Hopkins University in the United States showed that as of June 9 Eastern Standard
Time (EST), there had been 1,971,302 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 111,620 deaths from the virus in the
United States, with both figures significantly higher than those of other countries. For the United States, which

2/8
boasts the strongest economic and technological strength and the most abundant medical resources in the world,
this is a sad irony.
Ignoring the Pandemic Warnings. According to the revisited timeline of the pandemic in the United States, which
was released by The New York Times and Washington Post in April 2020, the U.S. government had repeatedly
ignored the pandemic warnings and slacked off on pandemic control. In early January, the National Security Council
(NSC) received intelligence reports predicting the spread of the virus in the United States. On January 29, Peter
Navarro, Director of the Office of Trade and Manufacturing Policy at the White House, laid out in striking detail the
potential risks of a coronavirus pandemic: as many as half a million deaths and trillions of dollars in economic
losses. U.S. health officials and medical experts, such as Secretary of the United States Department of Health and
Human Services Alex Azar, also repeatedly warned of the deadly pandemic in the United States. Unfortunately, the
U.S. government ignored these warnings. Instead, it focused on controlling the spreading of information, restricted
medical experts' freedom to release information on the pandemic to the public, and even published false
information to mislead the public, such as calling the virus ""a flu"", claiming that the virus has low infection and
fatality rates, and saying that ""One day it's like a miracle, it will disappear."" Under such circumstances, the ""golden
window"" period for infectious disease prevention and control was wasted. Even then, many members of the U.S.
Senate, including Richard Burr, who was the chairman of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee, were involved in
insider trading scandals. They used their positions to understand the serious situation of the pandemic earlier, but
they downplayed the risk of the pandemic in front of the public while selling a large number of stocks before the
pandemic triggered a stock market crash. In this way, they had a ""perfect hedge"".
Prioritizing Capital Interests. The website of The New York Times reported on April 13, 2020, that the White House
COVID-19 Response Working Group and the NSC jointly prepared a memo dated February 14, which was titled
""U.S. Government Response to the 2019 Novel Coronavirus."" According to the report, the memo documented
drastic pandemic-control measures including: ""significantly limiting public gatherings and cancellation of almost all
sporting events, performances, and public and private meetings that cannot be convened by phone. Consider
school closures."" Nevertheless, the decision-makers immediately rejected the memo after hearing that the
measures would lead to the collapse of the U.S. stock market. This showed how the U.S. government prioritized
capital interests and the response of the capital market, rather than making the people's right to life and health a
priority. Due to this, the U.S. government failed to give effective warnings to the public and failed to get prepared
for the potential consumption of medical resources caused by the pandemic, bringing the American people to the
brink of infection and death.
Politicizing the Anti-pandemic Endeavor. When the virus broke out in the United States, some U.S. politicians used it
as a weapon to attack political opponents and seek election benefits instead of regarding the drive to protect the
lives and health of their people as their top priority. The website of The Lancet, an authoritative medical journal,
published an editorial on May 16, which was a rare case for the journal. The editorial explicitly pointed out the
intervention of political parties in the public health sector of the United States, and the weakening role of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It criticized the U.S. government for not actively adopting basic
medical and anti-pandemic measures such as detection, tracking, and isolation, placing its hopes on ""magic bullets""
such as vaccines and new drugs, and hoping that the virus would eventually ""magically disappear"". On May 4, the
famous U.S.political scientist Francis Fukuyama published the article The Wages of American Political Decay on the
website The National Interest, pointing out that the highly polarized party politics made the political checks and
balances an insurmountable obstacle to decision-making; that the pandemic, which should have been an
opportunity to put aside differences and show unity, further deepened the political polarization. Politicians viewed
the pandemic as an opportunity to seize power and partisan interests, and this came at the cost of the lives of
countless American people.
Leading to Catastrophic Consequences. The website of The New York Times reported on May 20, 2020, that
research by Columbia University of the United States showed that delays in adopting movement restrictions had
caused at least 36,000 people to die. According to the research, if the U.S. government had adopted movement
restrictions one week earlier, it could have saved 36,000 lives, and if the U.S. government had adopted movement
restrictions two weeks earlier, 83 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 could have been avoided. On May 24, The
New York Times unprecedentedly dedicated its entire front page to 1,000 U.S. COVID-19 victims. Their names,
7/7/2021

3/8
ages, and brief descriptions were listed under the headline ""U.S. Deaths Near 100,000, an Incalculable Loss,"" with a
subheadline reading: ""They Were Not Simply Names on a List. They Were Us."" The website of the Time reported on
May 20 that the delayed social-distancing measures caused 90 percent of the deaths from COVID-19 in the United
States, and observed that such a huge loss of life was essentially a failure of U.S. democracy.
2. Inequality within U.S. Society Being Fully Exposed during the Pandemic
In the United States, both liberal and conservative scholars agree on one basic fact that there is stark inequality
within U.S. society. The deep-seated institutional reason for such inequality is that the U.S. government and
political parties have long been manipulated by interest groups, and are unable to formulate and implement tax,
industrial, and social security policies that promote social equality. During the pandemic, the social and economic
inequality within U.S. society has been exposed and exacerbated.
The Elite Class of the United States Being Specially Treated in Coronavirus Testing. Viral infection does not
distinguish between rich and poor, but the limited testing and medical resources were not fairly allocated in the
United States. The website of The New York Times reported on March 19, 2020, that many dignitaries in the United
States somehow underwent virus testing when they had no signs of infection and when nearly every state in the
country lacked testing equipment. Uche Blackstock, an emergency medicine physician, said frustratedly, ""As a
physician, I find it upsetting that celebrities and government officials without symptoms have been able to access
testing quickly with same-day results, while I've had to ration out testing to my patients with turnaround times of
five or seven days."" This obvious injustice has made the public increasingly raise questions. When medical staff and
many patients cannot be diagnosed, whether the privileged class obtains priority testing means that the ordinary
people are deprived of testing opportunities. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an article
on March 21 and commented that when the Titanic hit the iceberg and sank, women and children were protected
and rescued first, but in the face of COVID-19, the United States has first rescued the rich and powerful groups.
The gap between rich and poor in getting the virus tests in the United States has exposed the slackness, confusion,
and injustice in its pandemic prevention and control system.
People at the Bottom of U.S.Society Facing an Increasingly Dangerous Situation. The pandemic has made the lives
of people at the bottom of U.S. society increasingly difficult, and further intensified the social polarization between
rich and poor. According to a CBS report in 2019, nearly 40 percent of Americans would struggle to cover a $400
emergency expense, and 25 percent of Americans skipped necessary medical care because they could not afford
the cost. The website of The Atlantic reported in April 2020 that low-income people in the United States would
usually delay seeing a doctor when they became ill, not because they did not want to recover, but because they had
no money at all. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, tens of millions of people in the United States are not covered
by medical insurance, when intensive care for COVID-19 costs as high as tens of thousands of dollars in the
country. ""To be or not to be"" is not just a philosophical proposition of some literary work, but a realistic choice that
the people at the bottom of U.S. society have to make. Russia Today reported on April 30 that a Gallup survey
revealed that one in seven American adults said that if they or their family members developed symptoms related
to COVID-19, they would probably give up medical treatment because they were worried that they could not afford
the costs. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, pointed out
on April 16 that the poor in the United States were ""being hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic"". He observed,
""Low-income and poor people face far higher risks from the coronavirus due to chronic neglect and discrimination,
and a muddled, corporate-driven federal response has failed them.""
High Unemployment Rates Leading the Working Class into a Crisis of Survival. According to data released by the
U.S. Department of Labor on May 28, 2020, the cumulative number of Americans applying for unemployment relief
from March 15 to May 23 has for the first time reached 40.8 million. Given the high unemployment rate brought
about by the pandemic and the long-existing structural discrimination and polarization between rich and poor, the
U.S. working class's ability to resist risks has greatly diminished. Vox News reported on April 10 that from the
catering industry and tourism to the media industry, the entire U.S. economy has felt the impact of the pandemic,
and just like the impact of other crises, the most vulnerable groups bore the brunt of the economic impact.
According to the report, during the pandemic, the people who are most vulnerable amid layoffs are those who earn
the lowest salaries, such as low-wage workers in the catering and retail industries. According to the report released
7/7/2021
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
4/8
by the National Restaurant Association on April 20, two-thirds of restaurant workers (about 8 million people) have
been dismissed or put on vacation due to the pandemic. When the U.S. government launched the Paycheck
Protection Program (PPP), which was intended to help small-and medium-sized enterprises, some large companies
with sufficient funds took advantage of the rule loopholes to acquire huge loans, but small businesses and small
shops that urgently needed loans to sustain themselves could not get the help. The above-mentioned report also
showed that at least 60 percent of employers said that the existing relief plan of the federal government could not
help them reduce layoffs. All this has revealed that the U.S. working class was the first to feel the pain of the
economic recession brought about by the pandemic, and became the victims of the U.S. government's inefficient
anti-pandemic measures.
3. Racial Discrimination Being Intensified within the United States during the Pandemic
The systemic racial discrimination is a chronic illness of U.S. society. Since 2016, white supremacy has revived and
racial discrimination has intensified in the United States. Social tensions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic,
especially the unequal allocation of limited anti-pandemic resources, have further deepened mainstream society's
discrimination against minorities, such as Asian, African, and Hispanic Americans.
Asian Americans Suffering from Stigmatization. The website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, pointed out on
April 1, 2020 that stereotyping of Asian Americans still happens in the United States, and when reporting on the
COVID-19 situation, some U.S. media always attach photos of Asian faces. The website of The New York Times
observed on April 16 that the COVID-19 pandemic meant isolation for Asian Americans. Since the outbreak of the
virus, Asian Americans have often been humiliated and even attacked in public places. Some U.S.politicians even
deliberately misled the public. After the World Health Organization officially named the new coronavirus ""COVID-
19"", senior U.S. leaders, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, still insisted on referring to the virus as the
""Chinese virus"" or ""Wuhan virus"". They also refused to correct that mistake even after being strongly criticized by
the international community. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial
discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 and April 21 that
politicians of relevant countries proactively expressed xenophobic opinions or made xenophobic implications by
deliberately replacing COVID-19 with other names that linked this particular disease to a particular country or
nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression. The current pandemic-related discrimination has fully
exposed the once-concealed racial prejudice. In the United States, which bills itself as the ""beacon of freedom"",
government officials blatantly incite, guide, and condone racial discrimination, which is tantamount to humiliating
the modern concept of human rights.
African and Hispanic Americans Falling Victims to Severe Racial Inequality. Racial discrimination is deeply rooted in
the history and reality of the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic has put this issue underneath a magnifying
glass and tragically exposed its negative consequences. African Americans across the country are infected with and
die from COVID-19 at a disproportionately higher rate than any other group in the United States. The Michigan
Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) released a racial breakdown of the state's confirmed COVID-
19 cases and COVID-19 deaths on April 2, 2020, which showed that African Americans, who make up only 12
percent of Michigan's population, accounted for 33 percent of Michigan's confirmed COVID-19 cases and 40 percent
of the state's COVID-19 deaths. National statistics released by the CDC showed that as of May 13, African
Americans accounted for 22.4 percent of deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. This percentage is
significantly higher than the African Americans'12.5 percent share of the total U.S.population. African Americans in
Kansas, Illinois, and Missouri accounted for only 5.7 percent, 14.1 percent, and 11.6 percent of the total population
of the states, respectively, but accounted for 29.7 percent, 30.3 percent, and 35.1 percent of these states' deaths
from COVID-19.Hispanic Americans also have disproportionately higher infection and fatality rates during the
pandemic. In early April, New York City released a racial breakdown of the city's deaths from COVID-19.According
to it, Hispanic Americans accounted for 34 percent of the city's fatal cases of COVID-19. The website of The New
York Times pointed out on April 14 that the fact the pandemic infected and killed African and Hispanic Americans at
disproportionately higher rates was the result of a health gap directly created by the historical inequality of wealth
and opportunities. The website of the Financial Times, a British newspaper, pointed out on May 15 that African
Americans and Hispanic Americans were more likely than whites to perform the work that was necessary for the
maintenance of social operations, making them more susceptible to poverty, diabetes, high blood pressure, and

COVID-19. The report also pointed out that this pandemic exacerbated the racial differences in the United States,
and that nothing could better display the difference in skin color in the United States than the life and death stories
in the pandemic shutdown. On May 25, George Floyd, an African-American man from Minnesota, died after a white
police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for several minutes during his arrest. This led to large-scale protests
and demonstrations across the United States, once again exposing the dissatisfaction and anger that the American
people have for the worsening racial inequality.
Frequent Racist Violence. During the pandemic, racist violence has haunted the United States, and Asian Americans
suffer from venomous personal attacks. From March 19 to April 1, 2020, alone, the U.S. nonprofit organization
""Stop AAPI Hate ""received more than 1,100 reports of hate incidents. In February 2020, a 16-year-old Asian boy in
Los Angeles was accused of being a ""virus carrier"" and viciously beaten at school. On March 14, in a supermarket in
Midland, Texas, a 19-year-old man deliberately stabbed an Asian man and his two young children with a knife on
the ground that ""they were Chinese and were spreading the novel coronavirus to others."" On April 5, an Asian
woman in Brooklyn, New York City, was attacked by a racist who spilled unidentified chemical liquid on her to
severely burn her upper body, face, and hands when she was emptying rubbish at her door. Violent incidents have
further exacerbated the social tension during the pandemic, and problems such as a divisive society, racial divide,
and the proliferation of guns have worsened. On April 15, nearly 200 U.S. foreign policy scholars and former
diplomats jointly issued a statement in USA Today, pointing out that hate crimes and violent attacks against Asian
Americans sounded the alarm for the United States, and that leaders at all levels and in all sectors should take
action to oppose racism against Asians and end hate crimes against Asian communities.
4. Vulnerable Groups in the United States Struggling to Survive during the Pandemic
The care for the survival of socially disadvantaged and marginalized groups represents the virtue of a society. It is
also a touchstone for the human rights situation in a country. During the pandemic, the features of the United
States' cruel capitalism have been fully exposed, which have forced the elderly, homeless people, and children into
a tragic situation.
The Elderly, the ""Victims"" of the Government's Ineffectiveness in Fighting the Pandemic. UN Secretary-General
Antonio Guterres has repeatedly stressed that the elderly, like young people, have the same rights to life and health
amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and no person is expendable. Unfortunately, during the epidemic in the United
States, the elderly group, which is naturally at greater risk, has been further weakened and marginalized due to
age discrimination, and the elderly's right to life has not been ensured. On March 23 and April 22,2020, Texas
Lieutenant Governor Dan Patrick expressed in interviews with Fox News that he would rather die than see public
health measures damage the U.S. economy and take the risk of restarting the U.S. economy at the cost of elderly
people's lives. Ben Shapiro, the editor-in-chief of The Daily Wire, which is a right-wing U.S. media outlet, declared
coldly on an interview show on April 29, ""If somebody who is 81 dies of COVID-19, that is not the same thing as
somebody who is 30 dying of COVID-19."" He also said, ""If grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, and that's
tragic and that's terrible, also the life expectancy in the United States is 80."" The website of The New York Times
reported on May 11 that at least 28,100 occupants and staff members of long-term care institutions such as
nursing homes in the United States have died of COVID-19, accounting for about one-third of COVID-19 deaths in
the United States. In these care institutions, many elderly people live in a relatively closed environment, so their
risk of death from COVID-19 infection is very high. The website of The Atlantic published two articles respectively
on March 28 and April 29, titled Ageism Is Making the Pandemic Worse and We're Literally Killing Elders Now. They
pointed out that long-existing defects in the old-age care system, such as insufficient capital investment and
staffing, caused the United States to fall behind in ensuring the rights and interests of the elderly, and that such a
situation was due to many political reasons. The website of the Washington Post observed on May 9 that the U.S.
anti-pandemic action had become a state-approved massacre that deliberately sacrificed the lives of the elderly, the
working class, African Americans, and Hispanic Americans.
The Homeless Having Nowhere to Go during the Pandemic. The website of USA Today reported on April 22, 2020,
that more than 550,000 people were homeless every night in the United States. The report also pointed out that
according to the statistics released by the Homeless Alliance, about 17 out of every 10,000 Americans have
experienced homelessness and about 33 percent of them are families with children. Many of the homeless

https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
6/8
Americans are elderly people and disabled people. Given their originally poor physical health and bad living and
hygienic conditions, they are susceptible to the virus. During the epidemic, the homeless who are living on the
streets are deported and forced to live in temporary shelters for isolation. The website of Reuters reported on April
23 that the crowded shelters made it impossible for the homeless who lived there to maintain social distance, which
made it easier for the virus to spread. As of April 20, 43 homeless people living in New York City's shelters had died
from infection of COVID-19, and 617 tested positive for COVID-19.The website of The New York Times reported on
April 13 that the shelters for the homeless had become a delayed-action bomb of a virus outbreak in New York City,
where more than 17,000 people lived and slept almost side by side in centralized shelters. The website of Nature
journal reported on May 7 that when researchers began conducting virus testing on homeless people in the United
States, they found that the situation there had gotten out of control. The website of the Boston Globe reported on
May 4 that 596 homeless people in Boston had been diagnosed with COVID-19, accounting for one-third of the
confirmed cases in the region.
The website of the Los Angeles Times reported on May 14 that research showed that due to the impact of the
pandemic, the number of homeless people in the United States might surge by as much as 45 percent within a
year, further exacerbating the public health crisis.
Worrisome Situation of Poor Children and Immigrant Children. The United States has not yet ratified the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which is one of the core international human rights conventions. In
recent years, child poverty and abuse has remained a grave problem in the United States. This problem has been
exacerbated by the pandemic. Forbes News reported on May 7, 2020 that a survey showed a large number of
American children were facing hunger during the pandemic. As of the end of April, more than one-fifth of American
households had been facing food crises, and two-fifths of American households with children under 12 years of age
have been facing such crises. Forbes News reported on May 9 that the number of child exploitation reports in the
United States surged during the pandemic. The National Center for Missing &Exploited Children received 4.2 million
reports in April, an increase of 2 million from March 2020 and an increase of nearly 3 million from April 2019. Apart
from that, a more worrisome fact is that a large number of unaccompanied immigrant children are still being held in
detention centers in the United States. They are currently in an extremely dangerous situation during the
pandemic. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights of migrants Felipe Gonzalez Morales and other
UN human rights experts issued a joint statement on April 27, requesting the U.S. government to transfer
immigrants from overcrowded and insanitary detention centers. On May 29, 15 experts of the Special Procedures of
United Nations Human Rights Council issued a joint statement urging the United States to take more measures to
prevent virus outbreaks in the detention centers. The website of the United Nations reported on May 21 that since
March, the U.S. government had repatriated at least 1,000 unaccompanied immigrant children to Central and South
America regardless of the risk of the pandemic. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) criticized this move,
for it would expose the children to greater danger.
5. Relevant Behaviors of the U.S. Government Seriously Violating the Spirit of International Human Rights Law
When the citizens' right to life and health is severely threatened by the spreading pandemic, the U.S. government,
instead of focusing on controlling the pandemic, wields a hegemonic stick and fans the flames of trouble
everywhere, trying to divert attention and shirk responsibility. Its behaviors have seriously undermined the
international community's concerted efforts to control the pandemic.
Ineffective Anti-pandemic Efforts Failing the National Duty of Ensuring the Citizens' Right to Life. The International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) stipulates that every human being has the inherent right to life, and
countries are obliged to take proactive measures to guarantee their citizens' right to life. As a party to the
convention, the U.S.government, however, has not given priority to its citizens' right to life and health during the
pandemic. Instead, it has been prioritizing the political campaign at home and the political drive to suppress China
abroad, rather than safeguarding the lives and safety of its citizens. Given this, it has missed the best chance to
curb the spread of the virus, and caused a grave human rights disaster in which about 2 million people have been
infected with COVID-19, and more than 110,000 have died from the virus. Clearly, the U.S. government has failed
to fulfill its due national obligations to protect its people's lives from the threat of epidemics. The website of The
Independent, a British newspaper, commented on April 10, 2020, that the United States, an active advocator for
7/7/2021
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
7/8
human rights, ignored its own human rights obligations and blatantly overlooked its citizens' lives. The website of
the Huffington Post reported on May 6 that after making a rigorous assessment of the U.S. government's poor
performance during the COVID-19 pandemic, Yale University epidemiologist Gregg Gonsalves directly pointed out
that this was getting awfully close to genocide by default.
Maliciously Stigmatizing China in Violation of the Principles of Equality and Non-discrimination. The principles of
equality and nondiscrimination are the core norms of international human rights laws and are confirmed by a series
of international human rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Since the outbreak
of the virus, high-ranking U.S. government officials have violently disregarded human conscience and ethical
bottom lines. To maintain the U.S. hegemony, these officials have politicized the pandemic and constantly
stigmatized China by referring to the virus as the ""Wuhan Virus"" or the ""China virus"".When the scientific community
came to the conclusion that the exact source of the virus was from nature, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo
still repeatedly claimed that the virus came from some lab in Wuhan according to some ""intelligence reports"" he
read. These politicians' behaviors have clearly violated World Health Organization Best Practices for the Naming of
New Human Infectious Diseases, which was jointly issued by the World Health Organization, the World Organization
for Animal Health, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in 2015. The way they refer to
the virus goes against the World Health Organization's suggestion for the official name of the novel coronavirus
disease. The United Nations Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia
and related intolerance, Tendayi Achiume, pointed out on March 23 that some U.S. government officials refused to
use the internationally-recognized name of the virus and deliberately replaced it with other names that linked this
particular disease to a particular country or nation, which was an irresponsible and disturbing expression that came
from and would give rise to racism, xenophobia, stigmatization, and exclusion of certain groups, and violence
against certain groups. She held that such behaviors were unforgivable and incompatible with the obligations
stipulated by the international human rights laws.
Suspending the Payment of WHO Membership Fees Impeding the Joint Anti-Pandemic Efforts of the International
Community. In order to shirk its responsibility for its disastrous anti-pandemic measures, the U.S. government tried
to scapegoat the World Health Organization by fabricating false charges against the organization and threatening to
stop paying its membership fees. On April 14, 2020, the U.S. government announced its suspension of paying dues
to the WHO, which was unanimously criticized by the international community. UN Secretary-General Antonio
Guterres issued a statement on April 14 stating that when the world was fighting the COVID-19 pandemic, it was
inappropriate to reduce the resources required by the WHO or any other humanitarian organization for operations.
The President of the American Medical Association, Patrice Harris, issued a statement on April 15 stating that
combating the pandemic required international cooperation and that the suspension of financial support to the WHO
at this critical moment is a dangerous step in the wrong direction. Josep Borrell, the European Union High
Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, expressed on April 15 that at this time, there was no reason
to justify such an action. On April 15, the website of The Guardian, a British newspaper, published an editorial and
commented that when the world desperately needed to jointly overcome this threat that the world had never
experienced before, the suspension of the WHO dues by the U.S.government was an act that lacked morality and
disrupted the international order, and was a horrible betrayal to global solidarity. German Foreign Minister Heiko
Maas said on April 16 that the WHO was the mainstay of the global fight against the pandemic, and the suspension
of the WHO dues by the United States at this time ""would be nothing other than throwing the pilot out of the plane
in mid-flight"".Under such circumstances, the U.S.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo once again attacked the WHO on
April 22, threatening to permanently suspend the payment of dues. On May 29, the president of the United States
announced the suspension of relations with the WHO.
Unilateral Sanctions Violating the Spirit of Humanitarianism and the Principle of International Cooperation.
International cooperation is the cornerstone of the existence and operation of the international community. It is an
important principle for ensuring the implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms across the globe. It
is also a national obligation stipulated by international instruments, such as the Charter of the United Nations. At
this critical moment when the deadly pandemic spreads globally and threatens human life, health, and well-being,
all countries should work together to respond to the pandemic and maintain global public health security.
Nevertheless, during this pandemic, the U.S. government has still imposed sanctions on countries such as Iran,
Cuba, and Venezuela, which made it difficult for the sanctioned countries to obtain needed anti-pandemic medical

Sonali Malaviya never obsessed about her sleep, until now. ""Normally, I would go to bed at 10:30 in the night and wake up by 6 am,"" says the Gurgaon-based tech marketing
professional, who is in her early 40s. Over the last three months, though, she has been getting up at 3 am every night. ""I check my sleep tracking app once a week and it
shows that I am only getting four hours of sleep every day.
Typically, when you wake up in the night, you go back to sleep. These days the mind is never at rest so that is not happening anymore,"" says Malaviya, filing it under latent
Covid-19 stress.
The lack of sleep has emerged as a major casualty in the wake of the global pandemic and the subsequent lockdown it has brought about in many countries, say insomnia
therapists around the world. People across age groups are worried about catching Covid or passing it on to their family. They are concerned about job security. In many cases,
the lockdown restrictions leave them with nothing time-bound to wake up to either. All these have led to ""almost everyone"" seeking therapy complaining of lack of sleep or a
ruptured sleep cycle, say the therapists. And at least one-third of these are facing this issue for the first time.
Ravi Kant, a 27-year-old student from IIM-Shillong, started having sleepless nights after the lockdown forced him to return to his hometown, Patna, thereby disrupting his
college routine. Though the classes shifted online, worries about an uncertain future keep him wide awake till the wee hours of the morning. He now uses the time between
midnight and 6 am to focus on studying instead.
76663983""If users express anxiety over tracking their sleep, we advise them to scrap the trackers and concentrate on how they feel in the morning. That is the best sleep
quality score you will ever get"" Carl Johan Hederoth, CEO, Sleep Cycle
""Family has also accepted this as my new normal."" As people are getting sleepless in Seattle, Shoreditch and Shillong, some are reaching out to tech for help. The downloads of
sleep tracking app Sleep Monitor were up by 1.5X between April and May, and by 2X from May to June so far, at over a million Android installs. ""We saw a lot of users from the
US and European countries (mainly from France, Italy, the UK, German, Turkey, Poland) from March to May,"" says a company spokesperson via email. ""In May and June, we saw
users increasingly downloading the app from Brazil, Indonesia, Vietnam and Egypt. All those were organic users.""
76663832""People of colour are likely to have more sleep-related anxieties during these times. They prefer going to practitioners of colour but there aren't a lot of insomnia
experts of colour in the country"" Joshua Tal, sleep and health psychologist, New York
Medication for sleep is the most preferred route in the US, say the therapists. In India, however, people prefer trying yoga, exercises, sleep-centric music and podcasts.
Sleep featured in the top 10 moods for users in India every week on Spotify since mid-April. Over the last three months, India was also among the top 10 streaming markets for
popular sleep podcasts on the music-streaming app, according to data shared by the company's PR team.
Over 40% of the people approaching MindPeers, a mental health tech platform, suffer from sleep-related issues, says founder Kanika Agarwal who shuttles between Delhi and
Singapore. ""Some people who reached out hadn't slept in 3-4 days,"" she says. The platform is active in Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru at present. Ishita Pateria, a counselling
psychologist based in Mumbai, says she has seen a 70% spike in mild to major cases of insomnia among her clients in the past two months.

daysSleep featured in Top 10 moods on Spotify for Indian users every week since mid-AprilJust why are so many people around the world having sleepless nights these days?
Lindsay Browning, a sleep expert from London, explains it with an analogy: ""If you see a lion coming to attack you, you will not be able to fall asleep, will you? Your body senses
it to be a life-threatening danger and reacts accordingly. Heart rate goes up, so does your breathing rate, and there is a sudden rush of adrenaline.
It prompts the person to run in the opposite direction."" Covid-19 is what many see as a similar danger coming at them. ""But this time you can't physically run away."" So, the
body responds to stress by staying awake.
76663842""Short-term sleep problems aren't going to kill anybody. Else, every new set of parents would be dead. Our bodies will be able to recover from this"" Lindsay Browning,
sleep expert, London
The lockdown-led challenges don't help. The human body has a circadian rhythm that takes cues from the sun to follow a routine which keeps them awake during the day and
asleep at night. ""A lot of people, say, in countries like Italy and cities like New York, live in flats that don't get enough sunshine to get these cues. While working from home,

Donald Trump called the coronavirus 'Kung Flu' and 'the Chinese virus' during a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20 and Twitter users, especially Asian Americans, are
calling him out for racism. 
The US President blamed China for the global spread of coronavirus, while terming the disease ‘Kung Flu’. 
Trump, addressing his first election rally on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, after the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in the US early this year, said that the COVID-19 is a
disease and has many names. 
“I can name – Kung flu. I can name 19 different versions of names. Many calls it a virus, which it is. Many calls it a flu. What difference. I think we have 19 or 20 versions of the
name,"" he said. 
Soon after, ‘Kung Flu’ started trending on Twitter. Many users bashed Trump for using the term, calling it racist. 
Posting updates on Trump’s address, Twitter user @PhilipRucker wrote: “Trump tells his rally crowd there are ‘many’ names for COVID-19. Then he utters one, ‘Kung Flu’, which
many people consider racist.” 
In a consecutive tweet, @PhilipRucker wrote: “To be clear, calling COVID-19 ‘Kung Flu’ is racist, period.” 
Normalises racism 
Ted W. Lieu, @tedlieu, an American politician serving as the US Representative for California's 33rd congressional district since 2015, took to his Twitter account to express his
thoughts on the issue: “Dear @realDonaldTrump & @GOP: Asian Americans make up 11 per cent of the electorate in Nevada; 5.5 per cent in Texas and 4.7 per cent in Georgia,
enough to be the margin of victory. Keep saying racist […] like Kung Flu. Your racism is one reason Asian Americans now trend towards Democrats. #TrumpRally” 
American actor, Chris Evans, @ChrisEvans, was left “speechless”: “Did the president of the United States just say ‘Kung flu’ at his rally? He made a racist joke. He made. A
racist. Joke. To applause. I’m speechless.” 
Tweep @eugenegu posted about how such actions could fuel discrimination against Asian Americans in the US: “When the President of the United States uses racist terms like
Kung Flu, Chinese Virus, or China Plague, my biggest fear as an Asian American is that it normalises racism against us and there’s no way for us to fight it. We have very little
representation in government and media.” 
In the past, Trump administration officials have used similar terms. 
Kevin McCarthy, the House minority leader, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, are among those who added a geographical marker to the coronavirus. 
Pompeo has called the virus the “Wuhan coronavirus”, referring to the Chinese city where the outbreak started, and McCarthy has used the term “Chinese coronavirus”.

New York, June 24 (IANS) An Indian restaurant has been vandalised with racist graffiti written amid the devastation left by the attack in New Mexico state, according to media
reports.
Local leaders and the community are rallying behind the Sikh-owned restaurant, India Palace, in Santa Fe, which suffered $100,000 in damages during the attack discovered on
Monday, the Santa Fe New Mexican newspaper reported.
Besides causing extensive damage to the restaurant, the vandals had written slogans in support of President Donald Trump and ""White Power"", and racist remarks like ""Go
Home,"" according to the Santa Fe Reporter.
It said that the kitchen was completely made unusable, tables were overturned, glassware was smashed, wine racks were emptied, the statue of a ""goddess"" was beheaded and
computers were stolen.
The restaurant had reopened only recently after being closed due to the COVID-19 restrictions.
Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted on Tuesday, ""We will not stand for such hatred in New Mexico."" She added that she had spoken to restaurant-owner Bajit Singh to ""let
him know that our community is with him.""
Mayor Alan Webber described the vandalism a ""sickening and appalling"" hate crime and vowed, ""We will find whoever did it and punish them to the full extent of the law.""
He said, ""The Singhs are a long-standing Sikh family that has used its own resources to feed homeless Santa Feans through the goodness of their hearts. For them to be
attacked this way breaks our hearts.""
The Singh family distributes free packages of food and sanitary products for homeless people in the area and these items were stolen during the attack, according to the
Reporter.
The Reporter said that five fundraising campaigns have been launched to help the restaurant.
A 'GoFundMe' campaign by another restaurant Paper Dosa had raised more than $35,000, the New Mexican said.
One of the pictures of the graffiti posted on the Reporter's website was against the terrorist organisation Islamic State.
Because of their turbans, Sikhs are sometimes mistaken for Islamists or Iranian clergy who are represented in the media with turbans and are attacked.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper said in a statement, ""This disturbing hate attack once again demonstrates that
growing white supremacy, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racism target every minority community and must be challenged by people of all races, faiths and backgrounds.""

The coronavirus pandemic is impacting every aspect of normal life, including higher education. Colleges and universities have been pushed into uncertainty as they are impelled
to transform to online-only courses while struggling with many other issues, particularly in terms of finances.  
International students are also suffering from pandemic issues. One can witness the financial struggle of international students here at the University of Leeds in the UK,
especially in terms of accommodations, rent, food and other expenses. Support offered by universities includes providing hardship funds for students in financial difficulty.
Universities are also providing pastoral and mental health support. Yet this seems not to be a permanent solution.  
As the universities frenziedly discuss whether they can safely reopen their campuses, even sending most students encouraging messages about the possibility of returning in the
fall, Notre Dame in the US became one of the first major universities in the country to announce detailed plans for bringing back students, saying it would put in effect 'a
regimen of testing and contact tracing, put quarantine and isolation protocols in place and require students to maintain social distancing and wear masks in public.' 
Even if universities reopen, will international students come to the UK and US? British universities fear that the loss of tens of thousands of Chinese students next year will lead
to gaping holes in their budgets, after the survey by the British Council has found that only a quarter of those intending to study in the UK were still going ahead with their
plans. According to the Higher Education Statistics Agency, the number of Chinese students studying at British universities rose above 120,000 for the first time last year, up
from 89,000 in 2014-15. Their tuition fees are a key source of income.  
There is a challenge for Chinese students coming to Western universities: rising Sinophobia. My PhD thesis elaborated on Islamophobia in the university context. Having carried
out research through interviews, it concluded that media exerts an enormous impact on the rise of Islamophobia on campus. Now is also the time to talk about the Sinophobia
and racism that re-emerged with media coverage of the coronavirus. The excessive coverage evokes Sinophobia and racism that have real, harmful consequences for current
and future Chinese and Asian students in universities.  
In the early days of the US response to the pandemic, President Donald Trump incessantly labeled COVID-19 'the Chinese virus.' 'This language from the most powerful
individual in the world was the most dangerous example of scapegoating for political purposes,' says Gordon H. Chang, a professor of American history at Stanford University.
The Daily Columbian Spectator reported that 'Chinese and Asian students have recently been the target of racist discrimination, including a hateful message in Butler Library –
and the name tags of two Chinese students, which were affixed to a suite door to identify the residents living there, had been burned in late January in the wake of the
coronavirus outbreak.' 
The global Sinophobia fueled by the media is of significant consequence. People use the coronavirus as an excuse to harass Asian university students and bully Asian children.
Sinophobia killed a man in Australia, as bystanders refused to perform CPR, fearing that he might carry the disease. 
Yinxuan Huang, a sociology research fellow at City University London who has been carrying out research among Chinese Christian communities in the UK during the
coronavirus crisis, said: 'Almost all incidents they reported were associated with ‘maskaphobia,’' which is a fear of masks which then triggered racist attacks. 'Most of the victims
– some got called ‘virus’ and others got shoved – were wearing masks when they were attacked.' 
'Many Chinese students feel that the issue of the mask is the single biggest cultural shock they have ever experienced in the UK. They are now facing a dilemma and have to
choose between two bad choices – insecurity (for coronavirus) and fear (for racism).' 
Despite the fact that US lawmakers are encouraging major social media platforms – such as Facebook, Google and Twitter – to cooperate in promoting credible information
about the virus outbreak, this seems to be ineffective. Universities and individual community members must also participate in efforts to curb misinformation and Sinophobia. 
I loved learning about Chinese cuisine and banquets with my Chinese friends during my PhD time at the University of Leeds. I was infatuated with Asian hospitality and their
contribution to academia here. The university holds a special Chinese New Year annual event. We, the international students, believe that the UK is a place that values
tolerance, equality, diversity and rule of law. 
The growing coronavirus-related racism is disturbing. As racial vilification will not end easily, American and British universities should consider taking measures to combat
against Sinophobia on campuses and in dorms, as well as worrying about reopening and financial issues stemming from tuition fees.  
The author is an independent journalist and lecturer at the University of Leeds.

202104,"
Racism is still a major issue in today’s America, with bias based on skin color, race and perceived nationality.
Adding to this, and creating further division and complications, is the brutality from some of the people who are supposed to protect us: the police.
In 1967, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said, “Racial injustice is still the Negro’s burden and America’s shame.”
Most people today know what is no longer acceptable, but still it seems that every single day we read or hear examples of privileged white Americans endangering the lives of
African American individuals.
A recent example was a white woman antagonizing an African American man trying to peacefully bird-watch in New York’s Central Park after he simply asked her to follow the
rules and put a leash on her dog. After seeing the video, it was blatantly clear that a divide still exists between races, and that a racist white woman could exploit racist law
enforcement and possibly get an innocent man killed. This is just one instance of many.
Currently, we are living through a pandemic that has been hard on all of us. But how about those who have been attacked in public for being Asian because of the twisted idea
that every individual of Chinese — or even just Asian — descent is to blame for COVID-19? It is absolutely disgraceful and unacceptable, and it is unconscionable that Asian
Americans are being targeted because of the stereotyping of a country. Perhaps this should not be surprising, however, as President Donald Trump labeled the novel coronavirus
“the Chinese virus” and blamed the Chinese for the events that have unfolded.
According to The New York Times, a woman named Yuanyuan Zhu said “a middle-aged man started shouting at her while she was walking to her gym and then spat at her as
she waited to cross the street.”
In February, according to PhillyVoice.com, a 16-year-old student was beaten and hospitalized in Los Angeles in what officials called “racial backlash,” caused by stereotypes
surrounding the coronavirus. That website reported that a video had captured an Asian man in New York City “minding his own business before a bucket of water was dumped
on him. He confronted and fought his attacker.” It also reported on a video showing a “possibly racially motivated attack” on an Asian couple by juveniles in a Philadelphia
subway station.
Perhaps the hardest thing to accept is the racism and injustice within the police system. There are too many examples to mention — but the May 25 police killing of George
Floyd is among the worst. African Americans are told, “As long as you follow the rules, do what you’re told, and stay out of trouble, you’ll be safe” — and then they witness their
compliant friends and family being harmed and even killed by the police, our “protectors.”
Some would say that racism is not nearly as bad as it used to be and that America has come a long way. I completely agree; I find it amazing to see how much things have
changed. But there is so much work still to be done.
Just because we have come so far does not mean we can ignore the obvious division and racism that still exist in America today.
Change must continue to happen for the United States to truly be free and equal for every individual.
“We must face the hard fact that many Americans would like to have a nation which is a democracy for white Americans but simultaneously a dictatorship over black
Americans,” King said. “We must face the fact that we still have much to do in the area of race relations.”
Again, that was in 1967.
Fifty-three years later, we still have much to do.

A survey in Canada has confirmed reports that racism against people of Chinese ethnicity has been on the rise since the country reported its first cases
of Covid-19 in March.
Half of the Chinese-Canadians polled said they had been called names or insulted as a direct consequence of the pandemic and 43 per cent said they
had been personally threatened or intimidated.
More than 60 per cent of respondents had adjusted their daily routines in a bid to avoid unpleasant encounters.
The survey, which questioned 516 Canadians of Chinese ethnicity, was conducted by the University of Alberta and the Angus Reid Institute, a non-profit
public opinion research agency, against a backdrop of rising anti-China and anti-Asian racism, as well as xenophobia.
Vancouver police said in May that anti-Asian hate crime was on the rise, with 16 reports made in March and April, compared to 12 in the whole of 2019.
Also in May, two lion statues at the entrance to the city's Chinatown were defaced twice with racist graffiti.
Discrimination has been stoked by the use of terms such as ""Chinese virus"" and ""Wuhan virus"" by senior figures in the United States, including
President Donald Trump and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. While Trump dropped references to the ""Chinese virus"" in late March, he has recently
returned to racially charged terms like ""kung flu"" and ""Chinese flu"" at his campaign events.
The survey found two-thirds of respondents felt coverage from North American news outlets had led to negative views of Chinese-Canadians, while
three in 10 said they were frequently exposed to racist graffiti or messaging on social media.
A quarter said they were treated with less respect because of their Chinese ethnicity and a similar share said they were made to feel as though they
posed a threat to the health and safety of their fellow Canadians.
One man in his 60s told the survey team he had been spat at by a cyclist, while a woman in her 20s said: ""Walking down the street with a mask on,
there have been instances where people will scream at me to go back to China or swear and say other racist remarks. I look Chinese but I am not from
China, even though I have Chinese heritage. Makes it all very confusing.""
Another respondent, a woman in her 30s, said she had been repeatedly yelled at in the streets of her neighbourhood.

Had he stuck to his initial plans, Mr Darius Cheong, 21, would be heading to the University of Virginia to study business management in August this year.
He was convinced that four years in the United States would give him global exposure. But then the pandemic hit and reports of racist attacks on Asians in the US also worried
him.
Mr Cheong has decided to alter course. Instead of going to the US, he has opted to pursue his degree studies at the Singapore Management University, which is known for its
American style of teaching.
Similarly, Raffles Institution alumna Valerie Lu, 19, was all set to start her degree studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art in the US this September. But after factoring in
the uncertainties and high cost of studying overseas, she applied to and secured a place at the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) instead.
Mr Cheong and Miss Lu are among the Singaporeans who are giving up on their overseas study plans in favour of local universities.
Each of the six local universities received between 19 and 550 applications during the second admissions exercise held last month to cater to late applicants, they told The
Sunday Times.
These included applicants who switched from overseas to local universities.
Another group of applicants were polytechnic diploma holders who had previously thought of going to work but were now opting to study because of the weak job market.
While the universities are still in the process of deciding how many applicants to take in, the National University of Singapore confirmed it had received 450 applications during
the second admissions exercise and SUTD said it had received 550.
Students like Ms Lu and Mr Cheong are the lucky ones, though, with a definite path to pursue.
The Covid-19 outbreak has left many Singaporean students, with plans to study overseas, unsure of what the future holds.
COST CONSIDERATIONS
If teaching is still online, why would I go back? Sydney is not a cheap city to live in.
MS CELINE CHOO, 19, who started her studies at UNSW in February but had to return to Singapore 11/2 months later.
PURSUING ASPIRATIONS
It has been my dream since I was 10 and I have been working hard to get into a university like Stanford. I hope governments
deal with the pandemic and it will still be possible for young people like me to pursue our aspirations.
MS ALICIA CHEONG, 18, who still hopes to study overseas.
Take Ms Stella Cheong, 22. A local university has offered her a place. But she still prefers to head to San Francisco to study business studies there.
The situation has left her undecided. She calls it ""being in a coronavirus limbo"" and is prepared to defer her studies for up to six months.
Singapore Polytechnic alumnus Garreth Benjamin, 24, who headed back to Singapore in March, has also decided to put off the last semester of his commerce degree at the
University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Sydney till next year.
He had earlier planned to take up a three-month internship at an accounting firm in Sydney, but now realises that such positions will be hard to come by, so he is prepared to
wait.

The COVID-19 pandemic presents universities with an opportunity to rediscover their real purpose. This appears to have been lost, at least at the undergraduate level, due in
significant part to a self-destructive business model.
Australian universities have become dependent on the opiate of undergraduate students from overseas. A terrible spiral of needing more money to build more infrastructure to
provide degree programs for overseas students has resulted in the destruction of the quality of undergraduate programs, and consequently the perceived worth of degrees
earned by previous graduates. Two examples demonstrate the toxic state of affairs. One first-year course that regularly had a failure rate of 30 per cent; now, the lecturer
needs the permission of the dean should she/he plan to fail more than 5 per cent. In another course, examination papers need to be handed out in advance so students can
cope with the test. What, then, are overseas students paying for? Not a high-quality educational experience; so presumably it is the supposed cachet associated with an
Australian university degree. How long before their home countries realise this investment is largely valueless? Meanwhile, the reputation of Australian universities sinks lower.
We must restore the quality of the undergraduate educational experience. Initially, this may result in some reduction in income. However, all students - local and overseas - will
benefit.

All the way with the USA
Peter Hartcher correctly warns us of the perils of following in America's footsteps (""Let's not copy a broken empire"", June 6-7 ).
Yet here in NSW, the Berejiklian government is bent on doing that very thing. The government's ability to act as a ""problem-solving mechanism"", which Hartcher points out as
the crucial failure of American government, is continually diminished by the mania for privatisation. Once a service, such as public transport, is privatised, codes of conduct or
regulatory bodies, the guardians of public interest, quickly fade in the face of economic imperatives.
This is the American way, and the Berejiklian government is bent on following it.

Rise of the fossils
A strange convergence or a perfect storm? The world's largest investment group, BlackRock, is acting on its words to withdraw support for the climate-damaging fossil fuel
industry (""As warned, world's biggest investor acts against coal"", June 8).
In NSW, we have a state challenge to the holding of a protest on health and violence grounds. No prizes for guessing the likely next round of major protests will be about
climate.
The groundswell of distaste for government inaction and obfuscation, shown last year before the bushfires and the pandemic, is no doubt sitting in the minds of the Liberal and
National parties and mining strategists. With BlackRock and its ilk appearing on the horizon, get ready for fossil fuel dinosaurs behaving badly.

Rio Tinto destroys an Aboriginal site 46,000 years old and the PM says he hasn't received a brief on it. The NRL chief complains about fans not being allowed in to watch
matches and Scott Morrison is all over it like a rash. Whatever you do, don't say anything negative about the mining industry. After all, mining sites are sacred sites.

NSW Water Minister Melinda Pavey again shows her disregard for water security (""Sydney desal project shelved"", June 8). Pavey has not stopped the expansion of coal mining
under our dam catchments, and the damage to streams below the Tahmoor coal mine. Decreasing rainfall because of climate change has put us on track to a water calamity.
Pavey needs to seriously take on her guardianship of our most precious resource.

""Every day, I pray that you people die.""
That's just one example of the kind of insults and name-calling that half of Chinese Canadians say they have experienced since the coronavirus pandemic arrived in North
America, according to a poll by Angus Reid Institute and the University of Alberta released Monday.
The survey results, taken from 516 Canadians who self-identify as ethnically Chinese, suggest just how commonplace racist behaviour against people of East Asian descent has
become since the pandemic arrived in North America.
Forty-three per cent of respondents said they have been personally threatened or intimidated at least once, and 13 per cent said it happens frequently. Eight per cent of
respondents said they have frequently been physically attacked by strangers.
Researchers from the university helped craft the questions in the survey, conducted June 15-18. The results have a margin of error of plus or minus 4.3 percentage points, 19
times out of 20.
The goal was to collect data on how Chinese Canadians' experience has changed since the pandemic started dominating headlines, said Angus Reid Institute executive director
Shachi Kurl.
""What has made the news and what we hear about tends to be the really overt, violent, more extreme examples"" of such prejudice, she said.
In Vancouver, a man pushed a 92-year-old man with dementia to the ground outside a convenience store while yelling racist insults about COVID-19. In another incident, a man
punched a woman of Asian descent near a bus stop downtown and walked away.
Even Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, has been targeted. Conservative MP Derek Sloan questioned her loyalty to Canada in April, asking, is she ""working for
Canada or working for China?""
""No doubt there would be some out there who say these are just isolated examples,"" said Kurl. ""This study really aims to measure the breadth and the scope and size of the
issue - and now we have a sense of that.""
Six in 10 respondents said they have changed some aspect of their routine in order to avoid abuse, ""run-ins"" or ""unpleasant encounters"" since the pandemic was declared in
Canada. Fifty per cent said they have been insulted or called names due to their ethnicity. One in three survey respondents said they have been made to feel like they posed a
threat to the health and safety of others.
Of the people who participated in the survey, 44 per cent per cent were born in Canada, 22 per cent in China, 22 per cent in Hong Kong and three per cent from Taiwan. Ten per
cent were born in another country.
Nearly 90 per cent of respondents said that being Canadian was an important part of their identity and that they love Canada and what it stands for. Yet a quarter said they feel
like outsiders in their own country. Of those who were born in Canada, one in five said they felt like outsiders.
""These data shows us that everything from insults to a sense of othering, to being made to feel that somehow you're to blame for this - it's all part of what affects someone's
psyche,"" said Kurl.
In a 2016 Angus Reid poll, about half of visible-minority respondents said they believe others see them as Canadians ""all the time."" Respondents in this most recent survey
were asked the same question. Only 13 per cent said they feel this way.
A majority (64 per cent) of respondents said they believe North American news outlets have had a negative effect on Canadians' views of people of Chinese ethnicity.
""The whole point of taking measurement of this is we are no longer dealing with anecdotes. This is something that brings empirical data, that brings facts to what has been, up
to this point, more of an anecdotal conversation,"" said Kurl. ""You can't argue with that.""
The survey, designed with help from University of Alberta researchers, also gave respondents a chance to share details from their experiences. Some of the anonymized
responses were published in the report.
One person wrote, ""While walking on the streets in Kitsilano (Vancouver), a Caucasian man in his 30s said to me and my daughter, 'Every day, I pray that you people die.'""

China News Service: According to reports, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo criticized China's political system and
epidemic response at a press conference on July 8. Do you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: For quite some time Pompeo has been busy concocting fake news to vilify China and drive a wedge between
China and other countries. All this has laid bare his deep-seated Cold War mindset, zero-sum game mentality and
ideological prejudices.
Facts can speak for themselves, while lies repeated a thousand times are still lies. We advise this US politician to rectify
his mistakes and stop spreading the political virus to avoid become a laughing stock.
CCTV: A follow-up question. US Secretary of State Pompeo said in the same interview that ""Beijing claimed for months
that it reported the outbreak of the virus to the WHO. Now we know that's not true."" He also said, the CPC ""has an
enormous credibility problem"", that it ""chose to hide and obfuscate and deny basic truth"", and that it ""has to be held
accountable."" I wonder if you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: The first thing I want to say is, Mr. Pompeo, stop talking about credibility, truth or accountability because we
are so fed up with your words.
Speaking of credibility, while promoting ""America first"" in recent years, the US has been habitually breaching its
international commitments and obligations and withdrawing from organizations and treaties. It is literally the biggest
""trouble maker"" in the world.
Speaking of the truth, I'd like to ask Mr. Pompeo: can US government tell people in America and around the world the

truth behind the Fort Detrick biolab, the EVALI, and the US biolabs located all over the world?
Speaking of accountability, in less than six months, there have been over three million confirmed COVID-19 cases and
more than 130,000 death tolls in the US; the US government should indeed be held accountable for this.
With their own image and reputation hitting rock-bottom, I wonder why Mr. Pompeo and his like are so brazen to talk
about credibility, truth and accountability? We advise those US politicians heed the strong rejection from the international
community to the country's frequent pullback from various agreements and organizations.
After the COVID-19 broke out, China notified the WHO at the earliest time possible, and the timelines published by both
sides have listed all the facts that are mutually corroborated. Turning a blind eye to the internationally acknowledged
facts, Pompeo is so obsessed in fabricating lies and shifting the blame. His behaviors, instead of covering up the
incompetence of the US side to fight the pandemic, only reveal his nature of lying and cheating and some American
officials' hypocrisy, arrogance and ignorance.
Reuters: First question, out of concerns over China's national security law for Hong Kong, the Australian Prime Minister
today announced the decision to suspend the country's extradition agreement with Hong Kong and extend visas for Hong
Kong residents in Australia. Do you have any comment? Second, Global Times cited sources that China is considering
suing the German scholar Adrian Zenz and the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. Can you confirm this? Third question,
in his speech on Sunday, Pope Francis didn't talk about his concerns over freedom and human rights in Hong Kong which
he planned to speak of. Some say Pope Francis may have been under China's pressure. Has China asked the Vatican not
to talk about Hong Kong?
Zhao Lijian: On your first question, the Australian side's comments and measures are in serious violation of international
law and the basic norms governing international relations. They constitute gross interference in China's internal affairs,
and China doesn't accept it. We express strong condemnation and reserve the right to make further reaction, and
Australia should bear all the consequences.
The Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR is an important step to ensure the steady and
sustained implementation of the ""one country, two systems"" principle. Its implementation will strengthen Hong Kong's
legal framework, ensure social order, improve business environment, and contribute to Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability. The attempt to pressure China will never succeed.
China urges Australia to immediately change course, stop intervening in Hong Kong affairs and China's domestic affairs,
and prevent further harm to China-Australia relations.
On your second question, I noticed the report and Adrian Zenz's argument. Why is he so anxious to speak if he's done
nothing to be guilty of? It's common sense that all deliberate slanders should be condemned and held accountable.
As is widely known, Adrian Zenz and the ASPI have been smearing China by fabricating lies. Their rumors on China have
already been proven false by facts like a slap in the face. So if the report you mentioned is true, I'm not even surprised.
It's not the first time that Chinese and foreign media reveal those behind Zenz and the ASPI. I'll not repeat it here. Here's
a piece of advice: come back to the right course as soon as possible, because too many vile deeds will inevitably lead to
one's self-destruction.
On your third question, I am not aware of the situation, but we hope and believe that people of vision who truly care
about Hong Kong will choose to act in ways beneficial to Hong Kong's development. China will continue to engage in
constructive dialogues with the Vatican and work for the improvement of bilateral relations.
Shenzhen TV: The Daily Telegraph reported an Oxford University expert's opinion that as is proved by more and more
evidence, the coronavirus may have lain dormant across the world and emerged when the environmental conditions were
right for it to thrive rather than starting in China. What is China's comment?
Zhao Lijiang: The report once again vindicates the fact that tracing the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue,
and it is up to scientists around the world to conduct international scientific research and cooperation. WHO officials have
said virus tracing is an ongoing process that may involve multiple countries and localities. As this process proceeds, we
should be open to the many possibilities for where the virus may come from.

China continues supporting scientists around the world in conducting global scientific research on the source and route
of transmission of the virus. We also support WHO-led cooperation among member states on the zoonotic source of
COVID-19 and in other fields.
Global Times: Several media outlets have reported that a number of Chinese students in Australia were recently
subjected to racial discrimination and even violent attacks. On July 4, a Chinese student at the University of South
Australia was seriously injured in an abuse and attack near Adelaide's Chinatown by three local men. What is China's
comment?
Zhao Lijian: Recently there has been rising discrimination against overseas Chinese, including Chinese students, and
even Asians in Australia. Some of them suffered violent attacks, and their physical and mental health and even lives
were seriously threatened. In response to these circumstances, the Chinese government issued a travel advisory and
an alert for Chinese students going to study in Australia. This is a truly responsible practice.
We once again remind students who plan to study or are studying in Australia to conduct a risk assessment and be
cautious when making the choice to go or return to Australia, and remind the overseas Chinese in Australia to
strengthen safety precautions. We once again urge the Australian side to face up to the problem and take concrete
measures to protect the safety, rights and interests of Chinese citizens in Australia.
Xinhua News Agency: The website of the US Department of Defense released Secretary Mark Esper's message on the
accomplishments in the implementation of the National Defense Strategy on July 7. He said that ""China and Russia
constitute our top strategic competitors"", and that ""we established a China Strategy Management Group and I directed
the National Defense University to refocus its curriculum by dedicating 50 percent of the coursework to the PRC."" Do
you have any comment?
Zhao Lijian: This US official's remarks and the 2018 National Defense Strategy he mentioned are fundamentally flawed
and run counter to the trend of the times as they preach nothing but obsolete concepts of a Cold-War mentality, a
zero-sum game mindset, and hyped-up strategic competition between major countries.
China's policy towards the US is consistent and clear. We are committed to working with the US side for non-conflict,
non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation. At the same time, we are firmly committed to
safeguarding China's sovereignty, security and development interests. China urges the US to discard its Cold-War
mentality and ideological bias, view the world and China-US relations in the 21st century in a correct way, and work
with China to move forward the bilateral relations along the track of coordination, cooperation and stability.
China Daily: It is reported that Côte d'Ivoire's Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly passed away on July 8. What's
your comment?
Zhao Lijian: We deeply mourn the passing of Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly and extend sincere condolences to
the government of Côte d'Ivoire and his family.
Prime Minister Amadou Gon Coulibaly was friendly to China and made contributions to the development of China-Côte
d'Ivoire relations. China stands ready to work with Côte d'Ivoire for more progress in our friendly cooperation.
The Paper: According to people familiar with the matter, Chinese and Indian armies are expected to carry out a joint
verification to assess the implementation of the disengagement process once the withdrawal of troops is completed in
the western sector of China-India boundary. The two militaries are set to hold extensive talks on bringing back peace
and tranquility in the region. Can you confirm that and give us some updates on the disengagement? Will there be
more bilateral talks between Chinese and Indian troops?
Zhao Lijian: Following the consensus reached at the commander-level talks, the Chinese and India border troops have
been taking effective measures to disengage at Galwan Valley and other areas in the western sector. The overall
situation at the China-India boundary is stable and ameliorating. The two sides will continue to maintain dialogue and
communication through military and diplomatic channels, including holding a new round of commander-level talks and
the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs. We hope India
will work with China towards the same goal to implement consensus reached between the two sides with concrete
actions and jointly de-escalate tensions in the border region.

Biases are forms of discrimination in which we hold unfair beliefs about an entire group of people. These biases can be conscious (explicit) or
unconscious (implicit).
Business Insider spoke to Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, a doctor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, and Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, a researcher of
implicit bias, to gain a greater understanding of bias in medicine.
Both explicit and implicit bias are prevalent in the medical field, and they can affect how patients of different races, genders, faiths, and
sexualities are treated.
Due in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to
the CDC.
Though there has been great progress in reducing explicit biases, implicit biases are much harder to tackle, and they take active participation
to identify and eliminate.
Visit Insider's homepage for more stories.
Biases are present in many human interactions. These typically unfair assumptions, which can encompass entire groups of people, affect how
we feel about and treat members of other races, genders, faiths, weights, sexualities, and abilities. In healthcare, the effect of biases on
patients can lead to dangerous consequences.
Explicit biases, or conscious biases, are easier to detect because they are overt, according to Dr. Chloë Fitzgerald, who co-authored Implicit
bias in healthcare professionals: a systematic review, which was published in BMC Medical Ethics.
""If someone had explicit bias, they might say, 'Oh, you know, obese people just don't work as hard, or they're lazy,'"" Dr. Fitzgerald told
Business Insider. However, ""if it was implicit, they might choose someone else over an obese person to do a task because they'll assume the
obese person will be slower to do it,"" she said.
Dr. Jasmine Marcelin, who co-authored The Impact of Unconscious Bias in Healthcare: How to Recognize and Mitigate It in The Journal of
Infectious Diseases, said a lower presence of minorities in the medical field perpetuates bias.
Dr. Fitzgerald and Dr. Marcelin identified ways biases affect the healthcare industry.
Explicit bias against diverse groups has led to extreme abuse within the medical profession, like the Tuskegee Syphilis Study conducted
between 1932 and 1972.
The Tuskegee Syphilis Study was an experiment that spanned 40 years, starting in 1932. It involved 600 black men, 399 with syphilis, and
201 without the disease, to test the effects of untreated syphilis. The study was carried out without their consent, as researchers told the men

that they were being treated for ""bad blood,"" a term used to describe several ailments, including syphilis, anemia, and fatigue. (In 1974, a $10
million settlement was reached out of court with the participants and their families, and in 1997, President Bill Clinton apologized to them on
behalf of the country.)
""The Tuskegee study demonstrated how conscious bias, in this case manifested in the form of racism, led to the unethical treatment of black
men that continues to have long-lasting effects on health equity and justice in today's society,"" Dr. Marcelin said.
Due in part to biases, black women are three to four times more likely to die from pregnancy-related causes than white women, according to
the CDC.
Dr. Fitzgerald said black women were historically abused by white doctors performing gynecological procedures on them without their consent.
These doctors held the false belief that black women somehow experienced less pain.
The field of infectious diseases is also affected by implicit bias, according to Dr. Marcelin.
She is passionate about reducing biases in the field of infectious disease.
""I definitely think from a pandemic standpoint there is a huge risk for minority groups who are affected. We have a lot of data that shows that
the effects of systemic racism and bias on minority groups has led to worse outcomes in those groups,"" she said.
Black people are 2.4 times more likely to die from the coronavirus.
Data from AMP Research Lab revealed that there were 54.5 coronavirus-related deaths per 100,000 in America's black population, while there
were 22.7 per 100,000 for America's white population.
Though these deaths can be attributed in part to the way systemic racism makes black people less likely to have access to healthy food, green
spaces, and livable wages, they could also be a result of the biases black people experience in healthcare.
A review published in Academic Emergency Medicine compiled studies on implicit bias in healthcare professionals and found that a in a
majority of studies, physicians showed an implicit preference for white patients.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even released guidelines for healthcare professionals to ensure they are not allowing bias to
influence their treatment of patients during the pandemic.
Biases can also affect how medical professionals treat their colleagues, and minority medical professionals face microaggressions.
Microagressions are brief but common negative verbal or non-verbal behaviors against minorities.
An example Dr. Marcelin gave of a microagression is from a YouTube video in which an Asian woman is running on a trail in California, and
another jogger stops her and asks her where she's from. The woman responds that she is from California, but the other person says, ""No, but
where are you from, from?"" This assumes that just because the woman is of Asian heritage, that she cannot be from the United States.
Dr. Marcelin shared that she herself has experienced bias in the workplace — from both patients and colleagues — as an African American
female doctor.
Dr. Marcelin, not pictured, said, ""There are many times that I have walked into patient situations and they have assumed that I am not the one
that's in charge, even after I have identified myself as being the attending. I've had other healthcare professionals barging in on me in the
middle of talking with patients and completely ignoring my presence in the room with the patient. I've had patients who asked me to take out
their trash.""
Minorities in the healthcare field often have to pay the ""minority tax"" at work, Dr. Marcelin added. That is, they expend extra time and effort
trying to combat bias and educate others on the effects of bias, with no compensation for their work.
Many diseases have been historically examined in male bodies, with the assumption that the same diagnoses would apply to women.
Heart attacks, for example, can be experienced differently by women, and doctors have misdiagnosed women who've had them. ""Women can
experience pain in heart attacks in quite different ways that don't fit what we often think of as the classic heart attack,"" said Dr. Fitzgerald.
Men are also affected by biases. They are less likely to be diagnosed with mental health issues since they present them differently, said Dr.
Fitzgerald.
Depressed men may present as angry rather than sad, according to the University of Rochester Medical Center. It is also often harder for men
with depression to get help, due to stereotypes of sadness as weakness in men.
Countries with low rates of obesity have biases against people who are obese.
Biases against the obese often discount genetic and health factors that affect weight.

Community advocates see dangerous times in US with China scapegoating
When Donalene Ferrer, an Asian-American nurse in San Diego, California, walked with her daughter and mother in their
neighborhood, a car drove by and the couple inside it yelled: ""You started the corona!"" They continued yelling obscenities
after they parked in front of a house only three doors from Ferrer's mother's.
""It was pretty disheartening. I cried when the commander-in - chief, or whatever you want to call him, said 'China virus' and
'kung flu'. I kind of knew something was happening,"" said Ferrer, while recounting her encounter that happened three months
ago.
Her experience was one of the more than 800 incidents that took place in California and were self-reported on Stop AAPI
Hate, a website that tracks coronavirus-related racist acts, over the past three months.
Averaging 10 cases per day, these reports reveal a consistent, pervasive pattern of anti-Asian-American hate throughout
California, and they also indicate that ""the racist rhetoric coming from the highest office in the land is creating a dangerous
environment for Asian Americans"", said Cynthia Choi, co-executive director of Chinese for Affirmative Action, at a webinar on
Wednesday.
Those incidents, including verbal harassment and physical assault, are happening at workplaces, in retail and online,
permeating all aspects of daily life, said Choi.
""These two white ladies were moving toward me, but as they passed by me and said:'Go back to China with your dirty
diseases',"" a respondent in Verdugo City, California, was cited as saying in the report released by Stop AAPI Hate on
Wednesday.
""Someone threw a glass bottle at my friend while she was putting her baby in the car and yelled, 'Go home, chink',"" said
another respondent in San Francisco.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, countries should curb the alarming rise in xenophobic incidents and hate speech directed at groups based solely on their race, ethnicity or
nationality because such incidents threaten the solidarity needed to fight the disease, international human rights experts said in an online seminar on Friday.
More than a dozen human rights experts from around the world shared their views at the seminar, which was titled ""Addressing Contemporary Forms of Racism: Challenges
Posed by the Pandemic and the National Responses"".
The seminar was hosted by the Human Rights Center of Central South University, the Wuhan University Institute of International Law and the Cross Cultural Human Rights
Centre at Vrije University Amsterdam.
""People who are perceived or known to be of Chinese or other East Asian descent have been subject to racist and xenophobic attacks related to the virus. Reports received
indicate that racially motivated violence and other incidents against people of Asian descent have reached an alarming level in some countries,"" said E. Tendayi Achiume, the
United Nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, in a statement.
Due to time zone differences, her statement was delivered by Kellie-Shandra Ognimba, from the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
Achiume said Asian-Americans have been subject to such attacks since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. The attacks have ranged from physical assaults, vandalism and
verbal harassment to denial of access to services and public spaces. Women have reported being harassed more than twice as often as men.
The situation is partly caused by irresponsible and discriminatory remarks by some public figures, she said.
""It's dismaying to witness state officials adopting alternative names for COVID-19 instead of using the internationally recognized name of the virus. These officials have adopted
names with geographic references, typically referring to its emergence in China. This sort of calculated use of a geographic-based name for this virus is rooted in and fosters
racism and xenophobia,"" she said.
Naming the virus with geographic references may not constitute as hate speech itself, but it will trigger hate speech, said Sun Shiyan, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences' Institute of International Law.
During the pandemic, COVID-19-related racist hate speech has been rampant in various countries, especially on social media. Such speech not only affects many ethnic groups
but also may threaten international solidarity in efforts to respond to the health crisis, Sun said.
Meanwhile, the Chinese community in the Netherlands has moved from indirectly challenging racist comments to tackling them head on, especially during the outbreak. The
assertiveness of the younger generation has been significant, said Tom Zwart, director of the Amsterdam university's Cross Cultural Human Rights Centre.
On Feb 6, a so-called corona song was broadcast by a radio station in the Netherlands. In the song, a number of crude remarks were made about Chinese people and Chinese
restaurants.
About 60,000 people of Asian origin objected to the song by formally reporting it as a crime to the police. The public prosecutor then announced that it would investigate if the
singer and songwriter had committed the crime of offending a group of people on the basis of race.
On June 2, the prosecutor announced that it had decided not to pursue the case. The decision sparked outrage in the Chinese community, Zwart said.
He added that last week, community representatives opted to challenge the prosecutor's decision, further proof that it is ready to confront the issue in ""a very direct way"".

The latest use of ""China virus"" and ""kung flu"" by the US president and some other US leaders is not just a
presidential election year stunt and a desperate bid to deflect public attention from the administration's failure
to timely and appropriately respond to the pandemic, but blatant racism that people should not ignore, let alone
condone.
The US president indulged in racist slurs during his 2016 election campaign, and now with his job approval
rating holding steady at a low level and the picture of the US' response to the novel coronavirus pandemic
looking increasingly bleak, blaming China to distract American public attention has become a strategy for the US
administration ahead of the presidential election scheduled for November.
Gallup polls in the past week showed that only 38 percent of Americans approve of the job the US president has
been doing while a new high of 65 percent of adults in the US say the pandemic situation in the country is
getting worse, contradicting what the US administration claims.
With more than 3 million COVID-19 cases and 131,000 deaths, the US is by far the worst-hit country, which
reflects its poor pandemic control and mitigation response. Many other economies, such as the European Union,
have effectively flattened, even lowered the curve after suffering a heavy blow. Yet the world's only superpower
continues to set single-day records - it registered more than 60,000 new cases on Tuesday.
That's why US politicians have intensified their attacks against China, often using racist language, in campaign

Asian Americans have started social media campaigns to combat the rise in racism they have faced amid the
coronavirus pandemic.
In a video released on Tuesday on several social media platforms, a group of Asians in face masks detailed the
discrimination, harassment and racism they have experienced - such as being told to ""go back to China"" or
having people cough at them or spit in their direction.
Pulling off their masks, they reveal their occupations as firefighter, nurse, doctor, delivery woman, bus driver
and other roles considered essential in the pandemic. The minute-long video is titled Fight the Virus. Fight the
Bias - the message they declare at its end.
The video, produced by the Advertising Council, a nonprofit organization that makes public service
announcements, and Emmy Award-winning writer Alan Yang, is aimed at building a sense of humanity and
breaking the silence around the hatred impacting the Asian-American community.
""Amid this pandemic and the stresses associated, nobody should have to also endure the added layer of fear
that comes from this surge in racial violence and harassment,"" said Advertising Council President and CEO Lisa
Sherman. She said she hoped the video would inspire US citizens to rethink their biases and help end the wave
of racism facing Asian Americans.

Like all parents, Ystein Mitchell worries for the safety of his child.
But as a Black man, he also has to worry whether his child will face racism for being biracial.
""It's sad that I have to tell my kid about racism and prejudiced people,"" Mitchell, 27, said.
Mitchell, an entrepreneur and brand owner, has a 5-year-old son and after a recent interaction with a neighbor
that his son witnessed, he had to tell him about racism.
""I had to explain to him that there's some people that may not like him, me or him, just solely because of our
skin color, or of our racial background or our religion. ... So, I explained to him ... not everybody's gonna like
you for who you are, some people are not gonna like the way you look but that doesn't matter.
""It doesn't change who you are, those people are the problem, not you.""
Mitchell described the experience as ""disheartening.""
""I'm more concerned about when he goes back to school, how he's going to be towards children that are
Caucasian because I don't want him thinking, which is what I told him, ... that all white people are bad, just
certain types of people that choose to live a racist and prejudiced life,"" the McSherrystown resident said.

Mitchell said this is especially important being that his son's mother and her family are white.
As Black Lives Matter protests have swept the nation in the recent months, many claim that racist issues don't
exist in small rural communities like Hanover and Gettysburg.
In response, some in these communities have stood up to unmask what life for a person of color in this area is
really like.
Latrecia Thomas, of Harrisburg, has Black sons, and she said that the Black Lives Matter movement occurring
today will hopefully pave the way for her children.
""Honestly, I hope that they don't have to scream out Black Lives Matter when they get older,"" the 29-year-old
said. ""That me saying it now ... and us working on it now, that this whole racial adversity is, for the most part,
gone by the time our children get older, so that they can live free and feel free.""
Black Lives Matter Protests: 'I want to be treated like a human'
To Thomas, Black Lives Matter has a very simple meaning.
""The gist ... is: 'Hi, we're here. I'm a person. I want to be treated like a human, I respect you, you respect me,'""
Thomas said.
The movement for her means community and a platform for Black people to share their grievances.
""It makes it all inclusive for all of us Black people to say your life does matter ... regardless of what your
circumstances are and regardless of what you've done. You don't deserve to be treated worse than anyone
else,"" Thomas said.
She attended recent protests in Harrisburg and Baltimore and said that she was able to have some very
enlightening conversations with people because of it.
""That's probably my favorite way to protest, especially if someone's open to that conversation because we have
to educate, we have to say like 'This is what I'm feeling and maybe you don't understand that because you
haven't taken the time to sit down and see that I had this real emotion behind that,'"" Thomas said.
She said she was happy to hear there were similar protests in Hanover, where she grew up.
Annie Henry, 24, was one of the organizers of the Black Lives Matter protest in Hanover on Sunday, May 31.
Now, in the COVID-19 pandemic, Asian Americans like herself have experienced discrimination from those
blaming the Asian community for the virus. Henry said that personal experience of being fearful of others
making racist remarks gave her a glimpse at what Black people deal with every day.
She believes that it's important for people to know what kind of action they can take regarding these national
issues.
""It is a privilege to not have to be involved in politics, a privilege that I could have if I chose not to, but I think
it's important that we use the privileges we do have to help those who might not. It shouldn't be left up to the
people who are oppressed to fix the systems that oppress them,"" Henry said.
She admitted she did have some reservations about organizing the protest in Hanover.
""If you look at the demographics of (Hanover), statistically, it is a very white town, and when there's a
homogeneous population, it's sometimes difficult to understand other experiences and other perspectives,""
Henry said.

""When we don't see diversity, when we don't have diverse thoughts, then the way that our town functions is
going to be from the white perspective. And that's not that people are being wrong, but it's understanding
that, and it's acknowledging that.""
Despite these reservations, ""I'm very happy we were able to do it peacefully and still impactfully.""
Henry also helped with the protest on Saturday, June 6, which was organized by the same person who
organized various recent protests in Gettysburg and Hanover, Matthew Anselmi.
Anselmi, of Gettysburg, is originally from Detroit where he said he lived in a poverty-stricken neighborhoods
with many Black families.
He said that from what he's seen on Facebook, many people think that the protests are just about George
Floyd's death and charging the officers involved, but it's about much more.
""Granted, this most recent slaying by the police is what has ignited worldwide protests, but it's just one
instance that speaks to hundreds of years of injustices and I think it's really important to get this message
out to rural America,"" the 31-year-old said.
He said that since organizing the protests, he and his family have received sexual assault and death threats
mostly on Facebook. While he said they have not filed any reports with police, he has provided police with
names of those that have threatened him and his family.
""Initially it was mind blowing, but it makes total sense. We're making an entire ideology uncomfortable, it's to
be expected. There's a lot of news on the national level that has painted all protesters as violent thugs so
people have been conditioned to respond a certain way, we are here to break these cycles,"" he said through
Facebook messenger.
Tori Gilbert, 24, of Gettysburg, said that when she saw the protest downtown she almost cried.
""Because I was like this is beautiful, I'm so glad to see so many people support it in this town because there
is also a lot of racism in this town."" she said.
Is there racism in small towns like Hanover, Gettysburg?
Thomas attended South Western High School in the Hanover area, and although she said she got a great
education, it was also the first place she experienced racism.
She described an instance where she and two of her friends, the only Black cheerleaders at the school, were
walking to a Wendy's when a man with a Confederate flag on the back of his truck drove by and called them
the ""n"" word.
""I was extremely taken aback because it was the first time I've ever had that happen to me. (My friend) had
been there longer than me and so had our other friends. They started telling me how they were used to
people doing it. I did go and report that to the principal and let them know, nothing was done about it,""
Thomas said.
She eventually saw the man again at a school dance.
""That's really where I learned to start reading more and start understanding how to say things to people
more because it wasn't being paid attention to, no one cared that people were calling us names and making
us not feel like we belonged,"" Thomas said.
Thomas not only experienced racism at school, but also in the community. She said that people would tell her
mother, an immigrant from Ghana who spoke with an accent, to ""go back to Africa,"" that her white friends'

parents wouldn't let her and her siblings play with them at their homes, and that managers at work would
often treat her differently than her white co-workers.
Thomas said that the racism she experienced in Hanover was why she left the area, ""because I just didn't
want to have to keep going through that as an adult.""
Mitchell is also the child of an immigrant, but his family came to the United States from St. Lucia, an island
in the Caribbean. He was born in Maryland, near the D.C., Maryland, Virginia triangle, where he said
there's a lot of diversity and because of that he never experienced racism or prejudice. Then he moved to
Pennsylvania.
""I started to see people with Confederate flags, really proud of waving Confederate flags and disrespecting
people or saying things (that are prejudiced). ... It seems like up here in Pennsylvania they're very proud
of that, some people are very proud of being ignorant,"" Mitchell said.
He also attended South Western, where he said he experienced racism.
Anselmi, a white man who grew up in a very diverse community, was shocked at the racism that he
witnessed once he moved to Hanover.
""When I first moved here, I remember being at the south Hanover Walmart and being in line and I was
caught in between two older white men, and they were just so openly using the 'n' word and just talking
(about Black people) like they are straight animals that need to be put down ... It completely blew my
mind that these people, not knowing who I am, were so comfortable with their racism."" Anselmi said.
Racism on social media
Though many people use platforms like Facebook to share information about the protests and the
movements, much of those posts are followed by backlash.
While he was organizing the Hanover protest, Anselmi said rumors on social media were circulating about a
bus of Black people going from Baltimore to Hanover.
He said the attention that rumor gained appalled him.
""Then I see their reaction to the idea of a few Black people being sent up here in buses, and they are
terrified. It's like the reaction was like, we're being threatened with an invasion from a hostile foreign
country,""; Anselmi said.
This was his reaction to this rumor, the events of which never actually occurred on the day of the protest:
First: ""They have their own mess down there and I'm sure that not too many people have the time to come
up to Hanover.""
Second: ""They just got national news recognition for a very peaceful protest that policemen partook in.""
Third: ""We are protesting for Black lives so if there does end up being a couple of buses from people that
live in Baltimore coming to support our cause then hallelujah. You know what I mean, like this is who we're
fighting for.""
Thomas said she has witnessed individuals from Hanover who regularly post ""racist memes, racist ideology,
racist rhetoric.""
While Thomas said it's OK for people not to agree about Black Lives Matter, it all comes down to respect.

""When it starts to becoming that you're making fun of Black Lives Matter, you compare Black people to
the planet of the apes so calling us animals themselves and saying that we need to basically shut up,
and that it's not true and that we just want attention. That is incorrect. ... It's just not right,"" Thomas
said.
Gilbert has also seen posts online from people who don't believe races should mix or who don't think
white privilege exists. At the end of the day, she said it's important for everyone to be knowledgeable
about the Black Lives Matter movement.
""I feel like everyone needs to be aware that there is a lot of racism still going on,"" Gilbert said.
'If we continue this way with all this racial intensity, we will fail as America'
Though much unrest has led to the Black Lives Matter protests, the movement also hopes to make
change for a better future.
""I hope the protests bring about vigilance and that people are on the lookout for things that aren't right
and that they're willing to stand up and say, 'I see this. Even though it's uncomfortable, it's not right.
And as an American, I'm going to say that's not welcome here,'"" Thomas said.
Thomas and Anselmi both also said they would like to see legislation passed against racism both from
the community and police.
Henry said she believes preventing racial injustice begins with education followed by action.
""I think the first part of it is understanding where you play a part in the problem and where you can
help. ... Then also getting involved with donating to organizations that are doing things like helping elect
more diverse government officials and helping to advocate for marginalized groups,"" she said.
""I also think that events like (the protests) get people to think about what's happening and to hold
ourselves and the organizations and businesses and things we're a part of accountable.""
Mitchell just hopes change comes in time for his son to live in a better world.
""I just hope in his lifetime that maybe there's some type of change and some type of shift in the culture
and people realize that (racism and prejudice) it's so just not the right thing to do, it's very ignorant.
And we need to really get a grip on social matters,"" Mitchell said.
""I hope that everybody can live and coexist equally, regardless of skin color, religion or creed.""
Thomas said she wants these protests to help end the treatment of Blacks as ""second class citizens.""
""I think that if we continue this way with all this racial intensity, we will fail as America, we will fail
because it takes all of us to run this country it takes all of us to do what needs to be done, and we owe
it to our children, not just our Black children but white children as well,"" Thomas said.
Amanda Beard-White, of Penn Township, is the executive director of the Hanover Diversity Alliance,
which is currently working to form a Human Relations Commission in Hanover Borough, Penn Township,
West Manheim, Conewago Township and McSherrystown Borough.
The commission would be able to work with police if someone made a discrimination complaint. It would
then review those complaints and decide what action would be taken either on the local or the state
level.
They would also work to remove old discriminatory laws from the books. For example, Beard-White said

202104,"
LOS ANGELES, July 2 (Xinhua) -- Asian Americans in California have self-reported 832 incidents of discrimination and harassment in the last three months, according to the new
data collected by a coalition of Asian American groups. 
Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate, the leading aggregator of incidents against Asian Americans during the pandemic, released the findings during a Wednesday virtual
conference. The Stop AAPI Hate reporting center was founded by the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action and San Francisco State
University's Asian American Studies Department. 
The incidents included 81 assaults and 64 potential civil rights violations. 
The new report shows that incidents of racism and discrimination are not isolated to any particular area but are a statewide problem in California as Asian Americans have
reported incidents in 34 counties so far in the most populous state of the United States, adding that incidents are reportedly taking place in California in retail stores, in the
workplace and online. 
""Anti-Asian American harassment has also been further stoked by President Trump's repeated use of the term 'Kung Flu' in recent rallies, and as recently as last night,
comments on Twitter scapegoating China for the United States' devastating failure to control the coronavirus,"" said the groups in a statement. 
They noted that discrimination and harassment of Asian Americans in California has drawn national attention recently after a series of videos in Torrance, California featured a
woman using graphic racist language against Asian Americans. 
""The viral video of racism in Torrance is one example of hundreds. It's the tip of the iceberg of anti-Asian American hate and discrimination,"" said Russell Jeung, Chair and
Professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University. ""Without government accountability, we risk COVID-related racism against Asian Americans becoming
deeply entrenched, ultimately impacting the lives of millions of people in California and around the country."" 
""Racist demagoguery matched with anti-immigrant policies have always been used to deny Asian Americans full social and political rights,"" said Cynthia Choi, co-executive
director of Chinese for Affirmative Action. 
""In California, we have to do more than condemn racist rhetoric - we must take bold action today to address attacks whether they happen in grocery stores, in the workplace or
in the schoolyard,"" Choi added. 
Stop AAPI Hate sent a letter to California governor Gavin Newsom Tuesday night to recommend the establishment of a Racial Bias Strike Team comprised of key state agencies
and departments to oversee workplace and employment discrimination, provide mental health services to vulnerable communities, and offer support to local Asian American-
serving organizations.

As the coronavirus first reported in China now ravages the U.S., Asian Americans are continuing to wrestle with a second epidemic: hate. Hundreds of attacks on Asian people
have been reported, with few signs of decline. 
Asian Americans in California reported 832 incidents of discrimination and harassment in the last three months, according to the new data collected by ""Stop Asian American
Pacific Islander Hate,"" the leading aggregator of incidents against Asian Americans during the pandemic. 
The incidents included 81 assaults and 64 potential civil rights violations.

Meanwhile, Asian Americans in New York have been helping themselves confronted with the increase of targeted hate crimes by equipped themselves with GoPros and guns. 
When Eddie Song leaves his Manhattan home, it can feel like heading into battle. The Korean American startup founder and avid rider dons his armored motorcycle jacket,
motorcycle gloves, a skull face mask and a GoPro camera. 
""The GoPro is on all the time whenever I leave the house now. Basically it's a rolling camera,"" Song said. ""With the combination of looking intimidating and having the camera –
if they pick a fight with me, they know I'm prepared."" 
During the pandemic, an online hate reporting center has received nearly 1,500 reports of racist abuse against Asians nationwide since it launched March 19. Stay-at-home
orders mean in-person run-ins are down somewhat but vandalism of Asian-owned homes and businesses is up, according to the advocacy groups running the portal. 
It's difficult to predict whether incidents will dramatically drop once society goes back to ""normal,"" Levin, a former NYPD officer, said, noting that the pandemic is
unprecedented. 
""Generally, when there's a catalytic event, hate crimes tend to decline and have a bit of a half-life,"" he said. ""But that presupposes a singular catalytic event as opposed to a
rolling one.""

About four in 10 black American and Asian American adults surveyed say people have acted uncomfortably around them because of their race or ethnicity since the beginning of
the Covid-19 outbreak, according to a new Pew Research Centre survey.
Only 13 per cent of white adults say this has happened to them.
Asians have borne the brunt of racist reactions; about three in 10 Asian adults (31 per cent) say they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their race or ethnicity since
the outbreak began, compared with 21 per cent of black adults, 15 per cent of Hispanic adults and 8 per cent of white adults.
The findings are not out of line with reports of incidents of discrimination against Asian Americans since the coronavirus outbreak first emerged in China and then spread in the
United States.
Against a background of intensifying pushback by the US against China, Beijing's actions - or lack of them - in the initial stages of the pandemic have become a domestic
political issue in the US, with President Donald Trump blaming China as he campaigns for re-election. The President has even used the term ""kung flu"" - widely considered
derogatory - twice, although the White House has said the term merely underlines the origin of the coronavirus.
Pew Research surveyed 9,654 American adults from June 4 to 10 for the study on personal experiences with racial and ethnic discrimination since the beginning of the
coronavirus outbreak, and opinions about whether racist views towards different groups have become more common.
Everyone who took part is a member of Pew Research's American Trends Panel, an online survey panel recruited through a national, random sampling of residential addresses.
The survey is weighted to be representative of the US' adult population by gender, race, ethnicity, partisan affiliation, education and other categories.
However, as the survey included a total sample size of 278 Asian Americans, and English-speaking Asian Americans only, it may not be representative of the overall Asian
American population, Pew Research said.
Asian Americans, who account for 6 per cent of the US population, are the fastest growing major racial or ethnic group in the country. Hispanics make up 18 per cent of the
population overall, while Black Americans are 12 per cent,
The survey also found that a majority of Asian adults (58 per cent - more than black or Hispanic adults) say it is now more common for people to express racist or racially
insensitive views about people who are Asian than it was before the coronavirus outbreak.
31%
Proportion of Asian Americans who say they have been subject to slurs or jokes because of their race or ethnicity since the outbreak began - compared with 21 per cent of black
adults, 15 per cent of Hispanic adults and 8 per cent of white adults.
It also found 42 per cent of black Americans and 36 per cent of Asian Americans saying they worry a great deal or a fair amount that other people might be suspicious of them
because of their race or ethnicity if they wear a mask or face covering when in stores or other businesses.
In contrast, 23 per cent of Hispanics and just 5 per cent of white adults say they worry about this.
Black Americans had mixed experiences though, with many experiencing more support in the wake of the May 25 death of African American George Floyd while he was
restrained by a police officer, which ignited nationwide outrage across ethnic groups.

A 15-year-old boy has been charged by the London Metropolitan Police over his alleged involvement in a racially
aggravated assault on Singaporean student Jonathan Mok in London.
A police spokesman said the boy was charged with wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm without intent
and will appear at Highbury Corner Magistrates' Court on Aug 10.
The police added that a 16-year-old boy who was arrested on March 4 in connection with the case has been
released with no further action taken against him.
On March 3, Mr Mok, 23, opened up on Facebook about the attack, which took place in Oxford Street near the
London Underground's Tottenham Court Road train station.
The University College London law student said he heard a group of young people say ""coronavirus"" as he
walked past them at about 9.15pm on Feb 24.
When he turned to face the group, he was punched in the face, with one of the suspects saying ""I don't want
your coronavirus in my country"" before the group fled.
The incident resulted in Mr Mok having to go for facial surgery, reported Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao.

From being told you’re “too pretty to be Aboriginal” to being blamed for COVID-19, three women on the
receiving end of racial abuse share their experiences with Dilvin Yasa.
It’s the land of mateship and fair go, but Australian academics have been documenting some disturbing factors
where minority groups are concerned.
According to the University of Western Sydney’s Challenging Racism Project, one in three people experienced
racism in the workplace in 2015-16, while a 2013 study published in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence found
seven in 10 students experienced or observed racism during their childhood.
Professor Tim Soutphommasane, Australia’s race discrimination commissioner from 2013 to 2018 and the author
of On Hate, says that while we’re seeing a global anti-racism moment, with people across the world talking and
thinking about racism with a new level of seriousness, racism is on the rise on home ground. “Bodies such as
the Australian Human Rights Commission and some state anti-discrimination bodies have received a higher
number of complaints about racial discrimination,” he explains. “There has been a spike in racial hostility
directed at people from Asian backgrounds in particular.”
This isn’t a matter of “hurt feelings”, or that people who are targets of racial taunts are delicate or sensitive,

Soutphommasane adds.
“There’s a large amount of research that shows the psychological, even physiological, effects of racism on
people’s wellbeing; it can diminish a person and sap them of their dignity.
People who aren’t from minority backgrounds don’t always understand the damage it can cause.” Lee Lin Chin
was the first person I idolised, because of everything she represented. With her media career, quirky wardrobe
and short hair, not only was she the antithesis of the ‘typical’ Asian mould of that ladylike woman with the long,
glossy hair, but she was visible to mainstream Australia at a time when minority groups were invisible on screen.
“When you’re Asian, there are all these expectations you’ll be good with numbers or work in medicin. But I was
passionate about drama and the arts. Square peg, round hole.
I grew up in an environment where it wasn’t unusual to have people scream ‘Go back to your own country’ as
you’re going about your business.
That’s sad in itself but one of the things that’s been concerning me lately is the fetishisation of Asian women.
I’ve been stalked on trains by masturbating men and once I was followed home by a guy who kept asking, ‘Are
you an accountant? Do you work in finance?’ It happens in the workplace, too; earlier in my career, I remember
one of my company directors picking me up and swinging me around as he told me how much he loves Asian
women. It’s a strange fixation that’s rooted in male dominance and white supremacy.
The COVID-19 era has brought to light an overt form of racism I haven’t experienced for a long time. Recently I
was standing in line at Aldi with my four-year-old son and, even though I was following social-distancing
guidelines, the woman in front turned around and spat, ‘Maintain social distancing because you are Asian.’
I told her that I was born here and that I didn’t personally cause the virus, but it fell on deaf ears. I understand
it’s a time of fear for everyone but that incident has really shaken me. I’ve been anxious about going out in
public and I ask myself, ‘Do people see me, or do they see “generic Asian spreading disease”?’ It’s a terrible way
to live.
I don’t think Australia is more racist than other countries but I think we believe we’re a lot more tolerant than
we really are. This is a country filled with citizens who think nothing of saying, ‘Oh, you speak really good
English’ to someone with a broad Aussie accent. And ‘I don’t normally like Asians but you’re pretty nice’, and
then laughing it off as some kind of joke. As a stand-up comedian [Ngo is a member of the Tight 5 Comedy
group], I can tell you with some experience that ‘casual racism’ is no laughing matter.”
“MOST OF THE RACISM I’VE EXPERIENCED HAS COME FROM OTHER RECENT ARRIVALS“ Maie Sufan, a “40-
something” engineer and support relations co-ordinator for Islamic Relief Australia, moved to Australia from her
native Syria in 2006.
“When I moved to Australia for love, I left behind a very successful life as an engineer and lecturer. It was hard
to leave my country but even though I wasn’t sure about how different things would be culturally in Australia, I
wasn’t too worried. I knew it to be a multicultural nation and Australians have a reputation overseas for being
friendly and inclusive. I felt welcomed as soon as I landed.
When you wear a headscarf you get used to people openly staring, but while I’ve had my share of ‘f…ing Muslim’
comments in the streets, I’ve only ever had two major incidents where the behaviour has been extreme.
The first time was not long after I arrived, when a woman in her 50s followed me around a shopping centre
screaming in my face about why I was in ‘her country’. She yelled, ‘We have a stupid government letting stupid
Muslims like you into our country.’

She was aggressive and intimidating.
The second time was at the Royal Sydney Easter Show when I picked up an egg in the barn, not knowing this
was something I was not allowed to do, and a man nearby began screaming at me. He was annoyed about
the egg but made his argument about my religion, background and about people not understanding where
they belong.
Both times I held my ground and defended my right to be in Australia but these experiences are infuriating.
Yes, of course it’s their country but it’s my country, too. What’s more, I love this country by choice.
Over the years I’ve discovered that the people who think it’s okay to make hurtful comments are not
necessarily who you think they might be. Most of the racism I’ve experienced over the last 14 years has come
from those with different cultural backgrounds and other recent arrivals to this country.
By contrast, the majority of ‘typical’ Australians have been very friendly and accepting and I’ve made some
lovely friends. When the Lindt Cafe situation unfolded in 2014, people went out of their way to ensure I was
okay and that I remained safe. I think two major incidents and a handful of comments in 14 years isn’t
unreasonable.
The biggest problem with racism in our country is that the poison often trickles from the top down. It seems
as though if anyone wants to be successful in politics in Australia, they have to start spouting hate speech
about other cultures. These are our leaders and our role models, and if we’re learning how to treat our fellow
Australians from them, we’re going to be in big trouble moving forward.” “Born to a proud Wadjanbarra Yidinji
and Jirrbal mother and an African- American father, I often refer to myself as ‘double black’. It took me years
to claim that identity because so much of my childhood was spent figuring out who I was.
When we moved to the States, I was told I couldn’t identify as black because I had ‘lighter skin and good
hair’. To them, I was mixed. When we moved back to Australia, when I was 10, it was just as strange. I didn’t
grow up on country and didn’t look like my extended family. As a kid I didn’t feel Aboriginal enough and I
grew up confused about what being black even meant.
I was 11 when I first heard the words ‘You’re too pretty to be Aboriginal’, and that’s the moment I realised
being Aboriginal was considered dirty, like no good can come of it. Over the years, there have been others:
‘You’re not like the rest’, ‘You’re too articulate’ and ‘You could pass yourself off as Brazilian – that’s much
better.’
There is this view that I should be happy by my proximity to whiteness, as though assimilation is something
I’m trying desperately to achieve, but people don’t realise comments like that perpetuate genocide on my
culture. In efforts to explore my Aboriginality and beauty I created the documentary Too Pretty to Be
Aboriginal, which screened in 2019 on NITV Our Stories.
When there’s hate bubbling up around you, there’s also a level of internal racism you experience. I was raised
with messages like, ‘You’re black so you have to work twice as hard.’ And, ‘Don’t behave in a way that can be
deemed as too urban or show too much attitude lest you’re labelled aggressive.’ You learn to present yourself
in a way that’s socially acceptable for the masses but it’s at the cost of your identity.
When I started my magazine, Ascension, I wanted it to be a one-stop shop for women of colour but since the
Black Lives Matter protests began, I’ve noticed a significant shift in the demographic of my readership.
For the first time ever, people from all backgrounds are coming to us, eager to embrace diversity. And while
one part of me feels like shouting, ‘Yes! This is the opportunity we’ve been waiting for’, another part can’t
help wondering if we’re just a trend. Is it Black Lives Matter today and then something else tomorrow? I’m
opting to remain positive.

Hurt. Angry. Unsafe.
That's how Jasmine Yuan says she felt in March when a stranger in a car yelled “corona!” at her while driving by
in a grocery store parking lot in North Austin.
Yuan, 39, said she loves Austin and considers it a diverse, multicultural city, but lamented that she now fears
portions of town that used to be part of her everyday life. After the incident, Yuan said she has avoided public
places that she feels might put her at risk of being targeted again.
“I feel scared and intimidated. I just don’t want to have this experience happen again,” Yuan said.
Racist verbal and physical attacks have been reported at growing rates around the country since March,
according to people who have started tracking the trend nationally.

And local Asian American community leaders like Hugh Li, president of the education and philanthropy group
Austin Chinese American Network, fear anti-Asian attitudes tied to the coronavirus pandemic could stick around
long after the pandemic and worsen due to waning U.S.-China relations and economic hardship.
“I think this will naturally put Asian Americans, and particularly Chinese Americans, in a really bad bind,” he
said.
Li said his organization
recently circulated a survey asking its hundreds of members to report incidents of racism they have witnessed
or experienced during the pandemic, and it has so far have received two reports.
Yuan, who moved to the U.S. 13 years ago and has lived in Austin with her husband and two children since
2011, responded to the survey. She said she did not immediately report her experience at the grocery store,
hoping it had been an isolated incident.
“But if more and more of this happens, this becomes a trend,” Yuan said. “That makes me think that I need to
stand up and talk about this.”
Austin resident Jae Kwon, 35, who is Korean American, said he was the target of several aggressions that he
suspects were motivated by race.
Kwon, a University of Texas sociology doctoral student who has lived in Austin since 2015, said something was
thrown at him, a woman screamed something inaudible from a car, and a stranger yelled obscenities at him
during a six-day span in May while he was running for exercise. On another occasion, Kwon said a person
sprayed him with a water gun while driving by.
“It’s unusual in the sense that things like this had not happened other times,” said Kwon, who also served 12
years in the U.S. Navy. “I can only think that these are unrelated incidents, but it’s related in the sense that it
happened in this time period.”
G. Michael Pendon, 43, a local DJ, reported that a group of men harassed him using anti-Chinese and
homophobic slurs while he was riding a bicycle through a neighborhood near the UT campus July 18.
Pendon, whose parents came to the U.S. from the Philippines in the 1960s, said he could not sleep that night.
“I was pissed off. I was tired. I felt like I needed to go down there. I was kind of obsessed about trying to figure
this out,” he said.
Austin police have confirmed that they are investigating the matter. Pendon said he has also spoken to the UT
Police Department.
""I just want to identify these perpetrators,"" Pendon said.
Resurfacing biases
Experts in the field of Asian American history say racial violence and tensions during events like a pandemic are
not a new phenomenon.
Russell Jeung, chair of Asian American studies at San Francisco State University, said the pandemic has
reignited old, yet lingering anti-Asian sentiments in the West.
“There is a historical stereotype on Asians — the yellow peril — that they are a threat that would come dominate
the West with their hordes and their diseases,” Jeung said.

Jeung helped start Stop AAPI Hate, an online system in which people across the country can report racially
charged incidents against Asian Americans through a form translated into more than 10 languages.
“We launched it, and immediately we got flooded with responses, and using the data we’ve been sharing it
with local jurisdictions,” Jeung said.
Jeung said that, from March 19 through July 1, the organization received more than 2,120 reports of racially
motivated attacks against Asian Americans from across the country.
In more than 500 cases, Jeung said people reported being told to go back to China. One respondent from
Austin said they were told to go back to their country by a person who used a racial epithet to describe the
coronavirus.
A relatively small number of cases — 63 incidents — were from Texas, but reports came from every major
Texas city. About 22% of those reports involved physical attacks, more than double the national rate, Jeung
said. About 63% of reported attacks in Texas were verbal.
People of Chinese descent are not the only segment of the Asian American population targeted since the
pandemic started. On March 14, three people of Burmese descent, including 2- and 6-year-old children, were
attacked in the West Texas city of Midland by a man with a knife.
Jeung said Trump's rhetoric on China makes Asian Americans more vulnerable to racist attacks.
According to Factba.se, an independent online database of words from Trump’s speeches, media interviews
and tweets, the president used the term “China Virus” or “Chinese Virus” a total of eight times between
March and April, not including instances in which he blamed China for the pandemic without using those
terms.
In July alone, the database showed that Trump used different variations of the phrase at least 32 times.
""Trump makes the connection that the virus is Chinese, but he also normalizes the hate,"" Jeung said.
Jeung said the news media's framing of discussions and depictions of the pandemic, especially in its early
days, also has eroded the image of the Asian community in the country.
In addition to referring to the pathogen as the “Wuhan Virus,” many news organizations frequently ran clips
and images of people of East Asian descent wearing face masks, Jeung said.
“We all have implicit biases, and we have fight or flight responses,” Jeung said. “During the pandemic people
are fearful, and when they’re fearful, they automatically respond.”
A local group called the Austin Asian Community Health Initiative in May started a reporting system for
pandemic-related racist aggressions, and is working with Austin Public Health to track the data. Though the
organization has not yet received any local reports, Executive Director Hailey Easley said she believes the tool
will be useful in tracking racism well after the pandemic.
“I actually see this opening up,” Easley said. “I imagine that this could be helpful beyond COVID-19, and it
could be helpful for people of all ethnicities and all races.”
Local response
Amy Wong Mok, an established activist in the local Asian community, has been informing Mayor Steve Adler
and Austin Police Chief Brian Manley about racist incidents she has heard about.

In March, Mok, along with representatives from the Asian American Quality of Life Advisory Commission,
alerted city officials about rising anti-Asian racism amid the pandemic.
Mok said she heard multiple accounts of people being verbally harassed in March, and more recently,
reported that an Asian food supply company had three of its trucks vandalized.
Mok said she will continue to push city leaders to raise awareness and investigate reported incidents.
“No matter how long we’ve been here, no matter how much we contribute to society, we’re still viewed as
outsiders,” Mok said.
The Austin City Council in April unanimously passed a resolution condemning racism and hate speech
against Asian Americans.
Adler told the American-Statesman that city officials will continue working to address anti-Asian racism in
the city.
“Austin is no place for hate. We will continue to do all we can — in every way we can — to help make sure
that all our neighbors feel safe,” Adler said in a written statement. “We can’t prevent all this behavior but
we can shine light on it, condemn and make clear it is not tolerated in Austin.”
Alice Yi, president of the Austin chapter of the Asian Pacific Islander American Public Affairs, said political
participation can fight the stereotype that Asian Americans are perpetual foreigners.
Yi said her organization is working to get more people registered to vote in the November elections and
has helped people in the Asian American community fill out the 2020 census.
“If we have a huge amount of representation, maybe we cannot be scapegoated so easily,” Yi said. “If we
have a larger head count, we might have more representation politically and have more power to speak
out and speak louder.”

Businesses in Manhattan's Chinatown have been struggling to survive because of coronavirus-related restrictions and a racial
stigma against Asians in the US.
Chinatown small businesses reported losses between 60% to 80% in February and March.
Local organizations are helping them raise funds and set up temporary outdoor dining spaces.
View more episodes of Business Insider Today on Facebook.
Small businesses in Manhattan's Chinatown have survived weeklong closures following disasters like 9/11 and Hurricane
Sandy. But those hard times don't compare to the months of dwindling business the neighborhood is experiencing from the
coronavirus pandemic.
Chinatown small businesses report losses of 60% to 80% as early as February from a decline of customers that happened
before New York City's first confirmed COVID-19 case and the city's mandatory lockdown in March.
""Since there is a misunderstanding that the virus was brought to the US from China, a lot of people did not want to be in or
around Chinatown, or even eat Chinese food,"" said Chuen Ping Hui, owner and executive chef of Ping's seafood restaurant.
While New York recently lifted its restrictions on outdoor dining, Chinatown restaurants are still contending with a lack of
visitors.
""New York City now, it's quite clear that we no longer have the 66 million visitors from international tourism,"" said Wellington
Chen, executive director of Chinatown Partnership.
The organization helps maintain cleanliness and safety in the neighborhood, which are more necessary than ever.

""The demand on you is higher because of the additional cost of the shield, the masks, the sanitizers, the air filtration, HEPA
equipment that has never been in your formula,"" Chen said. ""And that's never in your budget, but meantime, your customers
are down this much.""
To attract customers, the nonprofit Chinatown Partnership has been helping Ping's and other local businesses set up outdoor
seating arrangements for the summer, in the form of collapsible tents, tables, chairs, and planters.
Ping's is one of the area's small businesses that operates on thin profit margins and relies on a steady stream of both locals
and tourists. When that stream dropped off in mid-March, Hui made a tough decision.
""Once March 15 came around, the business for March was down by 80%. I did not see a future,"" Hui said. ""Chinatown was
quiet. I had no choice but to [temporarily] close the business.""
After a three-month closure, Ping's reopened in early June with delivery and takeout service only. But the setup was less than
ideal for a fine-dining restaurant accustomed to serving as many as 150 people indoors. The restaurant added a small outdoor
space in late June, but it only fits around 20 diners, and it's often empty on weekdays.
Amid the pandemic and an economic downturn, Asian Americans are fighting racism and a stigma that they're to blame for the
virus.
In March, the FBI warned of a rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans. And since March 19, the website Stop AAPI Hate
has received 2,373 anonymous incident reports of hate and discrimination toward Asians in the US.
The Stop AAPI Hate reporting center found that verbal harassment makes up 70% to 80% of the incidents and there's been a
rise in physical incidents, such as spitting or coughing on Asian people.
""We shifted really quickly from being 'crazy rich Asians' and the 'model minority' to being 'crazy infected Asians' and being the
perpetual foreigner,"" said Russell Jeung, founder of Stop AAPI Hate and chair of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State
University.
As Chinatown suffers, hate crimes against Asians are rising in the US.
President Donald Trump has reinforced the harmful racial stigma by saying ""Kung flu"" and ""China virus"" when referring to
COVID-19.
""The president's insistence on using the term 'Chinese virus' really makes the situation worse,"" Jeung said. ""We noticed that
after he began to repeatedly use that term, a clear spike in hate speech circulating on the internet and acts of violence against
Asian Americans.""
Chen, the Chinatown Partnership and Chinatown BID director, said the attacks threaten not just Chinese people, but all Asians.
""Unfortunately you have a ripple effect affecting Malaysians, Singaporeans, Vietnamese, people from the Philippines,"" he said.
""As long as you have an Asian face, you then become associated with this virus.""
The stigma has been detrimental to Asian American small businesses: 233,000 have closed across the country from February
to April, a loss of 28%.
To support small businesses in their neighborhood, Victoria Lee and Jennifer Tam started the grassroots organization Welcome
to Chinatown in March. The organization has several initiatives, including a partnership with small businesses to create and sell
merchandise, with revenue going directly back to the businesses.
""Chinatown doesn't need saving in the sense that there's an impassioned community,"" Lee said. ""We're only one of a handful
of different grassroots initiatives that have come out of the pandemic.""
One of its early fundraisers, Feed Our Heroes, involved purchasing meals from local eateries and delivering them to essential
workers. The group has served more than 16,000 meals in 11 weeks.
To extend assistance beyond food-related businesses, Welcome to Chinatown ended that program in June and recently
launched the Longevity Fund, a $200,000 fundraiser to alleviate overhead costs for 40 small local businesses.

Four prominent Asian Americans says prejudice, racism and physical attacks against their community have
increased at alarming rates over assertions that Chinese people are responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic.
""Whenever there is a contentious relationship with any part of Asia from the United States, the racism inside the
United States goes up against Asians,"" said Jerry Yang, co-founder and former chief executive of Yahoo! ""We are
at such a moment, in my belief.""
Yang made his remarks at a virtual event organized by the National Committee on United States-China Relations
on Wednesday. He was joined by Anla Cheng, founder and chief executive of SupChina; Erika Lee, a professor of
American history and director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota; and
Nancy Yao Maasbach, president of the Museum of Chinese in America.
Between March and June 2,100 anti-Asian American hate crimes related to COVID-19 were committed, Chinese
advocacy groups say, 10 percent of them physical.
In Brooklyn, New York, a Chinese American woman, 89, was set on fire by two men. The woman had just left
her home on July 14 when the men slapped her in the face and set her clothes on fire. She was able to rub her
back against a wall to put out the flames but suffered burns.

FOND DU LAC - The case against a man charged with killing a retired police officer by hitting him with his pickup
truck could combine two rare elements in a Wisconsin court case: a hate-crime charge and an insanity defense.
Prosecutors say the killing of retired police officer Phillip A. Thiessen, 55, of Fond du Lac is a hate crime because
Thiessen was targeted because of his race — Thiessen was white and defendant Daniel Navarro, a Mexican-
American, told police he intended to kill a white person.
Statements Navarro is accused of making to police immediately after the crash — unless his attorney can get a
judge to throw them out — would likely eliminate several potential defenses.
""Navarro stated he intentionally crashed into the motorcycle, head-on,"" District Attorney Eric Toney said in a
criminal complaint. Fond du Lac County Sheriff's Sgt. Logan Will, who spoke with Navarro minutes after the July
3 crash, said Navarro told him, ""It was intentional, sir.""
Navarro's truck left no skid marks or other signs he tried to avoid Thiessen before a head-on collision on
Winnebago Drive in Taycheedah, the complaint says. There is no evidence the two knew each other before the
crash.
Prosecutors also say Navarro said white people had been harassing him, ""giving him acid"" and contaminated
him with a chemical sterilizer.

Navarro, 27, is charged with first-degree intentional homicide with a deadly weapon as a hate crime, and first-
degree recklessly endangering safety with a dangerous weapon, as a hate crime. He is in Fond du Lac County
Jail in lieu of $1 million bond.
Navarro is due in county circuit court on Wednesday for arraignment.
The law since 1988
Hate-crimes — crimes motivated by bigotry — became illegal under a measure the state Legislature adopted in
1988.
Then Rep. David Clarenbach, D-Madison, authored the bill after incidents including cross burnings, the painting
of a swastika on a synagogue and the killing of a white woman walking in a mall parking lot with a Black man,
according to a 1988 report in the Janesville Gazette.
""If a man is assaulted because he is Black,"" Clarenbach said, ""the penalty for assault should be enhanced to
reflect the intimidation connected with the crime.""
Hate crimes ""enhancers,"" as they are known, allow increased fines and prison time for crimes that target people
because of race and ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability or gender. A judge can add up to $5,000,
and/or an additional five years in prison to the sentence of someone convicted of a hate-crime felony.
Race and ethnicity remain the most common reasons for hate crimes in the state, and in the nation, statistics
show.
Nationally, the FBI says, Blacks were the targets of 1,943 hate crimes in 2018 — more than any other race,
figures show. Next are whites, at 762, and Latinos, at 485.
Perhaps the state's best-known hate crime is the August 2012 mass shooting at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin in
Oak Creek, near Milwaukee. A white supremacist killed six people, including four priests, and wounded four
others before killing himself after being shot by an Oak Creek police officer.
Another victim, paralyzed in the attack, died earlier this year.
Today, though, Wisconsin's hate-crime cases remain fairly rare, U.S. Justice Department figures show.
Since 2014, when 51 were reported, the numbers declined for two years, then nudged back up to 46 in 2017,
and rose again to 53 in 2018, the most recent year for which figures were available.
Hate crimes, insanity defense
When he spoke to deputies at the crash scene, and detectives later that night, Navarro told sheriff's officials he
hadn't nodded off at the wheel. Nor did he claim Thiessen was riding in a way that would have caused Navarro
to think he needed to defend himself against the motorcyclist, based on what witnesses told police.
That limits his options in terms of a criminal defense, meaning his best defense might involve employing an
""insanity defense"" — making the case about his mental condition.
That approach — pleading not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, commonly labeled an ""insanity
defense"" or ""NGI"" — is available, but rarely used. Black's Law Dictionary says it's employed in less than 1% of
Wisconsin criminal cases.
Defense Attorney Jeffrey Jensen wasn't available for comment but had indicated after a brief court proceeding in
July that he might consider a defense based on Navarro's mental health.
In an insanity defense, the defendant must admit he or she committed the crime. A defense attorney must then

convince the court that his client couldn't understand his actions were wrong, and couldn't stop himself from
committing the crime.
The defense could also convince a court the defendant knew his actions were wrong but couldn't ""conform his
conduct to the law"" — something Marquette University Law Professor Michael O'Hear called ""the irresistible
impulse.""
At trial, both sides will call expert witnesses who've examined the defendant. The defense's expert will likely
testify that the defendant should be found not guilty because of his mental condition and the prosecution's
will disagree.
Even then, a successful insanity defense won't necessarily keep a defendant from being locked up for a long
time. Defendants who are found guilty, but not responsible, are typically confined to a psychiatric institution,
not released into the community or sent to prison. And in Wisconsin cases where a jury accepts an insanity
defense, a judge can reject that finding.
Kenneth Freeman of Milwaukee was found not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect this year for killing
Froedtert Hospital nurse practitioner Carlie Beaudin, 33, as she walked to her car after a 2019 shift at the
hospital. A judge in Milwaukee County sentenced Freeman in March to spend the rest of his life in a secure
mental facility.
Wisconsin's best known — and perhaps only — hate-crime case to employ an insanity defense resulted in
three life sentences plus 20 years for a Milwaukee County man who gunned down neighbors Phia and Mai Vue
and Jesus Manso-Perez, and tried to kill a fourth in a racially motivated attack. Jurors rejected Dan Popp's
claim that mental illness kept him from acting lawfully.
Insanity-defense cases usually involve testimony about the defendant's mental health over time. Should
Navarro employ such a defense, it could pose challenges.
As USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reported in July, Navarro's family, a prosecutor, and a judge had raised
concerns in the past about Navarro's mental state. But while multiple people raised red flags, there was little
immediate evidence that he had undergone an evaluation.
His sister in 2019 had described him to Fond du Lac police as a germophobe who wouldn't pick something up
without paper towels or toilet paper in his hands. Another relative told authorities a doctor had recommended
he have a mental health evaluation. And the Fond du Lac County circuit judge overseeing his 2019 disorderly-
conduct case had ordered a psychological evaluation.
But when one a test was not conducted in the time called for under law, the judge released Navarro from jail
and withdrew the order.

Recent Wisconsin hate crimes
Wisconsin has seen some hate-driven crimes of violence recently. Some exhibit an element of pre-planning.
Milwaukee resident Clifton Blackwell, 62, is set for trial in November on a felony charge of first-degree
reckless injury as a hate crime. Prosecutors say he threw acid in the face of 42-year-old U.S. citizen Mahud
Villalaz outside a Milwaukee restaurant last fall after making anti-immigrant remarks and accusing Villalaz of
""invading"" the U.S.
Villalaz suffered facial burns. He has recovered.

years
Stranded abroad by the coronavirus pandemic and squeezed by political tensions, Chinese students in the United States
are rethinking their host and home countries.
Eight years ago, Shizheng Tie, then aged 13, moved alone from China to rural Ohio for one sole purpose: education. She
once had a budding American dream, but now she says she is facing hostility in that country.
“As a Chinese living in the US, I am very scared now,” she says. Tie, now a senior student at Johns Hopkins University,
describes America as “anti-China” and “chaotic”.
Some 360,000 Chinese students are currently enrolled in schools in the US. In the past months, they have experienced
two historical events – a global pandemic and unprecedented tensions between the US and China, which have reshaped
their views of the two nations.
‘Politicised’ and ‘anxious’
The majority of Chinese students in the US are self-funded and hope their western education will lead to a good career.
Meanwhile, Washington has warned that not all students from China are “normal”, claiming some are Beijing’s proxies
who conduct economic espionage, orchestrate pro-China views and monitor other Chinese students on American

campuses.
The Trump administration recently cancelled visas for 3,000 students they believe have ties to the Chinese military. One
US senator even suggested that Chinese nationals should be banned from studying math and science in America.
Amid the harsh rhetoric, many Chinese students fear that they are being turned into a political target for Washington.
Tie, majoring in environmental science, says she is pessimistic about her academic future in the US, given the growing
scrutiny over Chinese students and scholars in science and technology.
“I used to think I’d pursue my PhD in the US and perhaps settle down here, but now I see myself returning to China
after obtaining a master’s degree,” Tie says.
Yingyi Ma, associate professor of sociology at Syracuse University, says Chinese students in the US are now “politicised
and marginalised at an unprecedented level”, as Washington is sending “very unfriendly signals”.
The strained bilateral relations have swayed public opinion, as a recent survey found that 73% of American adults have
an unfavourable view of China – an historic high.
Prof Ma published a book called Ambitious and Anxious this January, focusing on Chinese students’ experience in
America.
“If I write the book now, I will only keep ‘anxious’ in the title,” she says.
‘Unwanted’ at home
As the coronavirus continues to spread in the US, Tie prefers to return to China, where the outbreak appears to be
largely under control.
But the country has ordered sharp cuts in international flights to prevent imported cases, leaving many Chinese students
overseas, stranded thousands of miles away from their families.
On Chinese social media, some comments portrayed these students as spoiled brats, who had fled from the country’s
fiercely competitive education system and now may imperil its success in containing the virus.
“America wants to kick us out, while China doesn’t allow us to return,” Tie says.
This sentiment is commonly shared among Chinese students in the US.
Iris Li, a 20-year-old junior student from China at Emory University in Atlanta, describes the students as “being kicked
like a ball” between the two countries.
“We are getting the short end of the stick from both sides,” Li says.
Racism ‘boosts’ support for Beijing
After worrying about the outbreak in their home country from afar, these young Chinese are now witnessing the
coronavirus crisis in the US.
They were perplexed by the cultural differences regarding mask-wearing. They were unsettled by President Trump’s use
of the phrases “kung flu” and “China virus”. Some have even experienced racial harassment firsthand.
Racial discrimination during the pandemic has “burst their bubble,” Prof Ma says.
A new paper stated that anti-Chinese racism boosts support for Beijing’s authoritarian rule among Chinese students in
the US.

Jennifer Pan, co-author of the paper and assistant professor of Communications at Stanford University, says there is a
general belief that Chinese students overseas are indoctrinated to wholeheartedly support the Chinese Communist
Party.
“That’s not the case,” Prof Pan says, “What does change their political views is racism.”
The research found that college freshmen from China who read derogatory comments against Chinese people are
more likely to support Beijing, while general criticism against the government’s coronavirus handling did not produce
the same effects.
Prof Pan says the findings suggest that Chinese students in the US, whose survey responses are “mature,
sophisticated and thoughtful for their age”, can rationally process criticism against China.
Rethinking China and America
Despite her frustration over China’s travel restrictions, Tie says she has become more patriotic since living aboard.
“I had believed America to be a wonderland of dreams, equality and tolerance for all. I certainly don’t believe it
anymore,” she wrote in her school newspaper in June, criticising America’s “Sinophobia”.
In February, she penned an online petition, protesting against her university hosting a panel with Hong Kong
democracy activists.
But Tie says she’s not a “little pink”, a somewhat disparaging term for nationalistic Chinese youth active on the
internet.
“I am patriotic in a rational way, not as a result of brainwashing,” Tie says, adding that she views both Washington
and Beijing critically, citing the lack of freedom of speech in China.
“Both countries let me down many times,” Tie says, “but China is my motherland, so I am more willing to endure that
frustration.”
Similar to Tie, Li plans to return to China after her study, with transformed understandings of her home and host
countries.
In early July, Washington announced a policy barring foreign students from staying in the country, but the decision
was rescinded after receiving waves of criticism.
“It made me feel hopeful about the US,” Li says, “This would not happen in China.”
The sociology and religious studies student thinks the pandemic has laid bare the advantages and weaknesses of both
political systems. While the Chinese government seems to act more effectively, the US allows dissent, and at times, it
is able to correct its own mistakes.
American education has made her “more anti-China,” Li says with a laugh.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvard and MIT sued over the reversed decision to strip international
students of visas if all their courses were online
She recalls feeling “very uncomfortable” when she first arrived in America six years ago and saw her fellow students
waving Taiwanese flags, which are seen in mainland China as a symbol for Taiwan independence.
But after getting to know the Taiwanese students, she realised that though their views may have been completely
different, they could discuss issues respectfully, which is encouraged in American classrooms.
“Studying in the US is an important experience in my life,” one that she says she’d never regret. “But I am eager to
help change China, where my work may be more meaningful.”

A University of Cincinnati dean is investigating an email to an engineering student in which an adjunct instructor
is accused of referring to the novel coronavirus as ""the Chinese virus."" The email came after the student had to
miss a lab session due to being quarantined for possible exposure to the novel coronavirus.
""I think that the school should take disciplinary actions against the professor because (his) actions completely
violate the school's values,"" 20-year-old Evan Sotzing told The Enquirer Thursday evening.
UC investigation underway
University spokeswoman M.B. Reilly said Thursday night that the ""matter has already come to the attention of
the dean who is already looking into this on behalf of the student.""
Sotzing said he has been in contact with UC's Dean of Engineering and Applied Science, John Weidner, who he
says is ""looking into it.""
Weidner said he referred the matter for review to the university's Office of Equal Opportunity and Access. That
department handles inquiries regarding discrimination, harassment or retaliation based on disability, race, color,
religion, national origin and other identities, according to their website.
""These types of xenophobic comments and stigmatizations around location or ethnicity are more than troubling.

something we should all strive for,"" Weidner wrote to The Enquirer.
Emails lay out incident
Sotzing received the email from John Ucker, who is listed as an adjunct instructor in UC's College of Engineering
and Applied Science. He did not reply to an email from The Enquirer Thursday evening.
In emails forwarded to The Enquirer, Sotzing, a third-year engineering student, wrote to Ucker that he would not
be able to attend an in-person lab scheduled for Tuesday because his girlfriend tested positive for the novel
coronavirus at UC's University Health Services.
Sotzing was tested the same day, he said, and he received a negative COVID-19 result. However, Sotzing said
the university's health officials told him to quarantine for two weeks because of his proximity to a positive
patient.
Those tests were taken on Sept. 4, Sotzing said. The lab was scheduled for Tuesday, on Sept. 15, which would
have fallen in the two-week quarantine time period.
Sotzing provided photo evidence of his test results in an email to Ucker, and wrote that he had been told not to
attend any in-person classes until Thursday. Ucker did not reply to Sotzing's email until after the in-person lab
had already happened.
""For students testing positive for the chinese (sic) virus, I will give no grade,"" the email reads. ""You can read the
info I sent to the class re: the torsion test.""
'This kind of language is completely unacceptable'
UC stated in its Return to Campus Guide that it encourages faculty to be flexible with students, especially in
regards to attendance policies during the pandemic. Weidner said Ucker has a ""routine policy"" of allowing
students to forego one of the lab tests so that a grade will not be recorded.
UC has reported 321 COVID-19 cases among students as of Thursday. Hamilton County officials said this week
the positive rate for the new coronavirus is spiking in Cincinnati's Corryville, Mount Auburn and CUF (Clifton
Heights/University Heights/Fairview) neighborhoods around UC.
Sotzing said he is not clear whether Ucker's message meant he was getting a zero grade or if the professor is
merely not grading the assignment.
""This kind of language is completely unacceptable. And especially from people, like, in power... it has no place in
this country and it contributes to Asian xenophobia,"" Sotzing said.
Sotzing posted the professor's email response on Twitter Thursday afternoon.
""My girlfriend tested positive for COVID and the University of Cincinnati's Health Department instructed me to
not attend my in-person lab. Not only did my professor give me a zero for not going, but this was his response,""
the post reads, with a screenshot of the email. Within three hours, the post had over 6,000 likes and over 2,000
retweets.
""He needs to apologize for the fact that he made that comment,"" Sotzing told The Enquirer Thursday.
Harassment rising towardAsian Americans
News of the investigation came on the same day that the U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure
condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.

rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic from President Donald Trump and others. The House measure, a

The University of Cincinnati professor accused of referring to COVID-19 as ""the Chinese virus"" has been put on
administrative leave with pay.
In an email sent to adjunct instructor John Ucker, UC's College of Engineering and Applied Sciences Dean John
Weidner wrote that Ucker's courses will be handled by another faculty member for the time being.
""As you are aware, a student in one of your courses has raised a concern regarding one of your emails. This
matter has been referred to UC's Office of Equal Opportunity and Access (""OEOA"") for review. As such, effective
immediately you are being placed on an administrative leave with pay pending the outcome of that review,"" the
email reads.

PLAINFIELD – A Fanwood man is suing a Plainfield Fire Department official and the city over claims he was the
victim of discrimination because of comments made to him about COVID-19.
Timothy Burkhard, who is Asian American, filed a lawsuit against Plainfield and Deputy Fire Chief Pietro Martino,
after Martino made discriminatory comments about Burkhard's ethnicity and the coronavirus, according to the
lawsuit.
Burkhard, who was hired as a firefighter at the Plainfield Fire Department in July 2018, filed his lawsuit in Union
County Superior Court in July. The case was dismissed but was later reinstated by Union County Superior Court
Judge Mark Ciarrocca on Sept. 11.
In March, Martino began to make ""racist comments about Asians"" to Burkhard during the fire department's
training on COVID-19, according to the lawsuit.
Martino ""mockingly"" asked Burkhard if he had recently been to Wuhan, China ""while he squinted his eyes so that
they narrowed in a racist caricature of Asian facial features and left his mouth open,"" according to the lawsuit.
The ""outrageous conduct"" was witnessed by at least 19 firefighters attending the training, the lawsuit claims.
Five lieutenants and a battalion chief were among those present.

Los Angeles, Sep 18 (IANS) A report released by a US civil rights group showed Asian-Americans have
experienced increased racism since the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country more than 6 months ago.
The report was issued on Thursday by the Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Center, which was formed in March by the
Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, Chinese for Affirmative Action and San Francisco State University's
Asian American Studies department, reports Xinhua news agency.
As of August 5, the report said, 2,583 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination nationwide had been self-reported,
in which over 40 per cent, namely 1,116 reports, occurred in California.
Reports submitted to the group were likely under-counted, the survey noted, citing that 5.4 per cent of Asian-
Americans in California reported being ""unfairly treated"" due to race or ethnicity, compared to 2.1 per cent of all
state residents during pandemic.
The report underlined the impact of racism and xenophobia against Asian-American youth during the pandemic,
while analyzing 341 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination involving youth reported to the Stop AAPI Hate
Reporting Center from March 19 to July 22.
""In over half (56 per cent) of these cases, perpetrators employed anti-Chinese hate speech, including blaming
China and Chinese as the source of the virus and mocking Chinese dietary habits.

Racial discrimination has always been a scar on the American society, one that has been continuously ripped wider open since
the COVID-19 pandemic.
As some U.S. politicians are bent on politicizing the pandemic and maliciously making China a scapegoat for their
incompetence in containing the outbreak, the virus of racial discrimination against Asian Americans is also spreading across
the country.
Asian Americans are frequently humiliated and even attacked in public, and suffering continuous discrimination on social
media platforms.
The racial group faced a double whammy of unemployment and discrimination amid the outbreak, according to many reports
recently released by American research institutions and civil society organizations.
However, some U.S. officials have played dumb about the situation, which has fully revealed the hypocrisy and cruelty of the
so-called American human rights.
Relevant data have been rather dreadful. Racial discrimination against Asian Americans is becoming more common, pointed
out a survey report from American think tank Pew Research Center.
31 percent of Asian Americans said they have been subject to racist slurs or jokes since the pandemic began, while 26
percent said they’ve feared someone might physically attack them, the survey found.
As the number of racist attacks against Asian Americans in various areas of New York has increased significantly, the New
York City Police Department has even established an Asian Hate Crime Task Force recently, the first task force in the U.S. that
is aimed at Asian hate crimes.

Across the country, Asian American health-care workers have reported a rise in bigoted incidents, according to an article
published on The Washington Post.
The racial hostility has left Asian Americans, who represent 6 percent of the U.S. population but 18 percent of the country’s
physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus
pandemic, the article said.
“Some COVID-19 patients refuse to be treated by them. And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing
harassment in their daily lives, too,” it continued.
What lies at the root of such pernicious consequences is certain U.S. politicians’ misdeed of spreading “political virus”.
Some U.S. officials have taken every opportunity and played every trick they can to attack and stigmatize China, including
calling the COVID-19 “Chinese virus” and “Wuhan virus”, which has fostered extremism and racism in the U.S. and become
the main culprit of the dramatically increasing attacks and threats targeting Asian Americans.
The attacks and smear campaign launched against China by some American politicians have ignited anti-Asian sentiment,
according to an article published by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).
“Yet public figures and politicians play a key role in promoting racial equality and non-discrimination principles. In this
regards, it is dismaying to witness State officials adopting alternative named for the COVID-19 coronavirus,” said Tendayi
Achiume, the United Nations (UN) Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and
related intolerance.
“Indeed, instead of using the internationally recognized name of the virus, these (U.S.) officials have adopted names with
geographic references, typically referring to its emergence in China. This sort of calculated use of a geographic-based name
for this virus is rooted in and fosters racism and xenophobia,” she pointed out in a recent statement.
Systemic racism is a malady afflicting the American society.
Color has obviously played a major role in determining the fate of many Americans, U.S. scholar Thomas Sowell wrote in his
book Ethnic America: A History.
In history, the notorious Chinese Exclusion Act and crimes against Asian Americans such as sending a large number of Asians
to concentration camps during the World War II have startled the world.
Asian Americans now still suffer continuous harassment, exclusion and structural discrimination in the U.S., arousing great
concern among the international community and American people with breadth of vision.
This year, the special procedures of the U.N. Human Rights Council have repeatedly condemned the U.S. for its racial
discrimination and hate speech.
Recent hate crimes and violent assaults against people of Asian descent should sound an alarm for America, said nearly 200
American foreign policy scholars and former diplomats in a joint statement issued on USA Today.
They called upon U.S. leaders at every level and in every sector to take action against anti-Asian racism and express support
for Asian diaspora and Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) communities.
Only those who lack competence themselves would deliberately invent divisions and confrontations against others.
The conflicts and antagonisms in the American society won’t stop worsening unless certain U.S. officials break off the political
scheme to pass the buck to China for their misconduct in dealing with the epidemic.
Otherwise, other groups of people, in addition to Asian Americans, may end up a new victim of some U.S. officials.
In the U.S., a country that claims to be a “beacon of freedom”, some U.S. politicians, however, have ignored the international
human rights law, openly incited and condoned racial discrimination, and violated the bottom line of human civilization by
blatantly trampling on human rights, which is by no means tolerable.

SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 17 (Xinhua) -- Asian Americans are experiencing increased racism amid the COVID-19
pandemic, according to two reports released Thursday by Los Angeles-based Stop AAPI (Asian American and
Pacific Islander) Hate Reporting Center.
The first report ""They Blamed Me Because I Am Asian,"" written by 87 high school interns from the center's
Youth Campaign, analyzed 990 interviews with AAPI youths this summer to explore how young people are
coping with rising racism.
It showed that 77 percent of Asian American youths expressed anger over the current anti-Asian hate in the
United States, and 60 percent were disappointed at racism.
Incidents of harassment focused on blaming China and Chinese people as the source of the virus and mocking
Chinese dietary habits, it said.
The second report, written by a group of experts, analyzed 341 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination involving
youths reported to the center from March 19 to July 22, including 24 physical assaults.
It showed that in 56 percent of the incidents, perpetrators employed anti-Chinese hate speech, and that even
though adults were present in almost half of the incidents, bystanders intervened in only 10 percent of the
cases.

Caleb Lee wishes he was surprised to hear that someone spit on an Asian American friend biking in Golden Gate
Park recently. A white woman told his friend, then 16 years old, to go back to China and called her a slur,
according to Lee.
Another friend was also told to go back to China by a classmate, before schools shut down, and called the same
slur.
""I was more angry and pissed off at the fact that the world just doesn't care and disregards this hate toward
us,"" said Lee, a 16-year-old junior at San Francisco's Urban School. ""It's sort of just become a harsh reality that
so many [Asian American Pacific Islander] individuals have been dealing with racism and hate in the form of
physical and verbal harassment.""
Caleb's words echoed some of the despair felt by Asian American youth surveyed this year by Stop AAPI Hate, a
reporting center launched by Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council (A3PCON), Chinese for Affirmative Action,
and San Francisco State University's Asian American Studies Department. The group has tracked more than
2,600 incidents of racial animus since mid-March, when much of the country went into a shel-ter-in-place to
curb coronavirus.
California accounts for 1,135 of those incidents, while 258 occurred in San Francisco as of Thursday. That's
shockingly high compared to 108 in Los Angeles, 54 in San Jose, 50 in Oakland, 28 in San Diego, and 20 in

Sacramento.
Lee and a few other Urban School students worked on a nationwide effort by Stop AAPI Hate to track impact on
youth, culminating in the report ""They Blamed Me Because I Am Asian"" released on Thursday.
Seventy-seven percent of nearly 1,000 youth surveyed expressed anger over the spate of racism, 60 percent
said they were disappointed, and 46 percent expressed sadness or depression. Twenty-three percent said they
were scared.
They received 341 reports from youth nationally over an 18-week period, with 81 percent reporting bullying or
verbal harassment. Twenty-four percent said they faced shunning and social isolation while 8 percent reported
physical assaults.
Nearly 17 percent said they were harassed at school and online, respectively, and 14 percent were harassed in
public parks. Adults were present in 48 percent of the cases but bystanders intervened only 10 percent of the
time. Forty-one percent of incidents were perpetrated by youth, the rest by adults.
Nearly 60 percent of verbal harassment involved blaming Chinese people for the COVID-19 pandemic either as
being infected or as the source, while nearly 26 percent related to dietary habits, like shaming Asian Americans
for supposedly eating bats or dogs. One 17-year-old reported that a white man online told him his insides were
full of bats and to die by suicide for being a ""dirty f________dog-eater.""
""Historically, we've seen [upticks in racism] in pandemics, war and economic downturn,"" said Russell Jeung, a
San Francisco State professor who helped start Stop AAPI hate. ""We have all three. You think San Francisco is
this progressive, liberal town but again, I think, COVID fears and political rhetoric has really screwed up a lot of
anger.""
San Francisco has double the number of physical assaults compared to nationwide, according to Jeung. Density
may explain the concentration, even in places like The City and New York, where overtly welcoming attitudes of
immigrants are expressed.
But ultimately, Jeung said political rhetoric is to blame. President Donald Trump has repeatedly targeted China
for the virus and used epithets like ""Chinese virus"" and ""kung flu"" picked up by right-wing media. He has also
heightened tensions between the two countries, leading to a Cold War-like state of relations that ripples to
individual behavior.
""I just find it very debasing and dehumanizing that others can treat people that way,"" said Jeung, whose wife
was deliberately coughed on by a man in Oakland. ""People are wanting to share their stories and wanting it to
stop from happening. By having that collective voice, we're pushing for more bystander intervention.""
Jeung said that on an individual level, witnesses should attend to the targeted person to make sure they are
safe and to show social support, though he doesn't recommend engagement. Should that not immediately
transpire, people being targeted should call out and ask for assistance or approach someone nearby and express
their concern.
On a larger level, anti-racism training for teachers and administrators while implementing ethnic studies is part
of the answer. Grassroots community workshops and signage in stores help foster an anti-racist culture, too.
Lee said the long-term goal is to change the narrative of Asian Americans as silent, complacent model minorities
who blend into white America. Because the social fallout from the pandemic has proven the ""very false and very
harmful stereotype"" internalized in AAPI minds, too.
In the meantime, they hope workshops and preparing teachers will prevent aggression when the campus is
open again.

• Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have reached an ""alarming level"" amid the COVID-19 pandemic, United Nations officials said.
• In a report made public this week, UN officials expressed ""serious concern over the rising wave of racist and xenophobic attacks,"" which they said President Trump is
""seemingly legitimizing.""
• Asian-American groups have asked public officials such as Trump to refrain from using terms such as ""China virus"" to refer to COVID-19.
• ""Our data and evidence of the real-life stories confirm that Asian-Americans are facing increasing racist and xenophobic attacks, catalyzed by rhetoric from the
president and other government leadership,"" said Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council.
Hate crimes against Asian-Americans have reached an ""alarming level"" across the United States, in part because President Donald Trump appears to validate the
perpetrators' bigotry, according to a report by United Nations officials made public this week.
Citing more than 1,800 racist incidents against Asian Americans from March to May 2020, the report — signed by the UN's special rapporteurs on racism and migrant
rights, as well as the head of the international body's working group on discrimination against women — expresses ""serious concern over the rising wave of racist and
xenophobic attacks,"" particularly in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic.
US authorities, it said, have ""utterly failed to take the steps required to detect, monitor, and prevent racist and xenophobic incidents,"" resulting in a ""state of impunity""
for hateful chauvinists.
In April, Senate Democrats sent a letter to Trump noting guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advising against terms, such as ""Chinese
virus"" and ""Wuhan virus,"" that ""exacerbate prejudice and discrimination in ways that place lives at risk of violence.""
Trump has disregarded that advice, telling Fox News just this past Sunday that he had ""beat this crazy horrible China virus.""
Asian-Americans, in turn, have reported ever more incidents of bigotry. Between March and August 2020, there were more such incidents — over 2,500 — than at the
start of the pandemic, according to researchers at Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition formed to combat racism during the pandemic.
In one reported incident, a Japanese-American woman walking in Los Angeles, California, with her two-year-old son said a white man rolled down his window and
said, ""Tell your kid when he grows up that China did this all."" On the other side of the country, at a grocery store outside Scranton, Pennsylvania, a man yelled, ""This
pandemic wouldn't have happened if you stayed in your country where you belong,"" punctuated with a racial slur.
""We are further concerned by the documented increase in hate and misogynist speech, including incitement to hatred and racial discrimination in public places and
online, and the contribution of the President of the United States in seemingly legitimizing these violations,"" the report said.
Previous research has suggested there is a link between the president's rhetoric and the skyrocketing incidence of hate crimes that has accompanied his presidency.
In 2017, for example, researchers at Tufts University found that, among test subjects, ""exposure to Trump's prejudiced statements made people more likely to write
offensive things.""
""Our data and evidence of the real-life stories confirm that Asian-Americans are facing increasing racist and xenophobic attacks, catalyzed by rhetoric from the
president and other government leadership,"" Manjusha Kulkarni, executive director of the Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, and a leader of Stop AAPI Hate,
said in a statement on Wednesday.
In September, House Democrats passed a resolution calling on public officials to condemn anti-Asian racism and refrain from using terms such as ""Chinese virus"" and
""Kung flu."" But Republicans have resisted such pleas. Rep. Jim Jordan, of Ohio, a close Trump ally, dismissed the resolution as ""just another opportunity to attack the
president,"" while Rep. Andy Biggs, of Arizona, deemed it ""woke culture on steroids.""

202104,"
Reports of hate crimes and bias incidents in Anne Arundel County increased slightly in 2019. However, Montgomery
County surpassed Anne Arundel as the jurisdiction with the highest instance of reports in the state, according to a new
report from the Maryland State Police.
The State of Maryland 2019 Hate Bias Report shows 81 reports of hate crimes or bias incidents in 2019, up from 78 in
2018, continuing the trend of increases beginning in 2014. Many of the incidents were reported in the northern part of
Anne Arundel County, with a heat map showing each zip code by color based on the range of incidents
reported.Between 12 and 19 incidents reported in Pasadena ZIP code 21122; and between six and 11 incidents reported
in each of Glen Burnie ZIP codes 21060 and 21061 and in Millersville ZIP code 21108.
These numbers include both hate crimes - or a crime motivated by prejudice - and hate bias incidents, which do not rise
to the level of criminal charges.
The report distinguishes incidents as verified, meaning an ""investigation leads a reasonable and prudent person to
conclude that the offender's actions were motivated, in whole or in part, by their bias""; inconclusive, meaning the
evidence is conflicting or incomplete, or unfounded, meaning that evidence or an investigation ""definitively indicates
that it was not motivated by bias.""
Of Anne Arundel County's 81 reported hate bias incidents, five were verified, 72 were inconclusive and 4 were
unfounded. Prince George's County accounted for the most verified incidents with 29, 87.9% of the total number of
reports of incidents in the county.

House Minority Leader Del. Nic Kipke said he thinks it's wrong to assume that Pasadena is more racist than any other
part of the county because of its incident counts. Perhaps reporting has increased due to increased attention to racial
discrimination over the past few years.
""We are trying to stop these types of things from happening,"" Kipke said. ""Our entire community condemns racism, and
we are all invested to ensure that those problems end.""
County and state officials were alarmed after last year's report showed Anne Arundel with the highest numbers of
reports.
In response, County Executive Steuart Pittman moved to treat racism as a public health issue; attended training on
policymaking through a racial equity lens; organized an educational hate bias forum in February with the Human
Relations Commission; established an Office of Health Equity and Racial Justice within the health department; and
amended the county slogan to: ""The best place for all.""
The findings of the report underscore that the county's slogan is aspirational, Pittman said.
He said he wouldn't have expected these efforts to curb racism would affect the data immediately but hopes it will make
the county a safer and more equitable place for all people.
He said that last year's report showing Anne Arundel at the top of the list served as a wake-up call, driving county
officials to act. But moving below Montgomery County isn't good news.
""I don't celebrate the fact that Montgomery County had more - that's also bad news,"" Pittman said.
Since state police released this report last year, Pasadena has seen a flurry of activism. Young organizers made it the
site of several demonstrations for racial justice over the summer as communities across the nation grappled with
systemic racism and police brutality, and hyperlocal groups like One Pasadena have popped up to address racism.
Harry Freeman, a member of the group's steering committee, said the group was founded after the publication of last
year's hate bias report.
Now, he said, they are trying to remind the community that, ""These are real stories that affect real people.""
The group doesn't view racism along strictly political party lines but as a cultural and historical problem. Nor does the
group view racism purely as a Black versus white issue, Freeman said, noting that Latinos and Asian Americans also
experience discrimination.
""The thing about racism is that it's not genetic. It's not something you're born with,"" Freeman said. ""You're either
overtly taught to hate, or it's learned.""
Across the state, more than 64% of incidents appear to be motivated by bias related to race, ethnicity or ancestry.
In Anne Arundel County, these race motivated incidents include: an effigy hung on the property of the county's first
Black councilman last October that was said to be a Halloween stunt, a swastika found at South River High School, or a
racist video made by students at Northeast High School.
Elementary and secondary schools are the most common location for people to report hate bias incidents across the
state, followed closely by homes, according to the report.
Pittman said every incident reported to county police is referred to the Anne Arundel Crisis Response, and victims are
offered support or connected with counseling services if needed.
Since last year's report was released, Anne Arundel state legislators strengthened hate crime laws by making it illegal to
threaten or intimidate a group or individual with symbols including nooses or swastikas. The legislation was championed
by Del. Mark Chang, D-Glen Burnie, who is one of the first Korean Americans to be elected to serve in Maryland's
General Assembly.

Thousands of cases logged in pandemic of racial slurs whipped up by Republicans
""A man harassed me on the train, forcing me out of the way and shouting racial slurs: 'I agree with Trump... it's
because of you, the Chinese, we have to wear masks.""
That was one of the more than 2,700 incidents that STOP AAPI Hate, a platform for people to report
coronavirus-related instances of racism, has received from across the United States over the past eight months.
There were at least 46 racially motivated attacks in which US President Donald Trump is invoked, according to
Russell Jeung, chair and professor of Asian American Studies at San Francisco State University, who compiled
the incidents.
""Another said 'Trump's going to f---you, f------Asian piece of----'... so there's a lot of profanity,"" said Jeung, who
couldn't finish reading the example at a recent webinar because of the expletives.
The rhetoric and policies of Trump and his Republican allies have resurrected the centuries-old ""yellow peril""
stereotype, as reflected by millions of racist retweets and thousands of anti-Asian incidents, Jeung said.
Researchers at the University of Michigan, the University of Washington, the University of Maryland and San
Francisco State University recently conducted a study on how often politicians use the stigmatizing rhetoric
about Asian Americans and the reach of that rhetoric by examining tweets issued by Democratic and Republican

These racial slurs are not from 1882; they are commonplace during COVID-19 America.
Unfortunately, discrimination against AAPIs is not new. We saw earlier versions of the ""yellow peril"" propaganda
used to justify the Chinese Exclusion Act as well as the Japanese American incarceration. This year, it is being
used to perpetrate harm on Asian Americans.
These are just two examples of verbal harassment reported to Stop AAPI Hate, the nation's leading aggregator

202104,"
A Louisiana pastor prays as his parishioners die, first from cancer and now from COVID-19. An Indigenous community in New Mexico lacks adequate health care as the death toll mounts. A sick hospital worker in New
Jersey frets about infecting others in her heavily populated neighborhood.
As the country cries out for a vaccine and a return to normal, lost in the policy debates is the reality that COVID-19 kills far more people of color than white Americans. This isn't a matter of coincidence, poor choices or
bad luck – it's by design.
A team of USA TODAY reporters explored how the policies of the past and present have made Black, Asian, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans prime targets for COVID-19. They found:
America's education and economic systems are still unequal, disproportionately leaving people of color out of higher-wage jobs. When COVID-19 struck, more people of color were serving as essential workers directly in
the path of the virus.
Decades of discrimination in housing corralled people of color into tightly packed neighborhoods, fueling the virus' spread. Those neighborhoods tend to lie in ""food deserts,"" leading to diabetes, obesity and heart
disease that make people more likely to die from the virus.
Environmental policies designed by white power brokers at the expense of the poor have poisoned the air they breathe, fueling cancers and leaving communities weakened in the path of the virus. A lack of federal
funding left the most vulnerable communities cut off from health care at the most critical moment.
Put simply, America's history of racism was itself a preexisting condition.
Of the 10 U.S. counties with the highest death rates from COVID-19, seven have populations where people of color make up the majority, according to data compiled by USA TODAY. Of the top 50 counties with the
highest death rates, 31 are populated mostly by people of color.
""COVID-19 has brought out into the open, with painful clarity, these divisions in our society that have been there for a long time but, for one reason or another, people were able to overlook them,"" said Philip
Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College.
With nearly 1,000 people a day dying from the virus and scientists scrambling to grasp exactly how the virus spreads and kills, federal and state data has not provided enough demographic detail to show the full impact
on communities of color. The race and ethnicity of people who contract the virus is known in 52% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
But study after study has shown clear patterns in whom the virus kills.
Black people are more than twice as likely to die from the virus than white people, and Hispanics and Native Americans are 1.5 times more likely to die, according to The COVID Tracking Project.
""You can't change the fact that America is so segregated and that people of color tend to live in communities where the environmental conditions are worse, and that can increase your risk of heart disease or lung
disease and diabetes,"" said Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation's largest philanthropy dedicated solely to health care. ""You can't
change that in the short run.""
A team of USA TODAY reporters pored over lawsuits challenging housing and health care policies, analyzed demographic data for communities hit hardest by COVID-19 and studied documents that reveal how
government and business leaders worked together to marginalize populations. They interviewed the descendants of enslaved Americans who were denied homeownership in white neighborhoods and Indigenous
Americans who had been funneled into reservations in exchange for federally funded health care that never came. They walked through Black communities on the fence line of polluting chemical plants, spent time with
Latino farm workers unable to afford the very food they harvested, and entered the homes of Asian immigrants afraid of being attacked by neighbors if they tested positive for the coronavirus.
Housing policies speed spread of virus
In Essex County, New Jersey, decades of housing policies, laws and unspoken pacts excluded communities of color from spacious suburbs and forced them to cram into poor, often neglected neighborhoods in the urban
core of Newark. Now, Essex has the 12th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country, according to data compiled by USA TODAY, fueled in large part by the high numbers of Black Americans living in segregated,
low-income neighborhoods.
That includes Ahou Yao, 40, a respiratory therapist at a local hospital who contracted COVID-19 in April and was forced to self-isolate in her bedroom in the two-bedroom apartment she shares with her husband and
two young boys. She struggled from fever, shortness of breath and body aches and was unable to work for a month. Her husband had to go out for food, run errands and navigate their crowded neighborhood.
""Now I'm scared,"" she said, ""scared that he has it, too.""
Her husband has since developed a cough and chest pains, prompting a trip to the emergency room. He started self-isolating, passing the responsibility of venturing outside back to his wife.
Environmental policies make people vulnerable
In Louisiana, along a stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, former slave plantations house massive chemical plants that spew chemicals deemed dangerous by the Environmental
Protection Agency. When the plants were constructed, white homeowners had the means to move away, in time leaving a mostly Black population to breathe toxic air and suffer from such high rates of cancer that the
entire region was dubbed ""Cancer Alley.""
One of those plants, in St. John the Baptist Parish, is the only one in the nation that produces neoprene. The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions from the production process
are so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to the plant as having the highest risk of cancer in the entire country. In September, St. John the Baptist Parish had the 27th highest
death rate from COVID-19 in the nation, according to a USA TODAY analysis.
The Rev. Lionel Murphy of the Tchoupitoulas Chapel, which sits 2 miles from the chloroprene plant, has counseled many Black families over the years as they've come down with diabetes, respiratory illnesses and rare
cancers. Now, he's seeing his neighbors die from COVID-19.
""People get sick, people die, you go bury them,"" Murphy said. ""But there's no fight to erase the problem.""
Health care missing when needed
In McKinley County, New Mexico, many local residents struggle to find health care.

Year after year, Congress has failed to allocate enough money to fulfill its legal obligation to provide health care to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni people who make up the majority of McKinley
County's population.
A 2018 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights titled ""Broken Promises"" found the federal government spends nearly four times as much on health per person through government programs than it spends for
each Indigenous person.
That helps explain why McKinley County has the nation's sixth-highest death rate from COVID-19, according to USA TODAY data, with more than 240 people dying in the isolated corner of the state.
Anna Marie Rondon, executive director of the New Mexico Social Justice and Equity Institute in McKinley County (who is Diné, as the Navajo people call themselves), said the ravages of COVID-19 are not an isolated
tragedy but the latest chapter in Indigenous people's long history of abuse and neglect from the U.S. government.
On the Navajo Nation, inadequate resources have resulted in widespread water poverty, food insecurity and high rates of illness. These daily realities were devastating long before the pandemic, but they've also helped
fuel a high COVID-19 death rate.
""It's really an unbelievable chain of oppression – it's still squeezing us, it still has its grip,"" Rondon said. ""And it's still killing us.""
Food deserts make people vulnerable
In California, Imperial Valley is considered the nation's winter breadbasket, producing 80% of the country's fresh vegetables during the cold months. But the predominantly Hispanic workers who pick alfalfa, lettuce,
sugar beets and carrots can rarely afford to buy them.
Nearly 75% of adults and 13% of children are obese or overweight for their age, according to state data. On the other end of the spectrum, 31% of kids in Imperial County don't get enough to eat each day, according
to a 2018 report by Feeding America, a national anti-hunger organization based in Washington, D.C.
""If they're already on food stamps, to spend the extra money to get fruits and vegetables, it's expensive,"" said Jessica Solorio, executive director of Spread the Love, a local food bank.
Those figures show why COVID-19 has been so fatal in the county, with 16 deaths per 10,000, nearly three times the national average, according to the USA TODAY analysis.
Cultural barriers complicate response
In San Francisco, community activists are worried that the number of Asian Americans getting COVID-19 is being vastly underreported.
Of the county's nearly 12,000 positive test results, only 12% are Asian American, yet Asian Americans have made up 38% of the death count. Experts attribute that alarming disconnect to a number of factors, including
the fear of losing a job after a positive test, language barriers, lack of health care, growing anti-Asian hate crimes, and what's called the ""model-minority myth"" – an assumption that education and financial successes
enjoyed by some Asian Americans apply to all 20-some Asian ethnicities.
Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a nonprofit that helps residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, said her community suffers from an average household income a quarter
of the city's average, low high school graduation rates and obstacles to health care. Add a COVID-19 testing regime tailored to those proficient in English and an often fatalistic attitude toward the pandemic in the
community, and Young said the virus has been painful to the Asian American community.
""I've asked our clients why they're not getting tested,"" she said. ""Often the reaction I get is, 'I'm going to die anyway, and if I test positive, then I can't go to work.""
'We become invisible'
Ask Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, why so many people of color across the U.S. are dying from COVID-19 and she goes back 400 years to the arrival of the first
enslaved Africans to colonial U.S. shores.
Racism is so entrenched in the American way of life, she said, that it's impossible to separate the high death rates of marginalized communities from the nation's historic treatment of each of them. From the broken
promises of reparations to the terrible treatment of immigrants, from redlining practices that excluded Black Americans from homeownership to the GI Bill money that went mostly to white service members returning
from World War II, Wright says COVID-19 is once again revealing the precarious position people of color often find themselves in.
But with no national response from the federal government and only limited actions taken by states or localities, Wright said her people are still stuck in the same situation: invisible.
""We have built-in systems that work against Black people moving up the economic ladder,"" Wright said. ""That pattern continues. Racism is so entrenched that we become invisible.""

At this crucial time of confronting systemic anti-Black and anti-Indigenous racism, the Canadian government
must take responsibility for its enduring role in propagating racism. This includes through its misleading self-
portrayal in Discover Canada, the official study guide for the test taken by Canadian citizenship applicants.
Issued in 2011, the guide aims to teach prospective citizens about Canada's history, geography, culture, and
political and justice systems. Disgracefully, the document whitewashes colonialism, conceals genocide,
minimizes systemic racism and its inhumane consequences, and portrays these as remnants of the past even as
the guide itself engages in racist discourse.
We write as female faculty members at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto. Our
perspective on these issues is borne of our shared concerns yet differing relationships to ""Canadian"" nationality.

surviving transatlantic enslavement, two are new-ish Canadians (white European heritage, from the United
States and South Africa), another is a permanent resident from the U.S. (from Venezuela).
Recognizing Discover Canada's flaws, the government set out in 2016 to remove certain offensive elements,
including the portrayal of immigrants'""barbaric cultural practices"" and the glorification of military exploits.
A draft shared with The Canadian Press in 2017 incorporated coverage of the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission's 2015 report, as well as discussion of discrimination against people of racialized backgrounds,
people with disabilities, LGBTQ2S+ people and other marginalized communities.
Despite an expected 2017 release - during Canada's sesquicentennial - the new version, inexplicably, never
came to light. Outrageously, Discover Canada is still the welcome guide for new Canadians. Just a few of its
shameful elements include: 1. It presents a sanitized account of Indigenous peoples, before and under
colonization. This erases the history and legacy of stolen lands and dispossession, the upheaval of nations,
cultural genocide, broken treaties, assimilation policies such as residential schools, police and carceral racism,
continued heinous living conditions on reserves and hugely inequitable health outcomes.
From the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which states Indigenous people are sovereign, to the British North
America Act of 1867, there is no discussion of how the Doctrine of Discovery shaped the nation. Discover
Canada also omits Indigenous people's resistance movements, past and present, that contest historical and
ongoing forms of colonialism and oppression. 2. The guide celebrates Upper Canada as ""the first province in the
Empire to move toward abolition"" and as a ""safe haven"" for enslaved Black people escaping the United States.
But there is no mention of Canada's own history of slavery, nor of the pervasive racist violence and human
rights violations faced by African and Black Canadians. The guide's omission of the Code Noir (1685, revised in
1789) further erases the reality of policed and enslaved African lives, which included forced religious conversion,
sanctioned punishment and other brutalities.
This legacy, combined with successor policies, has generated overrepresentation of Black and Indigenous
children in foster care and Children's Aid facilities and high rates of educational, food and housing insecurity, all
generating worse health outcomes among Black Canadians.
Likewise, anti-Asian racism is covered only superficially. The horrendous Komagata Maru event is overlooked.
The internment of Japanese-Canadians during the Second World War is discussed fleetingly, with no mention of
numbers affected (over 22,000), uncompensated liquidation of property, family separation or forced postwar
relocation.
The guide flags government apologies, but not the racist ideologies and practices justifying such policies. This is
the case with anti-Chinese discrimination, including the ""Head Tax, a race-based entry fee,"" and more recently
witnessed in hateful attacks on Asian Canadians during both the SARS and COVID-19 pandemics. 3. Amid
overwhelming, long-standing evidence of systemic police brutality targeting racialized communities, the guide's
use of the phrase, ""Remember, the police are there to help you"" contradicts the everyday reality of policing for
Black, brown and Indigenous peoples. This includes: repeated instances of violence, racial profiling and
harassment against Black and Indigenous communities, the RCMP's complicity in missing and murdered
Indigenous women and girls, and grossly disproportional incarceration of Black and Indigenous populations. 4.
In discussing the 1982 Charter of Rights and Freedoms, the guide is highly selective regarding which rights are
acknowledged and emphasized. While the guide repeatedly stresses the importance of religious freedom, it fails
to mention equality and non-discrimination as fundamental rights. This selective presentation of key human
rights protections gives prospective citizens a distorted picture.
The guide also misses the opportunity to endorse key human rights protections against racism, which are
central to mitigating the effects of systemic discrimination on people's well-being, financial security, education
and work aspirations.

The New York Police Department is forming an Asian Hate Crime Task Force, its first-ever task force dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.
The city has seen a rise in hate crimes directed at Asian people since the coronavirus pandemic began, the NYPD said. Staffed by 25 detectives of Asian descent who
speak a combined nine Asian languages, the group is tasked with guiding victims through the justice system, from reporting a crime all the way to prosecution. It
will remain after the pandemic, the NYPD said.
""When a victim looks at an Asian cop, they'll see, 'Oh he reminds me of my brother, or my son,'"" said Stewart Loo, the NYPD deputy inspector who heads the task
force. ""It gives them some comfort level.""
The nation's largest police department logged 23 incidents of coronavirus hate crimes, a separate category created this year to track crimes targeting someone for
their identity based on the perception that it has something to do with Covid-19. All but one targeted New Yorkers of Asian descent.
Hate crimes overall have plunged in the city, according to NYPD data. There were 206 hate crimes recorded by the NYPD between Jan. 1 and Sept. 27, down 33%
compared with 308 in the same period a year ago. Incidents of anti-Semitism, which account for the majority of hate crimes reported in the city, fell 50%.
Deputy Inspector Mark Molinari, commanding officer of NYPD's Hate Crime Task Force, said he wasn't surprised when crimes rose against Asian people. The origins
of the virus in China, he said, would inspire some people to irrationally blame Asian-Americans.
But what he hadn't foreseen was the reluctance of some victims to cooperate with authorities—some driven by fear of law enforcement, others by a lack of English
proficiency, and still more who worried about their troubles going public, he said.
""They would not answer our phone call, they would not answer the door for us,"" Mr. Molinari said.
When he discussed these problems during a virtual town hall with the public, Mr. Loo, a commanding officer at the Manhattan South Detective Bureau, reached out
with a proposal: create a team of Asian-American officers to investigate crimes that involve Asian victims or witnesses.
So far, officers on the task force have been sent out to chat with Asian victims in person, and have successfully convinced some to report crimes, Mr. Loo said. The
officers are loaned to the task force as needed, but also have full-time jobs elsewhere in the department.
Mr. Loo, who immigrated to the U.S. from Taiwan as a child in 1983, said his father was robbed multiple times working as a delivery man for Chinese restaurants in
Manhattan during the 1980s. He would serve as a translator between his dad and the police, he said.
""I was kind of like 8 or 9 years old, trying to translate, trying to get through,"" he said. ""It was tough.""
Those experiences partly inspired him to join the NYPD in 2000, he said.
""With Covid and the whole anti-Asian sentiment, it's a very uncomfortable feeling being out in public,"" he said.
Coronavirus-related hate crimes have occurred in neighborhoods in all five boroughs of the city except Staten Island, NYPD data showed. Manhattan has
experienced the most, with 13 incidents, followed by five in Brooklyn, three in Queens and two in the Bronx. Arrests have been made in 15 cases.
In one March incident, the police said, a group of four teenage girls approached a 51-year-old woman on an MTA bus in the Bronx. The teens attacked the woman,
made anti-Asian statements and struck her in her head with an umbrella before fleeing the bus. The woman was taken to a local hospital where she received

This year has witnessed an alarming spike in hate incidents against Asians around the world. The surge of
openly racist and xenophobic attacks has only exacerbated the dark reality of a cruel pandemic overshadowing
the globe.
But this tragic situation has also sparked hopeful activism, forging some new heroes in the battle against racism
and discrimination - including Xiaojiu Zhu PhD, MBE, a distinguished lawyer at the Cruickshanks firm in London,
the United Kingdom.
In the face of rising reports of discrimination against the Chinese community in the UK, including stories of
children being targeted at school, Zhu believed something needed to be done. And as a lawyer, she considered it
her duty to help people in the Chinese community protect their interests and legal rights.
Zhu came up with the idea of having an online forum for Chinese communities on responding to racism during
the pandemic. The May 27 event, organized by the UK Beijing Association, the UK Society of Chinese Lawyers,
and the Roundtable of Southern California Chinese-American Organizations, featured keynote speakers -
including Zhu - who encouraged people to take positive actions against racism and discrimination, such as
reporting incidents to authorities and taking legal recourse.
More than 8,000 people from over 10 countries attended the forum, and the online replay attracted some
10,000 views. This extraordinary reception was a testament to the significance of racism to Chinese around the

Organisers of BLM say findings show movement has exposed pre-existing fault lines
A majority of people believe Black Lives Matter, the anti-racism movement that spread across the UK this
summer, has increased racial tension, according to a poll.
Just over half (55%) of UK adults believe the BLM protests that took place in big cities but also in the Shetland
Islands and the Isle of Wight, increased racial tensions, according to a survey of more than 2,000 people by
pollsters Opinium. Only 17% of the people polled in October disagreed. The polling also showed 44% of ethnic
minorities felt BLM increased racial tensions.
The findings, which BLM organisers said showed the movement has exposed existing fault lines, comes
alongside parallel research indicating sharp rises in the number of black people saying they faced discrimination
in the last year rising from 74% in 2019 to 81%. In a possible sign of racism arising from the origin of Covid-19
in Wuhan, the proportion of Chinese people saying they faced discrimination over the same period rose from
68% to 76%, according to polling carried out in June.
Opinium’s annual survey of multicultural Britain also found that 71% of Asian people had suffered discrimination
or abuse because of their ethnicity rising to 81% among black people.

A Japanese jazz pianist was trying to get to his New York City home one September night when he was brutally
attacked by eight teens.
He suffered fractures in his right arm and shoulder, a broken collarbone, and bruises all over his body and head.
He has not been able to play the piano since the attack. He told The New York Times he remembers at least one
of the teens calling him Chinese and using a profanity.
In late 2019, the first case of novel coronavirus was discovered in Wuhan, China. Since then, the world has seen
more than 52 million cases and more than 1.2 million deaths.
COVID-19 has put all Americans in harm’s way, but it has made life particularly unsafe for the Asian American
community. We need to do something about this.
Hate crimes and microaggressions against those in the Asian American community have increased since the
beginning of the pandemic. More than 2,000 race-related hate incidents against Asian Americans were reported
between March and June. That’s reported incidents. No one knows for sure how many incidents have gone
unreported.
Asian Americans live in a constant loop of microaggressions and hate because of ignorance and racism.
Incumbent President Donald J. Trump’s rhetoric has further incited anti-Asian sentiments.

For nearly three months at home in Shenyang, high school senior Alan Liu woke up at dinner time every day,
had a quick meal with his family and then logged on to the computer for online classes.
He would then go to bed shortly after breakfast.
Like hundreds of Chinese students, Alan returned home from the US earlier this year to escape the Covid-19
pandemic but the complete difference in schedule, he said, has created minor tensions within the family.
Yet, he is one of the lucky ones - others stuck in the United States have found themselves evicted from hostels,
isolated from their families and, in some cases, caught in the crosshairs of rising US-China tensions.
In September, the US cancelled more than 1,000 Chinese student visas under a presidential measure denying
entry to students and researchers deemed to be security risks
There are nearly 370,000 Chinese students studying in the US, or about one-third of the international student
population in the country.
Many of them pay a significant sum to study at top American institutions but a growing number, like 18-year-old
Steven Yu, are in high school in the US to prepare them for tertiary education.

The Henan native, who is attending a school in Cambridge, Massachusetts, was unable to return home earlier
this year after flights were repeatedly cancelled as the pandemic swept the globe. After rescheduling his flight
five times, Steven decided it was just not worth the trouble.
""Of course, there were scalpers selling tickets but these were going for nearly 100,000 yuan (S$20,600), it's
ridiculous especially when you know someone else is profiteering from this,"" he told The Straits Times.
But remaining in the US has led to other challenges; the high school senior has been unable to take the SATs,
usually a requirement for university applications in the country.
""In theory we could drive four hours to the nearest town where there's an open test centre, but I don't have a
driver's licence or a car, and the bus does not start till dawn.

""Staying overnight is not an option because we are below the minimum age of 21 for unaccompanied hotel
stays. So if the test starts at 8am, what options do I have?"" he said.
Many of those who choose to remain in the US are from more modest family backgrounds, the teenager added,
and they have been trying not to ask their parents for more money so as to not worry them.
While most US colleges have made SATs optional for applicants this year, Steven said there is still difficulty in
applying for schools.
For others who have made it to university, freshman year during a pandemic has also proven challenging:
orientation parties and gatherings, usually key in welcoming students to schools, have been curbed.
During his three months in college, engineering student Caleb Jian found himself in quarantine twice after
Covid-19 cases occurred in his student dormitory in a university on the east coast.
""In the beginning, the school was testing us once a week to make sure that we were clear of the virus but now
they have stopped because there are too many cases,"" he said.

After reviewing my interview notes for the whole year, I find one word that sticks out - racism. I have listened to
the stories of many members from the Chinese community since COVID-19 began spreading in the United
States early this year and Asian Americans first reported facing racial bias.
Closing the notebook, I saw three faces in my mind's eye - they are filled with confusion, frustration and fear.
Never more fearful
Julie Tang had been a judge at the San Francisco Superior Court for 26 years. The person who understands
more of self-protection than average people said she was ""happy sheltering in my little condominium ""because
she did not want to risk being spit upon or told to go back to China.
Though racial prejudice is not new to the Chinese immigrant who has lived in the US for 50 years, Tang said she
has never felt more fearful for her personal safety than now.
""I just don't want to confront it now because this is a very scary time. It is like going back to a war where you
can be shot at,"" she said. ""When racism rears its ugly head, we don't know if we can protect ourselves or our
family.""
Some of my friends told me they sympathize with the fear of the retired judge even though they have not
experienced any incident yet.

Some initial evidence suggested the virus began in bats, which infected another animal that may have spread it
to people at one of Wuhan, China’s “wet markets.” Such markets sell fresh meat, fish and vegetables, and some
also sell live animals, such as chickens, that are butchered on site to ensure freshness for consumers, The
Associated Press reported.
The information quickly got distorted in the US, spurring racist memes on social media that portrayed Chinese
people as bat eaters responsible for spreading the virus, and reviving century-old tropes about Asian food being
dirty. Fueling the fire, President Donald Trump repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as “the China virus.”
“That old-school rhetoric that we eat bats, dogs and rats — that racism is still alive and well,"" said Clarence
Kwan, creator of the anti-racist cooking zine “Chinese Protest Recipes.” The speed with which such false
stereotypes resurfaced during the pandemic is ""a reflection of how little progress we’ve made,” Kwan said.
In the Wuhan market where the virus is believed to possibly have originated, vendors also advertised wildlife for
sale. Of the 33 samples from the market that tested positive for the coronavirus, officials say 31 were from the
area where wildlife booths were concentrated. But wildlife and other “exotic” animals are not part of the modern
mainstream Asian diet, either in Asian countries or in the US

Stop AAPI Hate, a coalition of Asian-American advocacy groups, issued a report in August stating that it had
received more than 2,500 reports of hate and discrimination across the country since the group was founded in
March, around the time the outbreak began to seriously worsen in the US The group said it received data from
47 states, with 46% of the incidents taking place in California, followed by 14 percent in New York.
In addition, Asian-American small businesses have been among the hardest hit by the economic downturn
during the pandemic. While there was a 22 percent decline in all small business-owner activity nationwide from
February to April, Asian-American business-owner activity dropped by 26 percent, according to a study by the
National Bureau of Economic Research.
Many businesses that survived have been subject to stigmatization, Kwan said. “Restaurants have been
vandalized. As if the pandemic wasn’t hard enough, there’s this added threat to Asian businesses of this
lingering hate.”
Conversations about the stigmatization of Asian food reached a crescendo this month when Philli Armitage-
Mattin, a contestant on “MasterChef: The Professionals,” used the phrase “Dirty Food Refined” and the hashtag
#prettydirtyfood in her Instagram bio, which described her as an Asian food specialist.
“In a year where Chinese and East Asian communities have essentially been blamed for the pandemic and
chastised as ‘dirty,’ this type of narrative is completely unacceptable,” Kwan wrote on Instagram.
Armitage-Mattin's bio has since been changed and the London-based chef apologized on Instagram, while also
insisting that she had never meant to insult anyone.
“The way I mean food to be ‘dirty’ is indulgent street food; food that comforts you as in, ‘going out for a dirty
burger,’” she wrote.
But Kwan said especially in the current climate, such phrases can be dangerous.
“It was a very flippant, ignorant, tone-deaf way of talking about Asian food,” he said.
Racist rhetoric referring to Asian food as dirty or disease-laden dates back to the 1850s, said Ellen Wu, a history
professor at Indiana University. Wu said the false notion that Chinese people eat rat or dog meat is rooted in the
xenophobic fears of white workers who used Chinese immigrant workers as a scapegoat for their economic
woes.
“To white Americans, these new immigrants were different in a threatening way, and there is fear of the ‘other,’
of difference,” said Wu, who is Asian-American.
English professor Anita Mannur of Miami University said the current crisis reminds her of racist cartoons from
the late 1800s that advertised for rat poison by picturing a Chinese man about to eat one of the rodents.
Mannur, who is Indian-American, said other persistent false narratives such as that Chinese American
neighborhoods or Chinatowns are dens of vice send the message that Asian people are less civilized, and do
""very immediate damage.”
“People have had their houses graffitied with things like ‘Dog eaters live here,’"" she said. “People are beaten up
and spat on. People are told to go back to China.”
Benny Yun, owner of the Yang Chow restaurant in Los Angeles’ Chinatown district and two other locations in
Southern California, said even though his businesses have survived the pandemic, they get prank calls almost
daily asking if they have dog or cat on the menu or impersonating a thick Asian accent.

The oldest Chinatown in the United States is starting to resemble a ghost town. Red lanterns swinging above the pagodas are
reminiscent of tumbleweed. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, tourism has declined drastically, leaving beloved businesses
questioning their future.
San Francisco's Chinatown, a historic neighborhood that has been a beacon for immigrants and the ""American dream,"" has faced racial
discrimination, repressive legislation, a massive earthquake, and now a pandemic - one of the greatest tests of this resilient
neighborhood's more than century-long existence.
It is in this situation where Orlando Kuan finds himself, on a metal folding chair next to a crowded table of pastries outside his
storefront on a Sunday afternoon, frequently known to be the busiest day for business. Grant Avenue, a once-bustling street in San
Francisco's Chinatown, is devoid of tourists. Only the most loyal locals are left to patronize their favorite family-owned businesses.
Eastern Bakery, a cornerstone of the neighborhood, first opened its doors in 1924, and it became the oldest bakery in Chinatown. But
business has slowed to a crawl. During the Mid-Autumn Festival, typically one of the busiest times of year, the bakery logged a 70%
drop in sales, according to Kuan.
Still, he continues to personally greet customers - who once included President Bill Clinton - marveling at his table of famous lotus
mooncakes and coffee crunch cake, a traditional recipe that is a big seller.
In March, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a stay-home order, which restricted nonessential travel, affecting 40 million
Californians. In July, he called for statewide closures for dine-in restaurants, bars, movie theaters, and family entertainment centers
such as bowling alleys, mini-golf facilities, and arcades.
Now, Portsmouth Square, Chinatown's living room, is devoid of the usual pack of Chinatown residents who come to the park to mingle,
practice Tai Chi, and play checkers.
According to the San Francisco Travel Association, tourism to the city has been slashed in half, and tourist spending has plunged by
nearly 70% this year.

close for a month due to COVID-19 exposure. I took time off from work to take care of my 4-year-old. When I
returned to work, my coworkers began treating me differently. They know about what happened at my child's
day care. When I walk in a room, I see them whispering to each other and/or they leave the room altogether, as
if to avoid me. One coworker specifically asked me if I had the ""kung-flu."" I am Asian American and I was
offended by this comment. Another coworker said that it wasn't fair that I got to take a ""month-long vacation,"" I
verbally complained to my manager about the racist remark and being treated differently by my coworkers and
she assured me that she would take care of it.
A couple of weeks later, my manager told me that I was being transferred to the graveyard shift. My manager
knows that I cannot work that shift because I have a young child I told her that this was not fair and that I
thought I was being retaliated against for taking time off because of a COVID-19 closure of my child's day care

In theory, Valley Brook Tea is an unlikely place for a hate crime. The speciality tea store is located on a busy
commercial avenue in Washington's affluent Dupont Circle area, just steps away from some of the most popular
bars and cafes, high-end hotels and multimillion-dollar town houses in the nation's capital, a city which prides
itself on tolerance and diversity.
Yet, on a quiet morning last month, this was where a rising wave of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment came
for 29-year-old Yunhan Zhang, who opened his store in February.
The store's closed circuit television captured what happened: a man, wearing red pants and a black jacket,
enters the store yelling ""Covid-19!"" After being told to go away, the agitated assailant pulls out a can of pepper
spray, using it on Zhang as he continues to hurl insults - which explicitly contained the term ""Chinese"" - before

For Zhang, an 11-year resident of the United States, the motive was clear. It marked the second time, he said,

Asian-Americans have noted a steady rise in incidents throughout the four years of the Trump administration.

pandemic. The Stop AAPI Hate Reporting Centre, a California-based group that monitors attacks on Asian-
Americans and Pacific Islanders, for example, reported more than 2,700 incidents between March and late
October alone - a figure the organisation believes is just the ""tip of the iceberg"".
To combat this wave of xenophobia and anti-Asian sentiment, policy experts and community activists believe
that Joe Biden's incoming administration can take a number of steps, starting with a rapid reversal of Trump's
immigration policies.
John Yang, the president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice, a Washington-based civil
rights group, said that ending many of these policies would help ""change the narrative"" on Asian-Americans.
""Immediately, we'd expect the [incoming] president to take a number of measures by executive order, or
rescind executive orders that have hurt immigrants,"" he said. ""This has a direct impact on the population, but
also sends a message that immigrants are welcome in the United States.""
One step that Biden could take through executive order, Yang said, was dropping the ""public charge"" rule that
allowed immigration officials to deny ""green cards"" - permanent residency - to immigrants who might need
public assistance, like food stamps. Opponents of the measure, first announced in 2018, have termed it a
""wealth test"" for immigrants.
""For the last four years, the narrative has been that immigrants are not welcome here, and that communities of
colour are somehow a threat,"" Yang added. ""That has to change, and that can change through executive 
orders.""
Other steps could include facilitating H1-B visas, which allow US employers to temporarily employ foreign
nationals in specialised occupations. In October, the Trump administration said it would impose salary
requirements - of US$150,000 to US$250,000 a year, depending on location and job title - on companies
employing these skilled overseas workers. At the time, the government said that the primary purpose of the
change was to ""reflect the actual wages earned by US workers similarly employed to foreign workers"".
Government statistics show that most of the almost 600,000 H1-B visa holders in the US are from China and
India. Earlier in the year, Trump signed an executive order suspending an array of worker visas - including H1-
Bs - before that decision was overturned by a federal judge. The announcement regarding the salary
requirements came the following week. Last week, a federal judge in California struck down the revised Trump
administration rules.
Doing away with H1-B visa restrictions ""would send a strong signal that immigrants are welcome and that
vilifying various groups isn't appropriate"", said Russell Jeung, the Stop AAPI Hate chair and an Asian American
Studies professor at San Francisco State University.
""We recommend reversing immigration bans and stopping the suspension of visas for Chinese researchers and
students, as well as rescinding the ban on racial sensitivity training"" at federal agencies, he added. ""In the first
100 days, a lot can be done to signal that we're ending racist policies.""
Many of these steps were outlined by the Biden campaign in an agenda for Asian-Americans and Pacific
Islanders released ahead of the November election. Biden vowed to provide a ""road map"" to citizenship for
undocumented immigrants, including 1.7 million from Asia. He also promised to support family-based
immigration and increase the number of visas offered for permanent, work-based immigration.
The Biden transition team did not respond to a request for comment on its plans for the Asian-American

community.
Policy experts believe that a change in tone from the president and other administration officials on relations
with China would have an important impact on how Asian-Americans are perceived in the US.
Jeung said that Stop AAPI Hate believes a ""more sane, diplomatic foreign policy"" - rather than a ""heated cold
war"" - will help ease feelings of animosity towards Chinese and Asian-Americans in communities across the
country.
""We've seen how US-China relations have impacted domestic race relations,"" he said. ""You can be critical, but
… a critique of China's policies doesn't mean we should vilify Chinese people.""
This rhetoric, Jeung added, became more pronounced during the pandemic, which Trump repeatedly termed
the ""Chinese Virus"" and ""Kung Flu"". Hundreds of incidents of harassment have been recorded in which similar
terms were used.
""The tone in which Trump mocked Chinese people and joked about the pandemic really gave people license to
also attack the people, rather than criticise a government's policies,"" Jeung said. ""We're portrayed as
outsiders and we need to have a greater sense that everyone can belong to the United States. It has a
tangible impact.""
Many Chinese-American community organisers believe that having Asian-American figures in Biden's cabinet
or in other high-level administration positions would serve as an important symbol. ""It would be great to see
Chinese and Asian-American appointees,"" said Leanna Louie, a founder of the United Peace Collaborative, a
registered non-profit organisation in San Francisco that has patrolled the city's Chinatown during the
pandemic.
""If other Asians see that someone, like [businessman and former presidential candidate] Andrew Yang was in
the cabinet, they'd think to get involved and help the community,"" she added.
""People need to think of the community as a whole rather than just themselves.""
Trump does have one Asian-American in his cabinet: Taiwan-born Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao, a
long-time Republican figure who previously served as Secretary of Labor in the Bush administration. Last
week, Trump also nominated Chao, the wife of Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell, to the board of
trustees of the John F. Kennedy Centre for the Performing Arts.
""Having an immigrant background doesn't mean you represent the interest of immigrants, or support those of
different class or racial backgrounds,"" Jeung said of Chao. ""She hasn't had much impact … she either doesn't
have a voice on those issues in the administration or hasn't been a strong enough advocate.""
Looking ahead to the Biden administration, Jeung said that he believes that the presence of vice-president-
elect Kamala Harris - whose mother was from India - will have a beneficial impact on Americans whose
families originated in other parts of Asia.
""She's the daughter of immigrants and talks about her mother. That makes a difference to the community.
It's not about having diversity for diversity's sake, it's about having a diverse cabinet that understands all the
different issues that we have to grapple with in the country,"" he said. ""Having a cabinet that reflects the
complexity of America will only make the government stronger.""
Last Thursday, the Biden transition team announced that Katherine Tai, now the chief trade lawyer for the
House Ways and Means Committee, would be nominated to the cabinet-level position of US trade
representative. If confirmed by the Senate, Tai, a Taiwanese-American, will be the first Asian-American to
hold the position. ""I cannot stress the importance of naming Katie Tai as US trade representative,"" Jeung

"
202104,"
On Feb. 29, hundreds of people packed into the Pullman Christian Reformed Church, a squat, beige brick building on
Chicago's South Side. An attendee began the ceremonies by blasting a shofar, the trumpet made out of a ram's horn.
Somebody played keyboard. And a long line of people waited to speak into a microphone about their memories of Angeli
Demus. |The lifelong Chicagoan, who had died a month earlier at age 59, insisted she didn't want it called a funeral.
""Donate, cremate, celebrate,"" had been her credo to her family near the end of a gutting battle with lung cancer, and with
her eyes donated and her body cremated, all that was left was this party. |Her husband, Earl Demus, billed it as ""Angeli's
Joyous Celebration,"" and thought that the crowd it gathered spoke to his wife's beloved nature. ""Standing room only,""
recounted Demus, who estimated there were more than 450 people there. ""I stopped counting after a while.""
The disconcerting news story that seemed recently to creep into every conversation, particularly after it tanked the stock
market the previous week, didn't make it past the doors of the church. Nobody wore a mask or kept their distance, and for
the most part nobody even talked about the novel coronavirus. It had only started to trickle into the United States, as far
as anybody knew, and the few cases in Illinois were said to be isolated and controlled.
A top health official had a week earlier assured Chicagoans that ""the health risk to the general public from novel
coronavirus remains low,"" and the outlook from the highest levels of government was that, nationally, the few instances of
the virus were disappearing. President Donald Trump had said three days earlier there were 15 cases in the country, and
""the 15 within a couple of days is going to be down to close to zero.""
In a room off to the side of the church, people sipped soft drinks and picked at a spread catered by a neighborhood chef:
finger sandwiches, sliders, fruit and cheese, chicken and Angeli's favorite dessert, cheesecake. This room was where her
father, Charles Dungill, spent most of the event.

Everybody called him ""Cookie,"" a throwback to his days as a drummer in a family band that toured everywhere Black
performers were allowed in Jim Crow's America. Cookie shook hands, hugged and chatted with relatives and friends, some
of whom had traveled from California, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio and Nevada. A family friend was fresh off a golfing trip to
Arizona and another had recently returned from South Africa.
It was the West Chatham diaspora, a testament to the lasting bonds of the tight-knit Chicago neighborhood in which
Cookie and his wife, Barbara, had raised Angeli and her three surviving siblings: brothers Sevil and Kyann, and sister Gina.
A couple of days after the celebration at the church, Sevil stopped by Cookie's house to check on him. The kids were
worried about their dad. They'd noticed little changes in his appearance: a slight droop to his posture, something different
in his eyes.
It wasn't just his daughter's death with which he was reckoning. Barbara, his wife of 63 years, had died less than a week
before Angeli's celebration, after suffering from multiple ailments, including cancer.
But Sevil found his dad in good enough spirits, having enjoyed the event at Pullman so much that he wanted to plan the
same thing for Barbara. Father and son chatted for about three hours, during which Sevil noticed that his dad had a slight
hitch in his throat.
Probably post-nasal drip.
The next day after work, Sevil was driving back to his dad's house, bringing him Barbara's ashes from the crematorium,
when he realized: Now he had a little cough, too.
""You know, just a hee-mmh,"" Sevil later recalled.
***
Before the nearly 300,000 deaths, the widespread financial devastation, the isolation from loved ones and the fatigue of a
daily disaster with no clear end, there was this: A tickle in a throat in Chicago. A woman's sudden crash to the floor of her
kitchen in the Bay Area. A playwright in Manhattan with three-quarters of a lung left in his chest, sensing doom and fleeing
down the coast with his husband.
The virus shouldn't have been able to sneak up on the United States. The world's most powerful nation, historically among
the most successful at stymieing infectious illnesses, had ample lead time during which the deadly pandemic was
rampaging through Asia, and then Europe.
But in an early vacuum of leadership at almost every government level, with the message from the White House that the
virus was not anything to worry about, Americans unwittingly spread the lethal virus to loved ones and strangers alike.
The U.S. squandered its early advantage. Roughly one year after the virus first came into existence, the country has
suffered a loss of life far worse than any other.
Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician and professor at Brown University, said COVID-19's traits made it a formidable
opponent for even those large nations most competent at fighting it.
But, she added, in the United States in 2020, the virus found an ideal victim. ""The virus could not have emerged at a
better time for spread than this year,"" Ranney said. ""We were in an election year. We had a president who didn't believe in
science. We had underfunding of our public health institutions. It was a perfect storm.""
In an effort to better understand how the virus exploited the country's strengths and exposed its weaknesses, USA TODAY
interviewed biologists and studied scientific genomic analysis, federal reports concerning super-spreading events, county
medical examiner's data from around the country, and state-level death and infection data.
Reporters used those sources to find and report the stories, many of them previously untold, of Americans in the path of
the virus.
What emerges is a portrait of misinformation and confusion leading to a devastating failure to unite against a common

threat.
Piecemeal policies offered a dangerously hollow illusion of control and safety. Scientists, intermittently ignored and
villainized, were powerless. As citizens protested and rioted in response to racist police tactics, others detected a more
subtle form of prejudice in apathy toward a virus that disproportionately sickened Black and Brown Americans. Early
ignorance about the spread metastasized into partisan conspiracy-mongering and threats, leading to that most
American phenomenon: a health official with a bulletproof vest.
The novel coronavirus didn't start in the United States, but we have made it our own.
MLK Jr. Day: Zero official deaths
On Jan. 23, Dr. Benhur Lee stayed up late in his Manhattan apartment, working through the global ramifications of the
virus Americans had been told was not a threat to them.
""We have it totally under control,"" Trump had said the day before when asked about the single known case in the United
States. ""It's one person, coming in from China.""
But none of the early epidemiological research Lee was picking up from China, where the virus had killed thousands and
brought life to a standstill, suggested that assessment was correct.
Lee runs a research lab at Mount Sinai's medical school in New York City. He made a name for himself as an HIV
researcher in the early 2000s before moving on to tracking emerging viruses, becoming an expert on viruses such as
nipah, the bat-borne sickness featured in the film ""Contagion.""
Lee was one of thousands of scientists throughout the world who had since December been piecing together small
studies from doctors in other countries to understand the features of the virus that had emerged in Wuhan, with their
clues as to how it could be stopped.
In early January, scientists from China and Australia released an initial genome sequence of the virus. It closely
resembled SARS, the virus that much of the world barely dodged two decades earlier. And on this Thursday night, Lee
couldn't sleep because scientists had just released new findings estimating the human-to-human spread of the novel
coronavirus.
It was as infectious as Ebola, slightly less infectious than the 1918 Spanish flu, and much less infectious than HIV and
malaria. Lee tried to put the data in context by tweet. Over next few months, his Twitter account – @VirusWhisperer –
would gain tens of thousands of followers.
Lee knew that the United States had previously benefited from a mix of luck and coordination between U.S. agencies
and their international counterparts in stemming SARS and Ebola. That history was cold comfort to Lee, who knew that
the factors making a virus dangerous were difficult to predict.
The scientific community was not yet in agreement that the virus was capable of asymptomatic spread. Because carriers
often don't know they have it and in turn don't isolate, asymptomatic spread is a boon for a virus's rate of infection.
Lee didn't need a double-blind study to determine what was happening. The way the virus had blitzed across China was
evidence enough.
""There was obviously asymptomatic transmission going on,"" Lee said.
Over the next few weeks, Lee would witness a study in contrasts in how seriously major nations were taking the novel
coronavirus. On Jan. 25, he left for a microbiology conference in Sydney, stopping on the way in his home country of
Singapore. It was the beginning of the Year of the Rat, and Lee was celebrating the holiday with a visit to his parents.
He landed just as news broke that Singapore had its first confirmed case, in a traveler from Wuhan. Officials with latex
gloves and temperature guns checked for fever as he disembarked and boarded, and travelers from the Chinese
province that includes Wuhan were barred from entering the country.

By the time Lee returned to the United States on Feb. 3, there were confirmed cases on both coasts and in the
Midwest, and officials were announcing new ones every couple of days.
As he disembarked in Newark, New Jersey, Lee readied for the temperature check, the symptom screening, even the
racial profiling of an Asian traveler.
Instead, he checked in at a digital kiosk just as he always did. There was no temperature check. The border official
welcomed him into the country with no screening questions.
As he rolled his luggage out of the airport, Lee thought, That's not good.
***
For Dr. Jeff Smith, the top administrative official of Santa Clara County in California's Bay Area, it was a forgettable
topic of conversation, just one spouse griping about work to another.
In December 2019, Smith – who in addition to being county executive is also a medical doctor and a lawyer – was
chatting with his wife, a primary care doctor befuddled recently by an influx of patients seeking treatment for flu-like
symptoms, including coughing, achiness and fever. But when she tested for influenza, it came back negative.
Smith had no reason to think much of it.
""It was just a matter of, 'Well, gee, there's people that are sick, and it's a variant of the flu that doesn't show up on
the flu test,'"" the county executive later said.
By mid-January, the novel coronavirus was still just a slightly ominous curiosity to most Americans.
The first U.S. news reports about the virus, published earlier that month, were full of unanswered questions and
mistaken reports from China, including the initial belief that the virus could not be passed between humans.
Life proceeded as normal. San Francisco's international airport was one of two in the United States that had direct
flights to and from Wuhan. But members of the San Francisco Airport Commission, which oversees its operations,
showed no concern throughout January that it was an open portal for travelers from the viral epicenter.
A review of the commission's meetings that month showed that its members never discussed the novel coronavirus.
The government body was instead immersed in its own drama: A restaurateur had been charged with attempting to
give one of the commission members a $5,000 bribe to open a rotisserie chicken joint in the airport.
In the meantime, during the month of January, more than 2,400 passengers flew direct from Wuhan to San Francisco
on China Southern Airlines Flight CZ659, according to a USA TODAY analysis of data on the VariFlight app.
When a member of the airport commission finally did address the virus in early February, it was to urge travelers not
to change their plans for Chinese New Year, a holiday during which people often traveled abroad to visit their families.
""I think it's important for us to continue these celebrations knowing that professionals and government are really
taking the right precautions,"" commissioner Malcolm Yeung said at the time.
The dynamics make the Bay Area a good case study for how the virus was allowed in unchecked.
On Jan. 19, tens of thousands of fans packed Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara for a major sports event: The NFL's
conference championship game between the hometown San Francisco 49ers and the Green Bay Packers. The winner
would go to the Super Bowl.
At the time, most Americans knew relatively little about the novel coronavirus. The Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention hadn't announced any cases in the United States.
Fans flew in from all over the country to attend the game. Masks and social distancing were not yet part of everyday
life.

Besides the few hours spent in the open-air stadium, fans stayed at hotels, ate at restaurants and shopped at
stores in the surrounding Santa Clara County, population 1.8 million.
It's impossible to draw a straight line from an event like this to a coronavirus outbreak without contact tracing, a
non-factor at the time. But around the area, there were deaths unattributed to COVID-19 that seem suspicious in
hindsight. Like a senior living home resident — stricken with symptoms including a persistent fever — whose
family was stunned by her sudden decline.
Or the previously healthy 57-year-old woman who collapsed in her kitchen.
County health officials assured residents they had no reason to worry about COVID-19, even as coroners listed
causes of deaths as ""pending,"" sometimes for months.
On the same day as the championship game, a 98-year-old woman named Marjorie Waggoner lay in a hospice bed
at a senior living center 14 miles away in San Jose, with a cold towel folded over her forehead as a measure
against the fever that had plagued her for more than a week.
When her daughter Darryl Ospring took a photo of her that day, Waggoner was unconscious, scrawny and hollow-
eyed. It was a dramatic change from how she looked less than two months earlier, in a photo Ospring took around
Christmas.
Waggoner, who her kids said always seemed decades younger than she was, wore carefully coiffed short curly hair,
a cheesy holiday sweater, a necklace made of bells, and a big, childlike grin. She suffered from Alzheimer's and
had been in hospice for a year following a series of falls, but she was faring so well that administrators were
considering returning her to normal care.
But on Jan. 8, Waggoner was tired and had no appetite. Within a few days, she had developed a cough, and then a
fever, and her condition rapidly spiraled from there. She died on Jan. 22.
Ospring was surprised by the cause listed on the death certificate – ""complications from neurodegenerative
disease"" – given that her mother's nurse had told her before she died that her chief ailment was her persistent
fever.
Waggoner was not autopsied, and Ospring honored her request to be cremated, even if it ruined her chance at
ever getting clear answers.
""I was trying to understand what happened to my mother in this small window of time,"" she said. ""It was as if the
Angel of Death just came in and ushered her out.""
Unbeknownst to Ospring, she was not alone among residents of her county in being blindsided by the sudden
demise of a loved one without a clear medical explanation.
On Feb. 6, a healthy 57-year-old named Patricia Cabello Dowd collapsed dead in her kitchen, the victim of what
was initially declared a ruptured heart.
Twelve days later, 69-year-old Filipino immigrant Arturo Difuntorum Rivera was found partially decomposed in the
home where he lived alone. For months, the medical examiner listed his cause of death as ""pending.""
Their lives had no obvious overlap, and they occupied different social strata. Dowd was a manager at a
semiconductor company that required regular international travel, though she hadn't been overseas recently.
Rivera was a security guard, who in recent employment at a hotel earned $14 an hour.
Neither was administered a blood test for COVID-19, and officially, there was no chance their deaths were related
to the virus. That's because Santa Clara County's top health officials were unequivocal at the time in declaring that
the virus was not spreading there.
At a public meeting Feb. 19, the county's public health chief, Sara Cody, said there was no reason for residents to
wear masks, cancel gatherings or seek testing for the virus if they were showing symptoms.

Cody said the county had only two confirmed cases, and both were travelers from Wuhan who had been ordered
to isolate.
""If somebody's not had travel to mainland China, we don't consider them a risk for COVID-19 and don't test,""
said Cody, who projected a message reading:
. On the day of Dowd's death, there was a single novel coronavirus test administered in all of Santa Clara
County, according to county data. On the date of Rivera's death, there were two tests. The county didn't top
1,000 tests a day until late April.
It wasn't until April 22 that the veil was partially lifted on what had been missed months earlier. Chief health
officer Cody held a press conference announcing that posthumous tests had revealed that three deaths months
earlier – those of Dowd, Rivera and a 70-year-old Filipino man named Rolando Olaguer – were actually due to
COVID-19.
Cody called them ""iceberg tips"" of an unseen outbreak. Dowd became the earliest confirmed casualty of the
virus in the United States, pre-dating a Seattle-area death on Feb. 28.
For county executive Smith, the revelation of early COVID-19 deaths made for a painful confirmation that his
county's policies had allowed residents to unknowingly infect and kill each other. He said his greatest regret was
trusting the CDC's guidance that there was no need for testing unless a person had symptoms and recent travel
to Wuhan. Similar frustrations were expressed by health officials around the U.S. who felt the CDC, previously
considered the world's premier health agency, had failed the country due to egregious missteps and
misinformation.
""I firmly believe that if the federal government had dealt with this appropriately, that many, many hundreds of
thousands of Americans would not have died,"" Smith said.
He's thought back to those conversations with his wife in December, during which she told him about patients
who had flu-like symptoms but tested negative for the flu. (Smith's wife, who works for a private corporation,
declined to be interviewed, citing medical privacy concerns.)
He now suspects that those patients had COVID-19, and that the virus has been circulating in his county since
December. It's a theory supported by academic research suggesting that the virus was in the U.S. then,
including a UCLA study that revealed a major spike in patients with coughs and acute respiratory failure in the
final month of 2019.
***
At the same time COVID-19 was spreading unseen through northern California, it was gaining a similar foothold
in other regions throughout the country.
For Sevil Dungill in Chicago, his family's battle – and to an extent his city's – with the virus began with thin-
crust pizza and embraces of condolence from an old family friend.
It was Feb. 28, the night before the celebration of Dungill's late sister, and the friend brought him a pie from
Home Run Inn.
They sat close together and, as they reached for slices of pizza, they lingered on everything but the novel
coronavirus. Following the deaths of Dungill's sister and mother, the friend seemed to understand he could use a
few-hour respite from talk of sickness.
Dungill's friend wasn't married and had no children. Instead he filled his life with extended families: his own,
and those of which he was an honorary member. Every Thanksgiving he stopped by to visit the Dungills, and he
called Sevil's elderly parents on their birthdays every year.
Dungill's friend had recently had a little scare with the virus. He had briefly lost his senses of taste and smell.
The friend, who USA TODAY is not naming because he declined to be interviewed, had been golfing in Arizona,

where there were a handful of confirmed cases.
He knew the loss of those senses was a symptom. But his doctor prescribed him a steroid and assured him it
was just his asthma acting up.
By the time Dungill's friend hugged him goodbye, saying he'd see him at his sister's celebration the next day,
whatever bug that seemed to have been bothering him was gone except for a mild case of the sniffles.
***
Less than two weeks later, at around 7 a.m. on March 11, Dungill sat in the emergency room waiting area of
the Advocate Christ Medical Center.
Six others were also there seeking medical attention.
Dungill's illness had started about a week after his sister's celebration. He had been at his office when, while
reaching for a sweater, he realized he was freezing, while his eyes and forehead were burning.
""Hey, if a miracle happens, I'll be at work tomorrow,"" Dungill announced to his boss after toggling on his out-
of-office email message. ""Otherwise, I'm out sick.""
He made it back to his office after a couple of days off, but his fever persisted. His co-workers commented on
how terrible he looked.
When it hurt to breathe, Dungill relented and had his wife drop him off at the emergency room.
The admitting medical personnel appeared unconcerned that his symptoms were related to the novel
coronavirus. Though they gave Dungill a mask, none of the nurses or doctors wore any personal protective
equipment themselves.
They told Dungill they couldn't check for novel coronavirus. At the time, the CDC was only advising tests in
cases that fit narrow parameters, such as if the person had traveled to mainland China.
However, because the doctors were concerned about blood clotting, they had Dungill undergo a CT scan.
The doctor who brought the results to Dungill's hospital bed donned a jarring get-up, now including a face
mask and goggles.
The doctor explained that medical officials in China had reported that X-rayed images of the lungs of those
infected with the novel coronavirus often displayed damage that looked like a starry night or a cobweb.
Dungill's scans showed the same patterns.
Dungill blurted out a number: 845. It was the room in the same hospital where his dad was also laid up.
Cookie Dungill was dealing with his own persistent symptoms that doctors struggled to decipher. He had
initially shown up to the hospital due to constipation causing stomach-clenching discomfort, but he had been
sent home, diagnosed with a bad case of gas.
After the pain got even worse, he called an ambulance to take him back to the hospital. Even though one of
the symptoms of COVID-19 was abdominal pain, the hospital had apparently ruled it out without a test. They
had him share a room with a fellow patient.
Sevil said he urged his doctor to run the same CT scans on his father, and they came back with the similar
telltale pattern. It kicked off chaos in Advocate Christ.
Nurses and doctors who had treated both Dungill men without protection were sent home. According to a
later medical report, Cookie's ""12 attending nurses were also tested and were positive for COVID-19 and
quarantined.""

A spokesperson for Advocate Christ said they couldn't comment directly on this case, but that their staff
""consistently followed CDC guidance, which evolved as public health experts learned more about the virus
and its transmission,"" and that they required masks within the hospital starting March 31.
The doctors ultimately kept Cookie hospitalized but sent Sevil to the waiting area so his wife could pick him
up and take him home.
It was 11:44 p.m., about 17 hours after Sevil had first arrived at the hospital. The room was now crowded
with patients with symptoms just like his: red eyes and dry coughs and painful-sounding wheezes.
Everybody had been given masks.
Sevil again took a tally. He stopped counting at 80.
***
The scientist Benhur Lee spent the first few months of 2020 trying to get people to fathom the severity of
the virus already coursing through the country.
In mid-February, Lee bought Lysol spray, disinfecting wipes, and – even though the CDC was discouraging
them – medical face masks.
Lee found it reprehensible that the agency was advising Americans against wearing masks and claiming
that they were ineffective when scientists had long considered them a weapon against infection. So Lee
carried with him a bag of masks and handed them out to strangers on the streets and subways of New
York City.
He persuaded the doormen of his building to erect a plexiglass barrier between their desks and the lobby.
He tried to convince colleagues – who were all scientists – that they were underestimating the virus. He
joined a few dozen scientists who wrote a letter to New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio urging him to close
schools.
Lee's public health tweets got him branded as an alarmist. His inbox filled with threats or anti-Asian slurs,
spurring Lee to take a hiatus from Twitter.
And then, in the second week of March – the same week that the World Health Organization declared the
virus to be a pandemic – reality seemed to finally, if only partially, set in for the United States.
In a span of two days, the National Basketball Association suspended its season. Tom Hanks announced
that he had COVID-19. And Trump declared a national emergency while banning many Europeans from
entering the United States, adding to a partial ban on some foreign nationals who had visited China.
Lee's employer, Mount Sinai, closed all biology labs, except for those doing research related to COVID-19.
Lee pivoted to making an ingredient to test people's blood for the virus.
The emergency declaration was, in the estimation of international scientists, long overdue, coming six
weeks after the WHO had already declared the virus to be a global public health emergency.
Americans around the country would soon enter lockdowns. It was a fearful and painful moment, but also
one where the damage from previous inaction was not yet set, said Ranney, the doctor and professor. She
said that the federal government could have attempted to catch up on infrastructures for testing, contact
tracing, and distributing PPE.
""But we didn't,"" she said.
Easter: 27,342 deaths
On March 17, two men hustled into a nearly-empty rest stop in Maryland. Four hours into their 1,200-mile
drive from New York to Florida, they realized they weren't going to make it on sandwiches and PowerBars

alone, and stopped to fortify with Wendy's cheeseburgers.
One of the men was middle-aged and svelte. The other was more than two decades older, hobbled but
still sprightly, with an oxygen tank piped to his nose and slung over his shoulder like a school bag. They
wore face masks weeks before the CDC recommended them, and latex gloves.
As they exited the rest stop for the highway, Tom Kirdahy, then 56, and Terrence McNally, 81, felt safer
with each mile they put between themselves and New York. It was as if they could feel the virus
receding behind them.
They were near the front of a great informal migration southward from the New York City area.
While other countries instituted national lockdown orders to freeze citizens and the virus in place, the
United States had only localized, and relatively lax, versions of such edicts. Americans responded by
moving more than ever.
McNally fled New York with husband Kirdahy because he had only three-quarters of a lung left and was
terrified the virus would make quick work of him.
The couple's history together had another pandemic as a backdrop. In 1995, Kirdahy, an attorney
representing those infected with HIV and AIDS, was transfixed in a Broadway theater as he watched a
gay male character kiss a purple scar on the chest of another.
In Kirdahy's view, society had decided that eradicating the AIDS epidemic was not a priority because
those it was killing, mostly gay men, were considered no great loss.
He had held the hands of many gay men as they died without the presence of family members who
were afraid of infection or disdainful of their sexuality.
So attending ""Love! Valour! Compassion!"" written by McNally, whom Kirdahy then only knew as a famed
playwright, was ""like being in church,"" he said.
It was the story of eight gay men on vacation together, including one, played by Nathan Lane, who
kissed the AIDS lesion of another. Kirdahy and his companions at the theater, all of whom worked on the
AIDS front lines or were infected with the virus, wept and hugged each other.
Kirdahy, a lifelong theater buff, met McNally six years later after inviting him to join a panel of famed
gay playwrights he organized in the Hamptons, New York. They bonded over a shared familiarity with
AIDS. Two of McNally's previous partners had died of the virus, and the playwright had seen firsthand
the isolation suffered by its victims in their last moments.
They married in 2003, with Kirdahy warning that he wasn't going to shelve his ambition and become
""Mrs. McNally."" He ultimately left his law practice to become one of the most prolific theater producers
on Broadway and London's West End, racking up armfuls of theater awards to rival those of his
husband.
But a diagnosis only months after they had started dating injected their relationship with a perpetually
fleeting quality. McNally's former three-pack-a-day smoking habit had stricken him with lung cancer.
Surgery left him with a quarter of his right lung and only half of his left. For decades he was in and out
of the hospital, including with potentially life-ending bouts of pneumonia.
McNally made light of it. When he and Kirdahy bought a vacation apartment in Sarasota, Florida, in
2017, McNally predicted he would die there. ""I know how this story ends,"" he joked.
And in June 2019, when he was awarded a Tony for lifetime achievement, he accepted it with his oxygen
tank attached and told the crowd: ""Not a moment too soon.""
During the first weeks of March, when it became clear that New York City was usurping the Seattle area

as a national epicenter of coronavirus, they made hasty plans to drive to the apartment in Florida
until its spread blew over.
At a roadside motel room in North Carolina, they napalmed every surface with Clorox and Lysol. In
Georgia the next day, lunch was sandwiches handed off between latex-covered fingers at a Starbucks
drive-through.
By dusk on the 18th, they were on their balcony rocking chairs in Sarasota, watching the sky turn a
bruised pink over the Gulf of Mexico. McNally's health had worsened, as he had grown weaker and
short of breath. But he preferred sipping seltzer with his husband than more time in a hospital.
On the evening of March 20, McNally said, for the first time in their relationship: ""I want to talk about
dying.""
What followed was a long conversation, ranging from nuts-and-bolts estate planning to spiritual
matters.
""We talked about family and friends and art and nature and gratitude,"" Kirdahy said. ""A lot about
gratitude.""
At 9:21 the next morning, Kirdahy called 911 to report that his husband was coughing up blood.
***
Five days before Kirdahy's 911 call, Cookie Dungill called Sevil from his Chicago hospital room with a
sudden concern.
Cookie couldn't remember if he had paid his bills that month. He asked his son to head over to his
house and make sure he was up to date on his gas and lights.
Sevil had for the last week been suffering an odyssey of severe symptoms from his own bout of
COVID-19. He isolated on the first floor of his home, wearing a mask and leaving the second floor to
his teenage son and wife, who brought him trays of food and stayed six feet away.
He had pneumonia, diarrhea and such severe night sweats that he had to get up in the middle of the
night to change his soaked shirt.
But because he didn't want his dad to worry about his own poor health, he agreed to check on his
bills. He dragged himself out to his car, made it to his father's house and slumped in front of the
computer with Cookie on the phone.
It took them 21/2 hours to puzzle through usernames and passwords to ascertain that Cookie had in
fact paid his bills before he was hospitalized. They wheezed with laughter at their own ineptitude.
""Dad, don't worry,"" Sevil said. ""We're going to make it.""
Cookie called again a few days later, but this time his son couldn't pick up. He was on the other line
with an official from the CDC, who was pumping him with detailed questions about his movements
and interactions in the previous two weeks.
The official wanted to know everything about the pizza dinner Sevil shared with his friend. He wanted
to know who was in what rooms of the church the next day, who shook hands and hugged, and who
ate from the buffet.
The health agency was following a cluster of Chicago cases that hinged on a single event: Angeli's
Joyous Celebration. The CDC was in the midst of declaring it one of the country's earliest and most
severe coronavirus spreading events, likely infecting at least 16 people.
And at its center was a single individual, Sevil's friend, whom the CDC believed had brought the virus

from Arizona. The friend had gone to a birthday party a few days after the funeral and apparently
spread the virus to family members, according to the CDC. The virus then spread further when
those family members went to sermon at a packed church, complete with a collection plate as a
possible vector.
Even without the call from the health official, Sevil's vicinity to the epicenter of the spread of the
virus in Chicago was already clear to him.
On March 16, his friend's sister died. A warm, boisterous woman known for singing in church, she
was the first official novel coronavirus death in Illinois. His friend lost another sister to the virus
less than two weeks later.
When Sevil got off the phone with the contact tracer, he went to call Cookie back at the hospital.
But his father was by then unconscious, having been put on a ventilator.
Sevil later learned from his sister Gina the words that were among his last.
Cookie had called her to say the hospital staff was urging him to go on the ventilator not because
he needed it yet, but because he was experiencing labored breathing and the staff didn't want to
have run out of them when he did need one.
It was a reasoning common earlier in the pandemic that medical experts now regret, following
studies showing that ventilators were overused and might have contributed to a higher death rate.
Gina encouraged him to follow the doctors' recommendations, optimistic that it would help him
recover. Though he agreed, she later said she could hear the fear in his voice.
""I don't want to die,"" he told her.
***
USA TODAY shared with Ranney, the emergency physician and Brown University professor, the
stories of both the Dungills in Chicago and the ailing playwright McNally's sojourn to Florida.
Ranney said that the thread that ran through both of their cases was that they had been failed by
the government. A dearth of testing, medical equipment, and sound scientific guidance had
abandoned them, like thousands of other Americans, to fumble alone through infection with a
deadly virus.
Even if the government had handled the pandemic well, Ranney said, the virus still would have
ripped a deadly course through the country.
""But it would've provided guidance to people like that man on what to do,"" she said, referring to
McNally. ""It would have allowed him to get a test. And it would have kept people from having that
abject fear that led them to flee, and to bring the virus with them.""
After his husband, Kirdahy, called 911 to report that he was coughing up blood, McNally was taken
to a Sarasota hospital. He was isolated and, within a couple of days, put on a ventilator. After a
COVID-19 test came back positive and his oxygen levels dipped dangerously, Kirdahy made the
decision to take him off of the ventilator.
Kirdahy's promise to his husband that he'd be holding his hand while he died weighed heavily on
him. He asked the doctors whether he could enter his hospital room, and they allowed him.
""I'm one of the lucky ones,"" Kirdahy said of being able to say goodbye. He would later test positive
for virus antibodies, suggesting he was an asymptomatic carrier.

There was a window of opportunity in early spring — before Americans were dug intractably into
separate trenches, before wearing a face mask had somehow become a defining political issue,
and militia members were caught allegedly plotting to kidnap the Michigan governor over
lockdown orders — when the country could have unified in order to beat back the virus.
""People were willing to listen to public health officials, and they were willing to take
precautions,"" Ranney said. ""We squandered that.""
Part of the problem was the contradictory messages coming from government officials. The CDC
recommended masks in early spring after months of advising against them, and elected leaders
clashed over state and local rules — like whether to close Georgia's beaches — in the absence of
a clear national edict.
Such at-odds approaches made it feel like safety measures were the whims of public officials,
often determined by their political alignment.
The deepening political entrenchment was led by the president. Trump mocked face coverings
even after his government recommended them. He publicly undermined Dr. Anthony Fauci, the
government's top infectious disease expert. He called COVID-19 the ""China virus"" in spite of
increased attacks against Asian Americans. And he made an axiom of declaring that the cure —
lockdowns recommended by top members of his own national health team — was worse than
the virus itself.
The division thrust into the spotlight government doctors, the kind of career public servants
whose names the average constituent might never otherwise learn.
Scott Harris, Alabama's state health officer, said he decided to go into public health after two
decades in his private practice in Decatur observing how illnesses hit his Black patients harder.
""If public health exists for one reason it's to promote health equity,"" said Harris, a soft-spoken
physician.
Harris encountered the politicization immediately after his state had its first official case, on
March 13. Alabamians in his inbox challenged his counting of ""presumed"" cases, which follow a
positive test, versus cases that the CDC reviewed and confirmed.
Later that month, Harris's staff debated how to classify one of the state's first deaths involving a
positive test for COVID-19. The decedent was a young person who had a stroke while infected
with the virus. In a deeply-red state under a Republican governor, Kay Ivey, Harris said his staff
ultimately reported it as ""death by stroke, in a person who also had Covid.""
""And then, within a couple months, it became clear that's one way people with COVID die,""
Harris later said.
""At that time there was all this pressure — well still is, this pressure,"" Harris said. ""These
pressures to minimize what's actually going on, and people were hyper-alert to try to make sure
we counted our cases correctly.""
The hostility continued after the governor issued a stay-at-home order on April 3, in response to
a crisis of overwhelmed hospital beds, infected health-care workers and a rising death count in
nursing homes.
Emailers lectured him on states' rights and personal liberty, and sent Benjamin Franklin's
Revolutionary War cartoon reading, ""Join, or Die."" Even when email called him a dictator, Harris
looked to see if they contained legitimate questions, and forwarded those messages to his staff
so the experts could educate them.
Others explicitly threatened him. ""I'm going to show up at your house, and you better watch out

because I know where you live,"" one person wrote.
The state gave Harris an around-the-clock security detail and a ballistic vest. They told him to
fling it on and lock his door if he heard a loud noise.
Harris's experiences were not unique: State health officers around the country experienced
similar treatment, with hundreds facing threats or resigning.
***
Ivey's change in policy made Alabama one of the first states to lift restrictions following
encouragement from Trump, who by mid-April had called for states to reopen their
economies.
After the Alabama governor gave up the lectern to Harris, he struck a markedly different
tone. His mask down around his chin, Harris spoke soberly about data emerging in Alabama,
as it was throughout the country, that showed that the virus disproportionately impacted
Black and Hispanic Americans. Black Alabamians represented a quarter of the state but half of
its COVID-19 deaths to that point.
The decision to reopen most of Alabama may have been welcome to many residents,
including business owners. To Linda Gilchrist, a nurse who works at a Montgomery senior
home, it was devastating. After finishing a shift — followed by a lengthy clothes-washing and
showering routine so as to not infect her family — she caught Ivey's press conference on
television.
Dozens of Gilchrist's patients had died from the virus, and she had stood in a meeting that
day where stakeholders discussed getting more patients into the rehab unit. In Montgomery,
coronavirus cases had been steadily rising. Ivey's policy change certainly wasn't based on the
state having flattened the curve.
""Oh my God,"" Gilchrist thought to herself. ""Why are we doing this?""
William Boyd, a lifelong resident of deeply segregated, majority-Black Montgomery, thought
he had an explanation. Boyd had lost six relatives or close friends to the virus, including his
brother. He saw the growing apathy toward the virus in Alabama as a result of policy-makers
learning that Black people were most vulnerable. The CDC had just come out with that
information on April 8.
The hospital where Boyd's brother died had a policy allowing loved ones access if they were
near death, and he described sharing a waiting area with those who were about to say
goodbye to a patient. ""It was an ugly sight, and I saw all Black people,"" Boyd said.
Boyd addressed the Montgomery City Council in June when they considered a mask mandate.
""The question on the table is whether Black lives matter,"" he said. The mandate failed after
the eight-member council voted mostly along racial lines, Black members for the mandate
and white members against it.
The next month, the Montgomery council members reversed themselves and passed the
mandate. Ivey also revisited the statewide mask issue during another press conference,
roughly six weeks after the one where she'd cracked the joke about her hairdresser. Harris
was back at her side.
Cases in Alabama had more than doubled in the month before the announcement, to more
than 60,000, adding more than 1,100 cases per day on average.

The unique rub of the novel coronavirus is that attempts to defeat it tend to open up
another front of misery. Extended lockdowns deliver their own world of grief, as the
millions of newly unemployed Americans can attest. The tug-of-war between industry and
public health has often resulted in public policy that keeps the economy afloat at the
expense of the health, and often lives, of those with the least agency.
Nowhere has that been more clear than in the federal government's handling of the
meatpacking crisis.
In mid-April, Minnesota hog farmer Greg Boerboom heard from a representative of
Smithfield Foods that the meat conglomerate had to delay its weekly purchase of several
semi loads of his animals due to illness at the company's Sioux Falls plant.
But Boerboom wasn't worried the disruption would extend any longer than a few days. The
meat industry had eradicated uncertainty a long time ago. Boerboom contracts with the
few multinational corporations that control the meat processing industry. It's a departure
from the system he learned as a young man on his father's farm, where they'd haul 30
hogs at a time behind their '59 Chevrolet three hours away to the stockyards in St. Paul to
search for buyers.
Critics deride the ruthless efficiency of the business but Boerboom, 59, sees progress. ""We
can glamorize the good old days,"" he said, ""but the fact of the matter is they weren't that
glamorous.""
But the drawbacks of the modern meatpacking model began to show when a
representative for Tyson Foods also called Boerboom to say COVID-19 cases were forcing
the temporary closure of the company's plant in Waterloo, Iowa.
The two plants represented roughly 60% of Boerboom's business. And as a month came
and went, and the plants remained closed, his stock of roughly 100,000 overgrown hogs
crowded against each other in his barns. Boerboom had to consider ways to quickly reduce
his inventory, including whether to execute a large number of them with a handgun.
His colleagues were doing it, those who weren't pumping carbon monoxide into their barns
to kill thousands of their hogs. All across the country, hog farmers faced the same grim
scenario.
***
The virus had forced farmer Greg Boerboom to revert to his dad's old way of doing
business, selling a few hogs here or there and stocking the butcher shops on nearby Main
Streets. But Boerboom isn't the nostalgic type. When the Smithfield and Tyson buyers
returned in late May, he rejoiced and credited Trump's executive order.
The order was a boon for those major corporations, which as it turns out were never at risk
for a severe meat shortage. In fact, a significant portion of the hogs Boerboom sold to
Smithfield and Tyson likely ended up not in American kitchens, but in Chinese ones.
Market data showed that during the period when meatpacking executives were warning
that the food supply chain was breaking, they were exporting millions of tons of meat
overseas – even more than in previous years.
The federal government had prioritized the production of meat over the safety of low-paid,
mostly-immigrant workers. In the months following Trump's executive order, plant
operators claimed to have implemented safety guards such as plexiglass barriers and
mandatory masks. But there was little federal oversight monitoring those measures.
COVID-19 cases in the plants skyrocketed, and often so did the case counts of their
surrounding communities.

As of September, there would be more than 200 deaths among meatpacking workers
who had contracted the virus.
Boerboom thinks the media has mostly ignored the real story, which is post-traumatic
stress and depression he predicts will linger with hog farmers. ""The big story is going to
be the financial and emotional drain to the farming community in small-town America,""
he said.
But he says Trump deserves gratitude for returning the business to the status quo even
in the midst of a pandemic. ""I think that's what saved our industry,"" Boerboom said. ""If
he had not done that, we would be out of business today.""
Thanksgiving: 263,456 deaths
In early April, Gina Jere drove to a cremation center where a man in full protective gear
dropped into her trunk a triple-bagged Hefty containing Cookie Dungill's watch, glasses,
cell phone and a container of his ashes.
When her brother Sevil Dungill learned that their father had died, he was still in the
throes of his own severe sickness, isolated on the first floor of his house.
He kept six feet away as he told his teenage son about Cookie's passing.
""We're not going to grieve right now,"" said Dungill, who was terrified of infecting his wife
and son. ""Because grieving makes you weak.""
Dungill finally left his home after nearly two months of sickness in isolation. He emerged
to a changed world full of face masks and strange new rituals at the supermarket.
Protests and riots then followed and brought shattered storefronts to his Chicago
neighborhood.
Like other families that have lost loved ones this year, it's hard to predict when, if ever,
the Dungills will be able to properly grieve. There was no funeral or memorial for Cookie
Dungill and, considering the results of the family's last gathering to mark a death, there
probably never will be.
For Sevil Dungill, the lack of closure concerning his father's death has also consumed his
perspective on the other family members he lost in 2020. Like Darryl Ospring's fixation
on her mother's January death in the Bay Area, Dungill suspects that COVID-19 was
responsible for the deaths of his sister in January and his mother in February.
Before his family's saga with the illness, he accepted without doubt that their deaths
were a result of cancer.
But he has since thought back on their sudden declines. His sister Angeli was put under
a hospital ventilator before dying, according to her death certificate, of acute respiratory
distress syndrome, pneumonia and metastatic lung cancer. His mother's official cause of
death was aspiration pneumonia and congestive heart failure.
The lung-related conditions are hallmarks of COVID-19 deaths. But Dungill will never
know for sure, since both women were cremated and not autopsied.

Order shielding Asian Americans from hatred gets activists' support
US President Joe Biden on Tuesday signed an executive order to address the rising racism against Asian
Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. The move has been welcomed by advocacy groups as ""a promising
step"".
The executive order, one of four addressing racial equity, directs the Department of Health and Human Services
and the COVID-19 health equity task force to issue guidance on cultural competency, language access and
sensitivity.
It also directs the Department of Justice to engage with the Asian American and Pacific Islander, or AAPI,
community on issues related to hate crimes, hate incidents and harassment.
""The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments
through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic
location of its origin,"" reads the executive order.
""Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI
persons.""

202104,"
Both Thai and those of other nationalities, including Americans, plan to gather in front of the Thai Consulate in Los
Angeles this Sunday, local time, to call for an end to what they claim is racial violence, especially against Asian and
Polynesian Americans, and to mourn the death of an 84-year old Thai man who was fatally injured in California.
The elderly Thai man, Mr. Vicha Rattanapakdi, was taking an exercise walk on Anza Vista Road in San Francisco
when a 19-year old attacked him in what was believed to be an act of racial violence against Asians. The victim
was rushed to a hospital but eventually died on January 30th. The assailant was later arrested by San Francisco
police and has now been charged with murder.
The victim's family and the broader Thai community in the US believe, however, that this was a hate crime, fueled
by racial discrimination against Asian Americans. Donations poured in to raise funds for the funeral of the victim.
After the fatal incident, a campaign was launched on social media in Thailand, calling for equal justice, human
rights protection and declaring opposition to racial hatred and discrimination.
According to a report from the Centre to End Racial Violence against Asian-Americans, violence against Asian and
Polynesian Americans across the US has increased by about 40% since the outbreak of COVID-19. - Thai PBS

Cities across the United States are seeing numerous unprovoked attacks against Asian-Americans, particularly
older people, according to a new study by a coalition documenting and addressing anti-Asian hate and
discrimination.
On January 28 in San Francisco, 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee was knocked to the ground and killed while
walking in his neighborhood. There have been over 20 attacks in Oakland's Chinatown in the past two weeks
that the local Chamber of Commerce considered to be targeted against Asians. On January 31, an assailant
violently knocked a 91-year-old man to the ground and later attacked an older man and woman. On February 3
in New York City, Noel Quintana, 61, was slashed across the face, and on the same day in Oakland, a 71-year-
old grandmother was knocked to the ground while crossing the street and robbed.
Such attacks are not new. On Twitter, the hashtag #VincentChin has surfaced, highlighting historical anti-Asian
xenophobia and racism fueled by the US auto industry decline of the 1980s, leading to the murder of Chinese
American Vincent Chin in Detroit by two men who blamed Asians for their losing their jobs. Neither served
prison time.
Former President Donald Trump fueled anti-Asian sentiment during the Covid-19 pandemic by using
discriminatory rhetoric to describe the coronavirus, and may have contributed to the racist and violent attacks
across the United States. Between March and December 2020, the coalition Stop AAPI Hate documented over
2,800 anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide.

Migrants of colour have often felt like unwelcome outsiders in New Zealand, no matter how long they have lived
here. Mandy Te reports.
As a group of taiko drummers performed at a festival in Porirua, Debbie Donnelly remembers a stranger turning
to her and saying, ""They're not like us.""
Donnelly was the wrong person to pick out of the crowd. For most of her life, she has thought deeply about the
duality of her identity.
When she was younger, people would tell her she had the best of both worlds when it came to being Japanese
and Pakeha. At the time, she didn't know what that meant.
Sitting in her Kapiti home, there's a glint in her eyes as she thinks about her identity, racism, and her mother,
Setsuko.
Setsuko, from the city of Takehara, near Hiroshima, met Mick, a Pakeha man, in Japan through a Catholic priest.
She moved to Wellington in the 1950s, marrying Mick at St Anne's Catholic Church in Newtown. The couple
briefly lived in Masterton before moving to Wellington.
It was in the capital city that Setsuko thrived as an interpreter, meeting prime ministers and the Queen. She
also became a co-founder of the Japanese Society.

Mick was supportive of Setsuko as she pursued her interests.
When it came to the racism, Donnelly says her mother protected her and her siblings from the details, but she
did share anecdotes.
""She felt she was a punching bag for a lot of people [and] a lot of people's frustrations,"" Donnelly says.
""At the time I could only imagine the culture shock, combined with not knowing the language, not knowing what
people are saying about you, but knowing she wasn't being welcomed.""
She believes the racism her mother experienced was linked to anti-Japanese sentiment after the war.
Donnelly's brother, Leo, recalled a moment years after his mother's death when a woman approached him to
apologise for how his mother was treated in Masterton.
""My mother didn't put any blame on anyone, but she was happy to leave, and that was probably because of the
way in which she was spoken about,"" Leo says.
As children, Donnelly and Leo recall experiencing racist taunts signalling to them that ""you're not us"".
The advice Leo got from his parents, and from his mother in particular, was about being resilient - she used The
Great Wave off Kanagawa painting as an example.
""It was not what people thought it may mean, which was 'you can't beat the force of nature'; it was the fact you
bow to the wave but you don't go under,"" Leo says.
""There are some things you can't control but you stay afloat. You work your way up and you work your way
through those situations.""
Nowadays, he sees similar attitudes to the ones he encountered when he was younger come up in pockets -
such as how Asian people have been treated during the Covid-19 pandemic.
When it comes to racism, he says, it's about making it clear that it's unacceptable, while also providing support
for people on the receiving end, to help them cope with the emotional impact.
""People act out of ignorance and fear, but it still doesn't make it right.""
While Setsuko never shied away from her Japanese roots, she considered New Zealand her home and herself a
Kiwi.
Their mother's experience of feeling like a ""punching bag"" and feeling unwelcome is not something she went
through alone.
Living under another's roof
New and old migrants have gone through those feelings - stemming from the concept of being treated as
""forever a foreigner"". Emeritus Professor Manying Ip has studied the ""forever a foreigner"" concept for decades,
mainly in connection to Chinese New Zealanders.
Speaking to Chinese New Zealanders, she noted how they felt out of place - as if they didn't belong.
Using a Chinese saying to define the concept, she says it is about people from minority groups feeling as though
they are living under another person's roof.

It was someone else's place, not theirs, and they would never feel as though they belonged, she says.
University of Auckland senior sociology lecturer Dr David Tokiharu Mayeda says that, when people think about
migrants and what it means to be a migrant, implicit within that are perceptions about migrants of colour.
""It's diverse Pacific communities, Asian communities, Middle Eastern and African communities but it's not
European communities.
""If you're from a European background, you're from a migrant community. Your ancestors may have been
here for a long time, but you're still migrants.""
But ancestors of Pakeha migrants brought with them a level of power, enabling them to change the systems
in Aotearoa to focus on economy and profit. This meant other migrant groups were working within the
confines of systems created by European settlers.
Mayeda noticed this feeling of foreignness trickle into his students' work - particularly in those with Asian
backgrounds - when it came to one assignment that required them to write about their lives.
The Asian students who were born here, or moved here when they were young wrote about distancing
themselves from their families, ""and they will use this terminology - trying to distance themselves from FOBs
(fresh off the boat)"".
More recent Asian migrants wrote about hating themselves and getting depressed about the racial
stereotypes they had started to believe, he says.
Like Asian communities, Pacific communities are extremely diverse - and both umbrella ethnic communities
can face being treated as ""forever foreigner"", Mayeda says.
In the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic, East Asians in particular were cast as ""virus-spreading foreign
threats"", he says. That stereotype then shifted to Aotearoa's Pacific communities in mid-2020.
""In general, however, because Pacific peoples have closer cultural connections to Maori, and geographic
connections to nearby Pacific nations, they tend not to be cast as foreign threats in the same way as Asians.
""Research I've been involved in shows that Pacific peoples are subjected to racism that many Maori
understand - being unfairly suspected as criminogenic, lazy in school and work.
""In contrast, Asians get cast as the distant foreign threats who will take over the economy, housing market
and schools if not kept in check.""
He believes it's important for New Zealand to recognise Maori as tangata whenua, and also that anyone who
is not Maori, including Pakeha, comes from a migrant background.
'All they see us as are sports stars and entertainers'
The University of Auckland's Dr Sereana Naepi says it was ""very telling"" how quickly and easily the rumours
targeting Auckland's Pasifika communities over the August Covid-19 cluster were believed.
One rumour suggested that a woman from a Pasifika family contracted the virus by sneaking into a managed
isolation facility to see a man.
This fed into the ""dusky maiden"" trope stemming from colonial times, which sexualised and objectified Pacific
women.

""People latched on to this fake story of criminals and sex,"" Naepi says.
New Zealand's colonising of the Pacific cemented the colonisers' views of Pacific communities as children to
be taken care of, instead of strong, independent nations capable of caring for themselves.
Colonisers took on an almost paternal role so that Pacific communities were incapable of being seen as a
foreign threat, she adds.
""People are happy to have Pacific communities when they benefit from their labour and cultural capital, but
they're less likely to invest in these communities.
""All they see us as are sports stars and entertainers - in their minds, we have a specific space to fill in New
Zealand society.""
And when this wasn't filled? Pacific communities were labelled as people who did not contribute, as
underachievers and criminals, she says.
Gatekeeping who gets to be kept in and out
Grace Gassin, a researcher and curator of Asian New Zealand histories at Te Papa Tongarewa, says ""for a
lot of New Zealand's history, there's been a desire to keep New Zealand white for lack of a better way to
put it"".
""I guess we're all dealing with the legacies of anti-Chinese discrimination and, broadly, discrimination
against non- whites which happened legislatively, administratively and socially.""
Asian migrants had been around during seminal events and there were also instances of solidarity between
Maori and Asian communities - moments often not heard about when New Zealand history is told.
She mentions Minnie Rose Alloo, a woman of Chinese and Scottish ancestry, as an example of this. Her
signature sits neatly on a suffrage petition in 1893. She was 19 at the time of signing, making her too
young to do so.
Gassin says the way some New Zealand history was written makes it seem as if Pakeha were ""colonial
mediators"".
As the dominant group, they had a central position, which meant they could determine the relationship
between other ethnic groups, she says.
""Pakeha are colonisers here on this land, so it's interesting. You could argue that they're the ultimate
foreigner and migrant in the context of New Zealand history.
""But it's often that dominant group who gets to decide who are the foreigners, and gatekeep who gets to
be kept in and out. They're the ones that get to form a nation's identity.""
After the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, people could enter the country, but those who were not British
were considered aliens.
But throughout history, there have been barriers to prevent people - particularly those of colour - from
coming to New Zealand.
In 1881, immigration restrictions were placed on Chinese people, who had to pay a poll tax to enter.
After World War I, German people, Marxists and socialists were restricted from entering New Zealand.

The 1920 Immigration Restriction Amendment Act, better known as the ""White New Zealand Policy"",
made it difficult for anyone not British to come to New Zealand till the 1970s. Permission had to be
given by the minister of customs.
Chinese migrants were recruited by the Dunedin Chamber of Commerce to work in the Otago goldfields.
The first 12 men arrived from Australia in 1868 and, by late 1869, more than 2000 Chinese men had
come to the goldfields.
Pacific peoples had four waves of migration, dating from 800 to 1000 years ago. The first wave was the
coming of the Maori. The second and third waves were tied to European colonisation of the Pacific, with
people coming to Aotearoa as trainee teachers, missionaries, sailors, whalers and civil servants.
The fourth wave was linked to migration for economic reasons, with Pacific peoples finding work in the
manufacturing and service sectors after World War II.
African Americans arrived in colonial times, but most of the arrivals from Britain's African colonies in the
1870s were white. In the 1960s, black students came to New Zealand through study programmes.
Immigration rules meant very few black people arrived before the 1990s. In 1991, the government
increased the number of refugees, which saw people from Ethiopia, Rwanda, Somalia, Zimbabwe and
other countries move to New Zealand.
In the late 1800s, people from Lebanon migrated to Dunedin, Wellington and Auckland. Other Middle
Eastern groups that moved to New Zealand were Assyrian Christians and refugees from Iraq and Iran
who arrived in the 1990s.
People from Israel, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Jordan and Bahrain
moved to New Zealand in the 2000s.
People of Indian origin have been coming to New Zealand since the late 18th century, often on British
East India Company ships. In the 1890s, Indian migration increased. Pakeha at the time lumped them
with ""Assyrian hawkers"", and there were attempts to create laws against hawker activities and to limit
their immigration.
'There's always a bias'
Waitakere Indian Association president Sunil Kaushal says ""irrespective of whether you're a first or
second generation, there's always a bias"".
""Indians came to New Zealand in the late 18th century and made New Zealand their home, but on the
flip side of it, someone who comes from Europe or America are just seen as Europeans, which is just
'normal Pakeha'.""
People did not ask those of European descent where they came from, he says, which led to an
underlying feeling that Indians were not considered Kiwis.
In 2020, the association commissioned a report to understand the economic significance of people of
Indian ethnicity in New Zealand. It found that 240,000 people of Indian descent contributed $10 billion
to the economy in 2019.
That number is astounding, and shows how much people of Indian origin contribute to New Zealand, but
they are still being put in a box and stigmatised, says Kaushal.
""Is it a myth or is it a reality? I think it's a reality, rather than a myth.

'I feel it in myself'
Veena Patel has Fijian Indian and Pakeha roots. Her family moved from Fiji to New Zealand when she
was 4, after a succession of political coups in the 1980s.
When it comes to her cultural background, she says it can feel difficult to fit in or feel a part of either
of them.
It's not one moment or experience that has made her feel that way, but it's something that strikes
her daily.
""When I say my name, people don't recognise me as having my name,"" she says.""It used to make me
feel like I didn't fit in anywhere and I wanted to minimise or hide my difference to fit in with everyone
else and not be seen to be different in any way.
""As I get older and grow more mature, I've been able to negotiate that for myself. My identity has
been a journey for me, and one of discovery, and I've been lucky enough to have my parents to
explore both sides of myself.""
Patel says identity goes beyond things such as ethnicity, nationality, gender and where you live.
""Your identity and who you see yourself as, especially for culture, that's something you get to define
for yourself. Once you see that and understand that, it's really liberating . . . It doesn't matter
whether people recognise me as Indian any more, because I feel it in myself.""
She feels excited for New Zealand to enter a ""new era of maturity in terms of how we think about our
diversity - how we think about integration as a two-way thing"".
Having a diverse background should be a source of pride, she says. It's not something that has a
bearing on whether people are Kiwi or not, because it is OK to identify with more than one culture.

Jeremy Lin said he will not reveal the person who allegedly called him ""coronavirus"" on the court even after his
accusation set off an investigation by the G League.
""I know this will disappoint some of you but I am not naming or shaming anyone,"" Lin wrote on Twitter Saturday
morning. ""What good does it do for someone in this situation to be torn down?""
The former Knicks sensation, 32, who is trying to resurrect his career in the G league bubble with the Golden
State Warriors affiliate, revealed the ""coronavirus"" incident in a Facebook post Thursday that detailed the fight
against prejudice encountered by himself and other Asian Americans.
""Being a 9 year NBA veteran doesn't protect me from being called 'coronavirus' on the court,"" Lin wrote. ""Being
a man of faith doesn't mean I don't fight for justice, for myself and for others.""
The G League was looking into the claim but Lin said he doesn't see the benefit of outing the alleged offender.
""It doesn't make my community safer or solve any of our long-term problems with racism,"" he wrote.
Lin has long been outspoken about being the subject of stereotypes, but over the last year verbal and physical
attacks on Asian Americans have become more prevalent because the pandemic started in China. Donald Trump,

Actress and anti-hate crime activist Olivia Munn is speaking out after her friend's mom was assaulted outside a
Queens bakery - posting two photos of the alleged attacker on Twitter on Wednesday.
""My friend's mom is a 5'3"" 50+ Chinese woman and she was attacked by this guy in Flushing, NY yesterday on
Main St and Roosevelt between 2-4pm. She left the hospital with 10 stitches in her head,"" the ""X-Men:

""We're gonna find this guy. Queens, Internet, please... do your s--.""
Police have not yet confirmed the photos were of the suspect.
Cops said the 52-year-old victim was standing on line outside a bakery Tuesday when a man in a red jacket and
gray pants started arguing with her, then pushed her. The victim hit her head against an object and the man
fled.
Medics took the victim to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Queens. The attacker remained on the loose as police
continued to investigate, including whether the attack would be considered a hate crime.
In a Facebook post Tuesday night, the victim's daughter Maggie Kayla Cheng called the assault a hate crime.

Police have arrested a suspect in the assault of a Asian woman in Queens that drew the ire of actress and anti-hate
crime activist Olivia Munn, officials said.
Working off a tip, Patrick Mateo was picked up at his Queens home early Thursday and charged with assault and
harassment for shoving the 52-year-old woman - the mother of Munn's friend - during an argument in a bakery at Main
St. and Roosevelt Ave. in Flushing on Tuesday.
The woman struck her head against a newspaper stand, suffering a deep cut to her head, cops said.
Mateo, 47, was not hit with hate-crime charges. Cops found no evidence that he made any anti-Asian statements
during the attack, officials said. He lives a few blocks from the baker.
The ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" star posted two surveillance images of the attacker on Twitter Wednesday as she made a
social media plea to identify the attacker.

City leaders are boosting efforts to fight hate crimes that have targeted Asian New Yorkers, in particular, since
the start of the coronavirus outbreak.
The recent deployment of extra NYPD officers to the subways will focus in part on preventing hate crimes, while
Mayor de Blasio promised meetings with community leaders this week to hear what else the city can do.
""The NYPD is watching to protect folks and stop these horrible actions,"" Hizzoner said at a Tuesday news
conference, after a series of alarming subway incidents prompted the NYPD to send 500 extra cops to stations
and trains this month.
The recent crime streak includes unprovoked attacks on two Asian senior citizens on subways within a 24-hour
span on Feb. 16.
""These racist attacks have been outrageous, unconscionable, disgusting and it must end,"" Rep. Grace Meng (D-
Queens) said at the news conference.
Meng and de Blasio partially blamed former President Donald Trump for fomenting hate through racist language
about coronavirus.

An Asian man stabbed near a Manhattan courthouse needed to have a kidney surgically removed after the
random attack that is now being considered a hate crime, police sources said.
Cops initially said there was no indication of bias in the 6:20 p.m. Thursday stabbing, but later upgraded
charges against Salman Muflihi, 23, to attempted murder as a hate crime and assault as a hate crime.
The victim's wife does not believe hate was the main reason for the crime.
""He's obviously mentally ill,"" she told the Daily News on Friday evening at the loft building where the couple
lives in Chinatown.
""We are concerned that someone so mentally ill is walking around the city,"" said the wife, who asked that her
name not be used. ""Why wasn't he evaluated before this?""
Muflihi, from Brooklyn, said nothing to the 36-year-old victim as he stabbed him from behind with the 8-inch
blade by the Daniel Patrick Moynihan U.S. Courthouse.

Within minutes of being pepper-sprayed in SoHo, Yaeji Kim knew she had been the victim of a random attack -
and possibly a hate crime.
As she made her way home, still crying from the burning in her eyes and temporary blindness, Kim tried to push
the severity of the Feb. 16 incident out of her mind.
Yet the more she thought about the man who rolled down the window of a dark-colored sedan on W. Houston
St. and pointed a canister at her, the more frightened she felt.

202104,"
A crowd of about 200 New Yorkers gathered Saturday in Foley Square to denounce a wave of anti-Asian violence
that they say is fueled by racism and ignorance about the COVID-19 pandemic.
The throng heard community leaders and a parade of top political leaders vow to end the shocking spat of
attacks and seemingly unending torment of slurs that have dramatically worsened during the pandemic.
""We are fighting a global pandemic but we are also fighting racism. ... We are getting spat on, shoved, punched,
slashed, stabbed,"" said Jo-Ann Yoo of the Asian American Federation. ""Right now Asian-Americans are scared,
we are outraged, and we are devastated.""
Mayoral candidate Andrew Yang, one of the nation's best-known Asian politicians, attended the rally but was not
given a speaking spot and left without speaking to reporters.
The crowd gave a rousing reception to Noel Quintana, 61, a Filipino-American who was slashed in the face on
the L train last week. ""A lot of Asian-Americans [are] being attacked everywhere so I just want [people] to know
that this is happening to us,"" he said. ""Almost every day there are attacks and I don't understand why.""
Many New Yorkers were stunned to see a viral video of an Asian-American woman being slammed to the
sidewalk last week in an unprovoked attack in Flushing, Queens.

The year of 2020 was marked by losses.
Long Islanders celebrating the Lunar New Year's Day on Friday are eager to move on from the tumultuous and
tragic year of the Rat and welcome the new year of the Ox with centuries-long traditions that reaffirm their
roots.
Amid a pandemic that brought a rise in anti-Asian discrimination in New York and elsewhere in the country,
there is also hope for a new year that will heal divisions.
The anguish of the past year goes far beyond the Asian community, said Christine Liu, president of the Herricks
Chinese American Association.
""Last year was a year of a lot of hurt physically, emotionally and socially,"" Liu said. ""I feel this new year is one of
hope and healing - healing in terms of everything that's happened in our nation, from the pandemic to the
division politically and socially. This year, I'm looking forward to a more hopeful and united year.""

As the holiday typically invites reflection, three Long Islanders spoke to Newsday of their family rituals and the
new year's outlook.
Yeonwoo Lee
Lunar New Year for Lee, 16, conjures up memories of devouring Tteokguk, a rice cake soup, and sending videos
to her relatives in South Korea of her donning a hanbok, a dress worn in her native country during special
occasions.
The high school sophomore said she was a toddler when she moved to the United States from Seoul, and the
holiday is a way for her to reconnect with her heritage.
""It ties me back to my culture since I've been living in America my whole life,"" Lee said. ""Celebrating the new
year with my family makes me feel more Korean.""
Lee, of Plainview, recalled another holiday custom of receiving money from loved ones. In her family, children
are gifted between $10 and $200, meant to represent a prosperous future, she said.
""I remember receiving money from relatives, and I remember being happy. We have to receive it with two
hands"" as a ""sign of respect,"" she said.
Because of the pandemic, Lee said this year's festivities will be limited to her home with only her immediate
family.
She said the struggles over the past year and yearning for a better future are emblematic in 2021's celebrations
of the year of the Ox, an animal that is said to symbolize hard work and perseverance.
""The pandemic requires a lot of resilience from everyone,"" the teen said.
The COVID-19 crisis, however difficult, has given her a newfound appreciation of her South Korean bloodlines
and the traditions that come with them, she said.
""I often viewed these kinds of family gatherings as an inconvenience. Sometimes, I would rather stay home,""
Lee said. ""I realized how much I took for granted and how much I enjoyed these gatherings. From now on, I will
value them more.""
Wai-Lin Ng
Ng's fondest holiday memories include gatherings with her family in New York City, where she cooked dumplings
for hours while partaking in upbeat conversations.
""The Chinese dumplings - that was always a must-have,"" said Ng, 57, of Sound Beach. ""It was my parents,
aunts and their friends. Dumplings made by hand, it only takes a few minutes to eat them, so you have to
constantly be making them all day.""
Maintaining pleasantries to abide by the holiday spirit of prosperity was a must, Ng said.
""There was always good conversations and never bad words spoken,"" she said, adding it's ""bad luck"" to spoil the
positive vibes.
The pandemic has prompted Ng to pivot away from face-to-face celebrations like cooking traditional meals with
relatives and attending lion dances, in which performers wear an elaborate, colorful head ornament and move to
the rhythms of drumbeats, in Chinatown in Manhattan.

Instead, Ng plans to attend a virtual celebration and video chat with college classmates who live abroad in
countries like Singapore and Japan.
The 2021 Lunar New Year takes on even more significance in the effort to move on from an uptick in hate-
related crimes and reports of discrimination against Asians, Ng said.
She had one such negative encounter last winter at a Rocky Point grocery store. It occurred before masks
became a common protective measure. Ng said a woman stared at her and then pulled her scarf over her
nose and mouth.
She hasn't experienced another similar interaction since, but the moment stuck with her, said Ng, who was
born in Hong Kong and emigrated to the United States when she was a child.
""At the time, I felt a little embarrassed,"" said Ng, who has lived on the Island for most of her adult life. ""I
only realized it when I started to think about all the rhetoric that was going on and why people would do
something like that. For a while, it made me a little angry.""
To combat anti-Asian sentiments, Ng said raising awareness of Asian culture is key.
""The more we do to engage other Asians in the community, and the more we share in culture and language,
is the only way we overcome these stereotypes and cultural barriers,"" she said.
Kevin Quan
The Lunar New Year was ""a special day"" for Quan when he was growing up in Jamaica, Queens.
That day started special with no school.
Instead, his parents would drive him and his siblings to Chinatown in Manhattan to visit their grandparents,
relatives and friends. By the end of the day, he would go home with dozens of money-filled red envelopes,
known as hongbao.
""It seemed that whole day, every single adult except your parents would give you something,"" he recalled
with a laugh. ""When you were a little child, you never had your own money. Receiving hongbao was exciting.
It didn't happen at any other time of the year. It didn't even happen during Christmas.""
Quan, 39, doesn't remember what he did with the money. What he does remember is taking the crisp bills
out of the envelopes, putting them in a pile and counting them before putting the money away in a shoebox
under his bed.
""As a child, I didn't have a job. I didn't get an allowance,"" Quan said. ""Back then, I felt like it was the most
money I ever had in the world.""
What else Quan remembers were the packed streets, crowded festivities and loud fireworks going off in
Chinatown at night.
""It felt like a day of fun,"" he said. ""It was special.""
Now a father of two, Quan said his family will downsize a typical 20-person inaugural New Year's meal at his
parents' Bayside house to a small one with his wife, daughters and mother-in-law at their New Hyde Park
home.
For the bigger family that includes his parents, siblings, nephews and nieces, Quan said the family will likely
get together on Zoom.

Manila, Feb. 26 -- Filipinos in the United States are advised to exercise ""utmost caution"" as the Philippine
Embassy in Washington, D.C. expressed concern over the rise in unprovoked attacks against Asian-Americans in
various parts of the US.
American news organizations have reported a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence in cities across the US,
particularly among older people.
One of the recently reported attacks involved a Filipino, whose face was disfigured after a man slashed his face
with a box cutter while inside a subway train in New York City.
""Filipinos are advised to exercise utmost caution in view of these incidents. Those who experience attacks are
advised to immediately call 911 to report incidents,"" the embassy said in a statement on Friday.
The embassy, nevertheless, thanked the swift action taken by a number of local authorities to apprehend
perpetrators of the attacks, labeled by many as ""hate crimes"".
However, it called on federal, state, and local authorities to further ensure the protection of persons of Asian
descent, including Filipinos.
A coalition called Stop AAPI Hate said it received a total of 2,808 reported incidents of racism and discrimination

Festivities for the Lunar New Year holiday, normally East Asia's busiest tourism season, are muted after China,
Vietnam, Taiwan and other governments tightened travel curbs and urged the public to avoid big gatherings
following renewed coronavirus outbreaks.
In China, Buddhist and Daoist temples that are usually packed with holiday worshippers are closed. Streets in
major cities were largely empty.
Ji Jianping, 62, was among those gathering outside the locked gates of the Tibetan-style Lama Temple on
Beijing's north side to burn incense and pray. She said she and her family skipped visiting their home town in
the northern province of Shanxi due to the pandemic.
The government's appeal to China's public to avoid travel is denting spending on tourism and gifts. But
economists say the overall impact might be limited if factories, shops and factories keep operating instead of
taking their usual two-week break.
The commerce ministry said 48 million more people in Chinese cities planned to celebrate where they lived
instead of travelling.
The China State Railway Group said railway journeys were down by almost 70 per cent from last year.
Departures from Beijing's two major airports were down 75 per cent.

202104,"
Christine Chiu hadn't expected a knock on the bedroom door on her wedding night. The visitor was her new mother-inlaw, whom after a whirlwind engagement she had met for only the first time that day. In her
hands was a ""gigantic"" book, and what was written inside was also unexpected: proof that her new husband, Dr Gabriel Chiu, a renowned Los Angeles-based plastic surgeon, was ""the 24th generation direct
descendant of the Song dynasty"".
The suggestion was that Gabriel, king of Beverly Hills' boobs and bottoms, would have been the sovereign of a vast Chinese empire had it not been overthrown in the 13th century. It came as a surprise to
Christine, who was born in Taiwan but grew up in California. She knew little about
ancient Chinese dynasties. Her mother-inlaw took her through hundreds of years of male emperors listed in the book, and their progeny. At the end was her husband's name, followed by an empty space. ""It is
very important that you do not let us down,"" she was told. The family wanted a male heir to continue the line.
Christine, then 24, and Gabriel, 15 years her senior, started trying for a baby emperor at their Bel Air home. But she couldn't get pregnant. They did rounds and rounds of IVF, with different techniques and
different doctors ? the best that money could buy. A decade passed and still there was no heir. ""I just saw that empty space I was supposed to fill,"" Christine says. ""That was my job, that is the one thing they
asked of me, that was my value."" At family gatherings she was made to sit at the children's table and wash the dishes, all the while harbouring the secret that it was actually her husband who
had fertility problems. She silently ""bore his shame"" for 11 years. Eventually, in 2018, she gave birth to Gabriel Christian Chiu III, or ""Baby G"" as they call him. He arrived chubby-cheeked, dressed in Versace and
ready to rule his imaginary kingdom.
Now 38, Christine is one of the stars and producers of Bling Empire, the latest Netflix docuseries to adopt the tried-and-tested formula of following the seemingly vacuous lives and eye-popping consumption of a
group of super-rich friends. The difference is that this show has an all-Asian cast. It's Crazy Rich Asians meets Keeping Up with the Kardashians ? solid gold trash but with layers of cultural intrigue; yes, it's about
cash, cars, clothes and plastic surgery, but it's also about the balance ? and tension ? between therapised, liberal life in LA and east Asian traditions and responsibilities.
""These are stories of infertility, surrogacy, parenthood ? difficult topics across any ethnicity, but set against the backdrop of very traditional eastern expectations there is an additional layer of complexity,"" says
Christine, speaking from her home office in Bel Air. She says she's dressed in Loro Piana cashmere ""sweats"", which cost about £1,800 each, but doesn't want to turn on her video. ""Nothing glamorous. I'm first a
mom, then a businesswoman, then a personality and producer,"" she says. ""On TV screens Asian faces and perspectives are underrepresented, so the show was an opportunity I couldn't pass up.""
Usually dripping in ""high jewellery"", she is presented as the self-made, ponytailswinging mean girl of the series, the couture queen of Beverly Hills, never shy of putting on an ostentatious show of wealth or
mentioning her (considerable) philanthropic pursuits ? and her acquaintance with the Prince of Wales.
Christine and her husband, who are worth a reported £80 million through their private clinic, Beverly Hills Plastic Surgery, are the main backers of the Prince's Foundation Health & Wellbeing Centre at Dumfries
House in East Ayrshire, Scotland, which uses complementary therapies to help locals with obesity, loneliness and depression. Two of its health lodges are named after none other than Baby G. The same Baby G
who, in one episode of Bling
Empire, is photographed for his preschool admission portrait, at the age of one, dressed in a tuxedo, sitting upright in a miniature sports car as $100 bills rain down.
Christine's nemesis in the show is Anna Shay, 60, a withering matriarch figure to the younger cast members. She's the eccentric daughter of the late arms dealer Edward Shay, whose company was sold by Anna
and her brother to Lockheed Martin for a reported $1.2 billion in cash in 2006.
Shay shops for diamonds as though they are sweets, throws dinner parties as though they are tests of allegiance and sounds lonely ? she met her best friend over the counter of her favourite jewellery house in
Paris. She trusts few people ? particularly not Christine, whom she appears to view as a name-dropping, nouveau riche pretender.
The two are set up as frozen-faced frenemies. In one episode Christine is moved to the wrong end of the dinner table for wearing a diamond necklace that Shay also owns. ""I mean, I was seated to the left of
Prince Charles at Buckingham Palace earlier this year,"" Christine complains. Shay is unfussed. ""I do find it odd that she wants to compete with me,"" she purrs. ""But she cannot compete with what I was born into.""
""There are certainly discussions on new money versus old money,"" Christine tells me when I ask about the characters' different attitudes towards wealth. ""I'm of a younger generation, so I am more open to
speaking about consumption. But I don't do it in a way of boasting. I know the show is edited in that way, unfortunately, because people are hooked by the bling and the glitz, but for me I look at luxury
consumption as an investment and a preservation of really important pieces of art."" She adds: ""I hate to say it, but I don't think there's older money than dynastic money.""
When pushed, Christine is unsure what proportion of her in-laws' wealth is ""dynastically related"", but she knows they do ""very, very well"" in property. Why, then, does the family place so much emphasis on its links
to the Song dynasty? Isn't it all a bit pretentious?
""I don't think anyone really cares about or traces dynasties and I try to downplay that,"" she says. ""But I also don't want to disrespect someone's heritage ? it's just being proud
of where they are from. To me and my husband and our everyday life it has no relevance. What is a big deal is that my husband is a good father, an excellent surgeon and a beautiful human being.""
Gabriel Chiu was born in Hong Kong and moved to the US as a child. He has a ""traditional"" family, very private and ""anything but boastful, you would never know they have so much money"", Christine says. The
couple met while working at a large medical corporation: he was a senior plastic surgeon, the ""star of the company"", and she was a vice-president of marketing.
""I thought there was a lot of untapped potential,"" she says. ""I was looking at him, thinking, this is a man who clearly cares about his craft and his work more than he cares about the profit, but I think in the right
setting we can really have it all. We can give patients the most elevated experience and he can be recognised for it.""
After their marriage in 2006 Christine decided to set up a plastic surgery practice, with herself as the managing director and Gabriel as lead surgeon. ""He was my first employee,"" she says. They launched their
clinic using funds from Gabriel's family as well as money of their own. ""For a long time his family called it his very expensive hobby. They were very much on board, no expense was spared. The truth is, we didn't
make a profit [at the beginning] but it didn't matter because every morning he woke up and he was excited, approaching every patient like it was his canvas. I mean, he had a bottomless account to tap into to
make it the very best it can be and, in the journey of doing that, things caught fire and we grew.""

Christine herself comes from a ""very financially comfortable background"". Her parents were successful in business, moving from Taiwan to California when she was five. She struggled at school, speaking
only Mandarin at first. ""There was a class that taught Hispanic kids how to speak English, so I joined that,"" she says. She had to learn Spanish in order to learn English. ""I was very much made fun of. I've had my
fair share of bullying. I went to three high schools and it wasn't easy.""
She says her parents wanted to keep her grounded, emphasising the importance of having a job. ""My husband and I grew up in
affluency, and both sides went out of their way to make sure we built a strong work ethic."" She had a trust fund, but was cut offfrom it because she ""didn't do exactly what my parents wanted me to do at some
point"". She is guarded on this and won't say exactly why. That's all ancient history, however, as today the Chius' clinic is ""enormously profitable"". With more than 35,000 patients it's the go-to place for celebrities
and the super-rich. She won't name names.
Covid, she says, has caused a ""Zoom boom"" in plastic surgery. The more people are looking at their faces on a screen, the more treatments they want. ""People are putting the money they would have spent on a
big vacation back into their body. Before, they would chip away at their bucket list of things to get done, but during Covid
people are just getting it all done at once because they can recover at home and hide.""
The clinic offers a ""mommy makeover"", which can include a breast lift, liposuction and tummy tuck. ""In many cases"", reads the website, ""women who have taken perfect care of their bodies feel trapped in their
sagging or stretched skin as their self-confidence diminishes.""
There is an argument, I suggest, that plastic surgeons reinforce people's insecurities rather than curing them. There is nothing more validating ? and crushing ? than someone in a white coat telling you that you
have bingo wings and a flat arse. ""There are a lot of surgeons who would just do it all ? take the money and just do it.
With Dr Chiu, he is definitely on the more natural side. He will talk people out of surgeries,"" she says.
I ask about her own list of regular treatments. ""Ironically I'm very needlephobic,"" she admits. Her husband had to hire an anaesthesiologist to sedate her just
so she could have Botox. Now, though, they have a machine called a Pro-Nox. ""It's nitrous oxide,"" she says ? laughing gas ? ""and I breathe into it, then he [Gabriel] puts in some Botox and filler.""
Instagram is her playground. On it she leads, by her own admission, a ""frivolous, materialistic"" lifestyle. As a child she was not allowed dolls, only books ? ""just black and white and ink for me"" ? because her
parents wanted her to focus on her studies. In traditional Asian culture, she says, when a woman gets married she leaves her old family and joins a new one. ""My late twenties were like a new chapter for me. It
was my chance to relive all these suppressed little girl fantasies I had. And I really went for it.""
She began bingeing on couture and today tries to buy one piece from every fashion show she attends ? sometimes costing six figures apiece. However, although she looked as if she were living the Californian
dream on Instagram, behind the scenes she was going through increasingly invasive IVF treatment, ""burning out"" her body.
""I can see how [my husband's parents] were looking at my life from the outside and thinking, this girl doesn't want to be a mom, she just wants to wear her designer clothing and travel."" The pressure was building
on her to have a son, with her in-laws blaming her body and health. ""In the eastern Asian culture you don't talk back [to elders]. It's just how it goes. So I would say, 'I'm sorry, I'm trying, I will do better, I
promise.' "" Didn't she mind carrying the can for her husband's infertility ? an issue that she says stemmed from ""a medical problem he had from when he was very young"" ? for 11 years? ""I really don't know what
my in-laws' response would have been if I'd said it wasn't me. I don't know if they would have accepted it. It's a very east Asian expectation for the wife to protect the husband and to protect the family. It was my
duty and my role. I wasn't OK with it, but I knew that's what I had to do.""
At one point the couple considered using a sperm donor and smuggling a biologically illegitimate heir past Gabriel's family. ""I remember looking at these photos of donors and thinking, could this pass off[as
Gabriel]? Then I remember thinking, they would DNA the baby, there's no way we could pull this off.""
Christine thought she was going to take the secret of her husband's fertility issues with her to the grave, until it ""blurted"" out of her mouth as the Bling Empire cameras were rolling. Her husband discusses it on
camera too. She says she is talking about it now in order to push against Asian expectations of privacy and, as a result, ease
the shame. Huge numbers of people have got in touch with her as a result.
""I didn't realise that so many Asian women were undergoing IVF ? whether it's because of male or female infertility.
We're in the same boat, feeling the pain and pressure from in-laws and parents."" She hasn't spoken to her own in-laws about whether they have seen the show. She's hoping they have not.
Now two and a half, Baby G is their ""miracle"" child and Christine is out of ""the doghouse"" with the Chiu family. Still, she wants to make sure that her son retains his Chinese and Taiwanese identity and the intimacy
with his grandparents' culture, while embracing the Californian values that resonate with her. ""I still feel confined by tougher eastern expectations. I don't think I get to enjoy the casual vulnerability of a typical
Californian. But I want Baby G to grow up knowing it's OK to be mad and struggle and talk about things openly.""
Naturally Baby G has a trust fund, but Christine says he must ""build his own
legacy and not measure success by money"". The naming of the two lodges at the Prince's Foundation Health & Wellbeing Centre in his honour was their seven-month birthday present to him. (""I have to say we
have been longtime supporters and fans of Prince Charles for his commitment and dedication to his people and his country,""
she gushes. ""He's just a really remarkable man, and so funny too! Really witty ? he has the best sense of humour."") For Baby G's first birthday, the couple made a $1 million donation in his name to the Cayton
Children's Museum in Santa Monica. It was announced at a birthday party that boasted circus performers, a ten-course meal and an arcade claw machine that picked out Gucci presents.
According to Christine, Baby G spoke sign language before he was a year old, and today is learning Mandarin, French and English. During the recent Covid lockdowns the Chius have converted a portion of their
guesthouse into a school and hired a tutor. Baby G is taught a broad curriculum that includes drawing, painting, global music, drumming, sound healing
and yoga. In the afternoons they tend to the vegetable patch in order to teach him about sustainability or hang out with the llamas, borrowed from a rescue programme after Baby G was ""naturally drawn to
them"".
Despite all this, Christine insists she is no ""tiger mom"". ""I don't think it was my parents' intention, but it was very much implied that I wasn't good enough,"" she says. ""My A was not good enough because I should
have gotten an A-plus. But I think it's the wrong type of push. My son should know he's good enough already.""
The show's grotesque excesses aside, Christine believes Bling Empire will have a positive impact on perceptions of east Asians in America, and on notions of beauty. ""People are considering [us] beautiful, when all
I wanted as a child was to be blonde and have blue eyes. It is very heartwarming."" But she is aware acceptance is fragile and racism is rife. In the past year President Trump repeatedly called Covid-19 the
""Chinese virus"", which many believe was the reason for a sharp increase in hate crimes against Asian-Americans.
Initially Chiu thought the wave of discrimination wouldn't affect her, living in culturally diverse Los Angeles. But one Sunday morning this year at a farmers' market two white men started yelling at Baby G. ""My
husband and I had masks and sunglasses on ? it was questionable whether or not we were Asian ? but Baby G only had a mask on. They were calling
him the 'China virus' and telling him to go home and take this virus with him. I was shocked that there was still that much hatred. It woke me up because I thought we were insulated, being in LA, but we're not.""
I tell her about a text a friend of mine sent me about Bling Empire before our interview: ""I am OBSESSED!!!!"" She is Chinese-British and the show struck a chord with her. ""It's such an amazing portrayal of what
it's like to be Asian (obviously not the financial side) but of the importance of family life,"" my friend wrote. ""I find it the most relatable programme I've ever watched, even though they are so different to me. It
really hit home with the things I've experienced. I know that for my mum, for example, the more westernised we got, the further we drifted from her. It's really hard.""
Chiu understands. Since the death of her mother last year she has started to reconnect with long-lost family members back in Taiwan. ""I am reviving some cultural aspects of my background that were muted,"" she
says, but then stops herself. ""We are diving into questions that will be explored in season two, if there is one,"" she explains. ""I don't want to give away too many spoilers."" A reminder, if ever one was needed, that
her life is now a soap opera, and it's clear we have come to the end of my allotted episode n
Bling Empire is on Netflix now
The Prince of Wales ""is just a really remarkable man, and so funny too! Really witty ? he has the best sense of humour"" ""People are considering us beautiful, when all I wanted as a child was to be blonde and have
blue eyes""

NASHVILLE, TN-Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thailand native who lived in San Francisco, died several
weeks ago after being shoved to the ground. Across the bay, another man injured three people in Oakland's
Chinatown neighborhood. According to CNN, the victims were a 91-year-old man, a 60-year-old man, and a 55-
year-old woman.
Last Tuesday in the Flushing neighborhood of New York City, a 52-year-old Chinese-American woman was
attacked outside a bakery. A man shoved her to the ground so hard she struck her head and passed out. The
same day, two Asian seniors were assaulted on the subway in separate incidents, according to NBC.
House Democrats last week denounced a spate of recent anti-Asian violence in California and New York. They
called for Congress and the White House to pass legislation to provide Department of Justice grants to states
and local governments to improve reporting of hate crimes.
They want to meet with the DOJ about enforcement and called for more support for victims. They said they
would hold hearings on the rise in racially motivated incidents.

The authorities in Alameda County, California, have created a special response unit focused on crimes against
Asians, particularly older Asians.
The move last Monday came after a string of violent assaults on Asian Americans, including one in Oakland,
California, in which a young man violently pushed a 91-year-old Asian man to the ground.
The video has sent a chill through the Asian American community. Two more Asian Americans, a 60-year-old
man and a 55-year-old woman, were also attacked that same day - Jan 31 - and had to be taken to hospital,
the San Francisco Chronicle reported.
A 28-year-old African American has been arrested. He is a suspect in all three cases.
The incidents came just days after Mr Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man, died after he was similarly
attacked while out on a morning walk in his San Francisco neighbourhood on Jan 28.
A 19-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder and elder abuse in that case.
At a press conference last Monday in Oakland's Chinatown, Alameda County district attorney Nancy O'Malley,
announcing the task force, said: ""The rapid increase in criminal acts targeted against members of the Asian
community, particularly Chinese Americans, who live and work in Alameda County is intolerable.""

Last week, the Committee of 100, an influential non-partisan group of prominent Chinese Americans in
business, government, academia and the arts, released a White Paper commissioned by the Economist
Intelligence Unit on the contributions of Chinese Americans to the United States.
The release was in response to increased anti-China sentiment in ""an age inflamed with resurgent racism, and
with geopolitical tension reversing decades of fruitful exchange with China"".
""The US has reached a moment when it is critical to examine how diversity has benefited the society and how
minority groups such as Chinese Americans have, over time, become identified with the country itself,"" the
report says.
Chinese Americans contributed more than US$300 billion ($373 billion) to US gross domestic product in 2019
through consumer spending, supporting three million jobs, the report says.
UNACCEPTABLE ACTS
“The rapid increase in criminal acts targeted against members of the Asian community, particularly Chinese
Americans, who live and work in Alameda County is intolerable.”
ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY NANCY O'MALLEY, announcing the task force.
""There are over 160,000 Chinese American-owned businesses in the US, generating approximately US$240
billion in revenue and supporting 1.3 million jobs as of 2017,"" it adds.
Last August , the United Nations special rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination,
xenophobia and related intolerance, in a note on the US, wrote: ""Racially motivated violence and other incidents
against Asian Americans have reached an alarming level across the US since the outbreak of Covid-19.""
It added: ""Chinese Americans and other Asian Americans, including those of Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese,
Filipino, and Burmese descent, among others, have been subject to racist, xenophobic attacks.""
It said the attacks included being spat on, blocked from public transport and beaten.
The Jan 6 storming of the US Capitol demonstrated the danger of anti-Chinese sentiment amplified to deafening
levels by right-wing media.
Take, for example, Larry R. Brock, a retired US Air Force lieutenant-colonel photographed carrying zip-tie
handcuffs on the Senate floor during the insurrection by hundreds of Trump supporters.
A week before, he wrote on Facebook that he saw no distinction among the Democrats, the Biden administration
and ""an invading force of Chinese communists"".
On Jan 27, President Joe Biden signed an executive action directing federal agencies to combat xenophobia.
""Today, I'm directing federal agencies to combat the resurgence of xenophobia, particularly against Asian
Americans and Pacific Islanders, that we've seen skyrocket during this pandemic. This is unacceptable and it's
un-American,"" the President said.
The Committee of 100 welcomed the statement, but feels more is needed, hence the White Paper.
Committee of 100 president Zhengyu Huang, who is based in San Francisco, told The Sunday Times: ""Last year,
we saw almost 3,000 documented cases of anti-Chinese and anti-Asian incidents.
""We knew we had to speak up forcefully, because racism and discrimination are unfortunate, negative aspects of
society.

202104,"
SAN FRANCISCO—Political leaders in the San Francisco Bay Area are forming task forces and speaking out against anti-Asian violence after a spate of recent incidents that include
two assaults against elderly men that were captured on video.
In Oakland, Calif., police on Feb. 5 arrested a man suspected in a string of assaults in that city's Chinatown, including allegedly pushing a 91-year-old man to the ground.
Yahya Muslim, 28, was arraigned on Tuesday and is due to return for a plea hearing on March 2 in Alameda County Superior Court. Brendon Woods, the county public defender whose
office is representing the suspect, said Mr. Muslim has a history of mental illness and substance abuse and there is no evidence of bias against Asian-Americans in the case.
The assaults spurred Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley to create a special response unit that she said would include members who speak Cantonese and Mandarin
that will aim to build trust and engagement with crime victims.
""Since the onset of Covid-19 we have seen an uptick in crime against Asian Americans,"" Ms. O'Malley said.
In San Francisco, video of a Jan. 28 attack on Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old man originally from Thailand, has spurred fear among elderly Asian-Americans in the city, local
activists said. Mr. Ratanapakdee was on a morning walk in a residential enclave when he was knocked to the ground by a man who ran into him. Mr. Ratanapakdee died two days later
at a local hospital.
The authorities have charged Antoine Watson, 19, with murder and elder abuse.
Sliman Nawabi, a public defender representing Mr. Watson, said his client didn't intend to kill Mr. Ratanapakdee and likely wasn't aware of the man's race or age. Mr. Watson pleaded
not guilty to the charges.
""I know it's gotten a lot of attention…because there's been other incidents in the Bay Area, and nationally, targeting Asian-Americans,"" Mr. Nawabi said. ""But this case here is not
motivated by Mr. Ratanapakdee's race or his age.""
According to the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, attacks on people of Asian descent in the U.S. have been on the rise since
the start of the pandemic last year. In March and April, there were more anti-Asian hate crimes in various cities than the previous totals for the full year of 2019, said Brian Levin, a
professor of criminal justice and director of the center.
New York City had a record year of hate crimes against Asians in 2020, according to preliminary data, while in Los Angeles and San Jose, such crimes more than doubled from 2019,
according to preliminary data analyzed by Dr. Levin. The attacks range from people being spat on to assaults.
The New York Police Department formed this past fall an Asian Hate Crime Task Force , its first-ever task force dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.

""End the violence toward Asians,"" said the promotional fliers. ""Let's unite against white nationalism.""
Demonstrators gathered in New York on Saturday in the wake of a spate of unprovoked violent attacks on Asian-Americans. Earlier this month, Noel Quintana, a 61-year-old native of
Manila, was slashed in the face with a box cutter while commuting to work on a crowded subway car. He survived but required about 100 stitches to close his wounds. Other victims have
been less fortunate.
In Milwaukee last September, a 36-year-old Hmong American named Ee Lee was sexually assaulted in a city park and died at a hospital from ""blunt force trauma to her head."" The
suspects fled on bicycles.
In San Francisco last month, Vicha Ratanapakdee, 84 and originally from Thailand, was on his regular morning walk when a passerby knocked him to the ground and ran away.
Ratanapakdee died from his injuries a few days later. Across the Bay, in Oakland's Chinatown, police have documented an uptick in assaults, particularly on the elderly. On Jan. 31, a man
was caught on camera in separate incidents approaching a 91-year-old man and 55-year-old woman from behind and shoving them to the pavement. The woman lost consciousness.
""It's not unique to Chinatown or to the Asian community, the increase in crime we've seen across the city and across the county,"" said the district attorney for Alameda County, which
includes Oakland, at a news conference earlier this month. ""But we have seen in the last several weeks and month a very specific increase in crimes committed against Asians.""
Some have attributed these attacks to the previous administration's coronavirus rhetoric, while others see them as part of a broader increase in crime rates during the pandemic. Maybe
it's both. What's harder to demonstrate is that these attacks stem from a rise in ""white nationalism,"" as that New York flier claims. Despite efforts to shoehorn such incidents into the left's
favorite political narrative, all the suspects in the attacks described above are black. There have been white-supremacist attacks on Asians, such as the 2012 shooting at a Sikh temple in
Wisconsin, which killed six. But are white nationalists responsible for blacks committing crimes against Asians?
Liberals continue to pretend that racism and prejudice are one-way streets—that only whites can be perpetrators, while blacks can only be victims. But criminals and victims come in all
colors. Surveillance cameras have caught young black men playing the so-called knockout game, which involves sucker-punching random white pedestrians for amusement. And federal
data have long shown that while in most cases the victim and perpetrator of a violent crime are of the same race, black-on-white violent-crime rates far exceed the reverse scenario.
Liberals skirt these plain truths out of a belief that it helps them politically, and perhaps it does. Racial paranoia helps civil-rights activists raise money, and it helps Democrats get elected
by scaring black voters to the polls. But it also comes with a downside for blacks: It undermines trust in American institutions and society.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Feb. 16, blacks were only 6% of Covid-19 vaccine recipients, even though they are 13% of the U.S. population. ""Across
the 34 states reporting data on vaccinations by race/ethnicity, there is a largely consistent pattern of Black and Hispanic people receiving smaller shares of vaccinations compared to their
shares of cases and deaths and compared to their shares of the total population,"" explains an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Some point to a general and longstanding lack of trust in government among many blacks. Often invoked is the infamous Tuskegee experiment begun in the 1930s, in which black men
were promised but never given treatment for syphilis. But my creeping suspicion is that something more sinister has taken place.
In recent years, and at a much louder volume than before, black Americans have been encouraged by liberal elites to hate their country and to distrust others based on race and ethnicity.
This is the message that undergirds everything from the New York Times's ""1619 Project"" to workplace ""diversity"" training and critical race theory. Now it's working to undermine public
health. Blacks aren't going to fight the virus any differently than other groups. We're in this together, and the newfangled racial separatism that now operates under the guise of wokeness
does no one any good, especially black Americans.

New York City is increasing police patrols and investigations to fight a rise in hate crimes targeting Asian people amid the coronavirus pandemic, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Tuesday.
Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, said at a briefing that police would step up investigations and patrols of subway stations. There were 28 coronavirus-related hate crimes committed against Asian
people in New York City in 2020, compared with three such hate crimes in 2019, according to New York Police Department figures.
There have been two hate crimes against Asian residents in New York City so far this year, according to the NYPD, up from zero of such crimes during the same period last year.
The most recent incident occurred on Feb. 15, according to police officials, when an unknown assailant allegedly used hate speech against an Asian man in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood
before punching him and stealing his phone.
Video of a Feb. 16 attack on an older Asian woman in the Flushing section of Queens went viral on social media, prompting actress Olivia Munn to share the incident on Twitter, leading to an
arrest, according to NYPD officials.
Rise in Hate Crimes
* Violence Against Asian-Americans Raises Concern in Bay Area (Feb .12)
That incident, which hasn't been determined to be a hate crime by police, was widely cited by politicians and community leaders who have called on the city to step up its efforts to protect Asian
residents.
Mr. de Blasio said Tuesday the rise in hate crimes against Asian residents was driven by biases held by individuals who blame Chinese and other Asian people for Covid-19.
""From the very beginning, even before we had a single case in New York City, Asian American communities were suffering discrimination. Asian-American businesses saw their customers no
longer come,"" Mr. de Blasio said. ""It's been a very tough time for Asian communities.""
Mr. de Blasio said the NYPD's Asian Hate Crime Task Force would be ramping up investigations in response to the rise in hate crimes. Formed in October, the task force is the first-ever group
within the NYPD dedicated to investigating crimes targeting a single race.
Additionally, Mr. de Blasio said members of his Office for the Prevention of Hate Crimes would be meeting with community leaders this week to discuss additional measures city officials can take
to address the issue.
NYPD Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, who is commanding officer of the Asian Hate Crime Task Force, said at Tuesday's briefing that the group comprised 25 detectives of Asian backgrounds who
speak 11 Asian languages. The group's familiarity with the city's Asian communities is key to effective investigation, Mr. Loo said.
""We are here to guarantee there's a strong appropriate response to the hate that's infecting our city,"" said Mr. Loo. ""The task force consists of members that come from the community to serve
the community.""
Mr. Loo said that police have made arrests in 18 of the 28 hate crimes that occurred against Asian residents in 2020 and one arrest in the two cases that have occurred so far this year. Mr. Loo
said the character of the crimes that were committed varied, but in each case the perpetrator made a statement regarding the coronavirus or indicating bias against Asians.

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
United Airlines Pays
To Settle Mail Case
United Airlines Holdings Inc. agreed to pay more than $49 million to settle criminal charges and civil claims
related to the transportation of international mail, the Justice Department said Friday.
United was accused of submitting false delivery-scan data between 2012 and 2015 to make it appear that the
airline and its partners had transported mail in a timely manner to the intended recipient, the Justice
Department said. Under the agreements, United was entitled to full payment when scans were provided and the
mail was timely delivered, the agency said.
The Justice Department said United admitted to concealing problems related to scanning and mail movements
that, if known, would have subjected the carrier to financial penalties under the international contracts.
United said it was ""glad to have remedied these procedures"" and called the U.S. Postal Service a valued
customer.
United agreed to pay about $17.3 million in criminal penalties and $32.2 million under a false claims settlement,

NEW YORK
Schools Chancellor
Will Leave Post
New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza will leave his post in March as education officials work to
reopen some public schools that have remained closed for most of the past year because of the Covid-19
pandemic.
Meisha Porter, a longtime city Education Department official and the executive superintendent of Bronx schools,
will succeed Mr. Carranza, Mayor Bill de Blasio's office said Friday. Ms. Porter, 47 years old, will be the first Black
woman to serve in the role. She will succeed Mr. Carranza on March 15, city officials said.
Mr. Carranza said that he was proud of what he has accomplished in his time serving as the chief of the nation's
largest school district.
""While the work is never done, we have created a lot of important change together,"" he said.
He added that in the past year he has lost 11 family members and close friends and needed time to grieve.
Mr. Carranza tried to debunk speculation that his departure stemmed from tensions between the chancellor and
the mayor over decisions about reopening and policies on admission to selective programs.
He said he appreciated that the mayor ""has allowed all of us at the table to have differing views and to argue
those views and to advocate those views and come to a consensus.""
Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat, leaves office on Dec. 31 because of term limits.

Hate Crime Alleged
in Man's Stabbing
A Brooklyn man was charged with attempted murder as a hate crime after allegedly stabbing an Asian-American
man in the back in an unprovoked attack in Manhattan's Chinatown, New York Police Department officials said
Friday.
The suspect, Salman Muflihi, allegedly approached a 36-year-old man from behind on Thursday and stabbed
him, police officials say. The victim, who wasn't identified by police, was listed in stable condition at Bellevue
hospital Friday. Mr. Muflihi may have been suffering from psychological distress at the time of the attack,
according to the officials.

A University of Arizona research team documented 34 Asian students' experiences facing discrimination during
the pandemic last year, and it wants to hear from more UA Asian students.
Five interdisciplinary UA doctoral students with diverse Asian backgrounds — Kiera Midori Coulter, Jared Joshua
Anucha Barnett, Raynimol Thomas, Sei Eun Kim and Zhenqiang Zhao — noticed the national trend of Asian
discrimination and hate crimes on the news and social media last summer. Some of them had faced
discrimination as well.
""We started to talk about what we, as social scientists, can do something for our community?"" one of the
researchers, Zhenqiang Zhao, told The Arizona Republic.
Having known each other for a long time, the five students decided to do a research project on the issue.
The purpose of the project was to learn about the experiences of Asian students, specifically East and Southeast
Asian students, at UA during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the project's consent form.
Some harassment stems from the origins of the 2019 new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, first identified
that year in Wuhan, China.
This study sought to understand how Asian students perceived and experienced anti-Asian discrimination related

to COVID-19, the potential impacts of anti-Asian discrimination on ethnic identity, and how anti-Asian
discrimination related to activism, the form said.
Student: 'He said scum bucket China boy here to take our
checks and then spat on me'
After collecting data in October and November 2020, the team presented its preliminary analysis in an online
meeting hosted by the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth, and Families on March 4.
The FMI serves as a catalyst for cross-disciplinary research on children, youth and families at the University of
Arizona, according to the institute's Facebook page.
In its preliminary analysis, the team identified three types of anti-Asian discrimination that Asian students
experienced due to the pandemic: vicarious (indirect) discrimination, overt (direct) discrimination and
ambiguous discrimination, Zhao said.
In the presentation, the team provided quotes from the student participants about their experiences.
One participant said he had a couple of experiences when going to the lab, according to the presentation.
""So I have to take the public transportation and when I go pass along the bus stops. Some, some guy. I did not
look at him. He said scum bucket China boy here to take our checks and then spat on me and I'm like okay and
I just kept walking,"" the participant said, according to the presentation.
The student participants were not identified by the research team or by The Republic because they have been
targets of harassment.
""They use some profanity and they're like all the Chinese are here to kill us,"" another participant said.
The team also found physical aversions against Asian people.
A freshman at the University of Arizona experienced physical aversions when the person was in high school,
lived in Chandler, and worked in the drive-thru at a fast-food chain restaurant, according to the presentation.
""I had a customer not want to be served by me,"" the freshman said, according to the presentation. ""They want
to be served by someone else when they came to the window.""
The worker told their manager who took care of the situation by telling the customer they couldn't serve them
anymore, according to the presentation.
The team defined indirect discrimination as hearing about or seeing another person's experiences of racism via
the news media or social media, or an experience reported by family members or friends that may or may not
be witnessed by the participants, Zhao explained in the presentation.
""I have a friend who worked at a cafe and she also had a similar experience where a customer came up to her
and asked her if she was from China and my friend said yes. And he started saying, you know, you know, go
back to China and things like that. Basically blaming her for the pandemic,"" another participant said.
Another participant said they were asked ""where are you from"" more often than before the pandemic. ""But I feel
a little uncomfortable because it seems they, the person, asked me vaguely if you brought a virus from China,""
the participant said.
The team learned that Asian and Asian American students are aware of the hostile and discriminatory social

contexts that have made them more cautious in their daily lives, Sei Eun Kim explained in the presentation.
Given that the study took place in Phoenix and Tucson, the research team highlighted the need for research
from Asian and Asian Americans in rural areas during these times, Kim said.
Support sought for Asian students during the in-person fall semester
The University of Arizona announced on March 9 its plans to return to majority in-person learning for the fall
semester.
Hopefully, the team members have their perspectives, voices and thoughts organized and unified at the UA,
""so that in the transition to the fall semester, Asian Americans and Asian students will feel that they have
resources and support, and that there are followers who are doing this research that can actually boost their
confidence and their sense of unity and comfort,"" Kim said.
Zhao said he hopes the college and its departments can be ready for these kinds of issues for Asian people in
the fall semester.
""Our ultimate goal or final goal is that we really want Asian Americans' and other Asian students' voices to be
heard by society or by the campus, by the college,"" Zhao said. ""And we can get the support from the
department, from the school, and from each other.""
UA Asian students (both international and domestic students) who have lived in the U.S. during the pandemic
and are willing to participate in the research can visit http://tiny.cc/asianvoice to complete the survey. Eligible
candidates will be contacted by the research team.
Universities say no
documented anti-Asian
incidents since March 2020
Police departments for Arizona State University, Northern Arizona University and University of Arizona told
The Republic that they did not have documented anti-Asian incidents or hate crimes since the start of the
pandemic in March 2020.
""I have not heard of any anti-Asian discrimination at U of A since the pandemic started,"" Sgt. Sean Shields, of
the University of Arizona Police Department, told The Republic.
The Phoenix Police Department and Maricopa County Sheriff's Office did not respond to The Republic's inquiry
about anti-Asian incidents since March 2020.
The FBI said it will use all authority granted to it by federal law to investigate and hold those who commit
violent acts accountable for their actions, FBI spokesperson Jill McCabe said.
""We want to remind everyone that any violent criminal act against any person because of their race, ethnicity
or national origin is a hate crime. This includes violence toward Asian Americans or individuals from East
Asian countries,"" McCabe said in an email to The Republic.

Screen shot from surveillance videoPolice in Seattle Thursday arrested a 41-year-old man accused of swinging a
hard object wrapped in a sock into the heads of two people.
“I truly believe he was trying to kill us,” said Michael Poffenbarger, about him and his girlfriend to KOMO News.
“He hit her so hard (and) he hit me really really hard. I was amazed at how hard he hit my head and it didn’t
knock me out,” said Poffenbarger. “I thought for sure, I had a skull fracture.”
The State identified the other victim as high school teacher Noriko Nasu who suffered fractures to her face and
teeth.
The superintendent of the Northshore School District where Nasu works fears the attack may be racially
motivated.
“I am writing today to share my concerns regarding the current trend in increasing violence directed at Asian
community members both in our state and across our country,” Reid wrote in a blog post, according to The
State. “A member of our own Northshore staff family, Sensei Noriko Nasu, was brutally attacked while walking
with her partner in Seattle … The police are currently investigating the attack to determine whether it was a
hate crime or a random attack, this assault should never have happened.”
Police identified the suspect as Sean Holdip. The Conan Daily reports he is from Brooklyn, but previously lived in

New York mayoral candidate Andrew Yang unveiled a three-step plan to seriously address anti-Asian hate on
Friday.
Yang announced his plan after visiting with workers at Xi’an Famous Foods in Chinatown, where he says
numerous workers have been victims of hate crimes.
Yang’s plan calls for fully funding the city’s Asian Hate Crime Task force, which is now made up of 25 officers
who volunteer to be on the Task Force.
“It should not be a volunteer force,” Yang told reporters outside Xi’an Famous Foods. “I would treat it as hate
crimes which in my mind should be treated as hate crimes. There were a number of incidents early in the
pandemic which were not treated as that.”
He also vowed to reach out to communities that don’t have a positive relationship with the city officials and law
enforcement in the hopes of encouraging residents to report hate crimes which he says are severely
underreported.
“One employee told me the heartbreaking story about how he was assaulted,” said Yang. “The person followed
him out of the subway and punched him in the face after he got to the street level. He was injured and bruised
on his jaw. He was afraid to come to work for several days and then, even afterwards now, he’s afraid to ride
the subway.”

Police in the Bay Area city of Mountain View near San Jose arrested a Bay Area woman Friday in connection with
two anti-Asian hate crimes, reports CBS5.
Authorities say Karen Inman told employees at a local store last month that she didn’t have to pay for food and
clothing because they were Asian.
Police believe she’s the same woman who in February screamed racial slurs and spit at two customers at a
downtown restaurant, including an Asian one.
Neither victim desired to prosecute so police released Inman after detaining her, according to the San Francisco
Chronicle.
However, prosecutors continued to investigate and eventually issued an arrest warrant for Inman on hate crime
charges.
On Friday, NBC Bay Area reports police arrested her on accusations of stealing candy and ice cream from a
Smart & Final in Mountain View that same day.
“This case is both disheartening and disturbing. Mountain View is a vibrant community in many ways thanks to
the diversity that exists here,” said Mountain View Police Chief Chris Hsiung.

Photo by Nancy Hung. Asian Americans have become increasingly concerned with crimes against the elderly
during the pandemic. This photo was taken at an anti-Asian hate rally in New York earlier this month.
Police in Oakland announced an arrest Tuesday in the brutal beating of a 75-year-old Asian man left brain dead,
Fox2 reported.
An assailant attacked a 75-year-old Asian man going for his daily morning stroll near Lake Merritt in Oakland,
across from San Francisco , CBS5 first reported
“That’s the guy that stays up the street, that walks every morning and every evening down the street bothering
nobody,” said neighbor Florence Williams who recognized the victim to Fox2.
“He’s elderly and he’s fragile,” said Elizabeth Seymour of Oakland. “You can see it.”
Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce President Carl Chan says he reached out to those close to the
victim’s family and says the man is brain dead.
“When I heard about this…it’s just so hurtful. I know people are saying that they’re angry. I’m not angry. I’m so
sad.”

By Lisa K SonThe recent attacks on Asian Americans are disturbing, but nothing new. Even before the
pandemic, Asian Americans were routinely assaulted, spat upon, and told to “go back home,” but seldom chose
to report these incidents. The pandemic has simply made visible what had been largely invisible, though
skepticism remains as to whether these truly qualify as racially motivated attacks.
If we in the Asian community want to reduce our exposure to hate crimes, we must overcome our tendency to
remain silent. We must let the world know what we were experiencing long before COVID-19 began making
headlines.
As a researcher who studies the self-reflective process of metacognition and someone of Asian descent, it’s clear
to me that underreporting of racially motivated attacks on Asian Americans happens, at least in part, because
the victims are caught between American individualism and Asian collectivism. Too often, the Asian self prevails
and the victim fails to report the crime for the “good” of the group.
Metacognition, which develops in childhood, refers to our ability to understand and reflect on our own thought
processes. It has also been identified as a form of “privileged access,” where my own thoughts are private,
known only to me. Asian Americans tend to embrace this privacy. But why? For many immigrants, assimilation
is a life-long goal. Given differences in our appearances, habits, and speech, our strategy for successful
assimilation has been anonymity. We even refuse to let our facial expressions betray our emotions. A high
school teacher once announced that my nickname would be “poker face.” At the time, this didn’t feel like an

Story from Ethnic Media ServicesBy SUNITA SOHRABJI/EMS Contributing Editor
On Feb. 25 evening, a man scaled the wall of the 117-year-old Higashi Honganji Buddist Temple temple in Los
Angeles County’s ‘Little Tokyo’ neighborhood and set fire to two wooden lanterns at the entrance to the temple,
then knocked two metal lanterns off their stands, and finally threw a rock that shattered a plate glass window,
as documented in surveillance camera footage.
No one was hurt, said Bishop Noriaki Ito, who serves as the temple’s head priest. Speaking at the “LA vs. Hate –
Stop AAPI Hate Press Conference” press briefing March 8 morning, Ito said he does not yet know whether the
incident will be investigated as a hate crime.
“Our immediate response was anger and hurt. But then we leaned on our Buddhist teachings to find
compassion,” said the bishop, adding: “We are working to create a community of friends.”
The vandalism at the temple is the most recent of a string of anti Asian American incidents which have been
sweeping the country over the past year. The web portal Stop AAPI Hate, an initiative of the Asian Pacific Policy
and Planning Council, has logged 250 incidents in Los Angeles County over the past 12 months.
Nationwide, over 2,800 hate incidents — including violent attacks against elderly Asian Americans — have been
reported on the Stop AAPI Hate portal. Advocates at the briefing said that number represented an under-count:

most anti-Asian hate incidents go unreported.
On March 9, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors voted on a motion to expand the LA vs Hate initiative
and the Rapid Response Network, both of which support victims of hate crimes and incidents with support and
resources, including mental health counseling. The County has established the 211 hotline, which allows victims
to immediately call for help. The motion is sponsored by LA County Supervisor Hilda Solis.
“The situation has got worse over the past year. The person with the loudest bullhorn has mocked our
community,” said Solis at the March 8 press conference, adding that the 211 hotline has reported more than
800 hate incidents in LA County. “The vast majority of hate crimes go unreported,” she said.
LA County Supervisor Holly Mitchell, who also attended the press conference, said: “Just like COVID, hate has
spread rapidly. It’s disheartening to see women, children, the elderly, and even health care workers who have
put themselves on the front lines for us, are being targeted.”
Shelly Shen, a long-time resident of West Covina, California — the bucolic burb which served as the backdrop
for Rachel Bloom’s comedy series “Crazy Ex Girlfriend” — said she lived in a “wonderful community” that had
nonetheless experienced hate. Over the past year, one nearby family has kept up a persistent attack on her
family and her neighbors.
Shen was bitten by the family’s dog, when out on a walk with her dog; the racist family set up a fight between
the two dogs, she said. “They told me they were going to eat my dog,” said Shen, who still suffers scars from
the dog bites.
Law enforcement were not supportive, until Shen got LA vs. Hate involved. “They brought us law enforcement
help and emotional support,” said Shen. “We no longer felt like we were alone.”
“Don’t think this problem will go away if we ignore it: it won’t. Only together will we come out of this dark time,”
said Shen.
Law enforcement was also unresponsive for Hong Lee, a young resident of Los Angeles. Lee had gone into a
restaurant to pick up food. A man approached her, handed her a card, and invited her to lunch. When she
declined, noting that she was married, the man started up a seemingly unending volley of verbal, racist abuse.
The staff at the restaurant would not help. Lee phoned 911. Police officers arriving at the scene cited the lack of
a crime and did not take a police report. “There was a lack of empathy and compassion,” said Lee, adding later
that she continues to suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder and was afraid to leave her house for several
months.
Lee shared a video of the incident on her social media pages: five other women, who had faced the same abuse
by the same man, came forward. The LAPD subsequently apologized to Lee and took her report.
Lee advised people to take a video, if possible, and to attempt to de-escalate the situation. She asked people
who witness a hate crime to speak to the offender, and also to provide emotional support. “People have had
acid thrown at them; faces have been slashed,” she stated emotionally.
Other speakers at the press conference were: Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón; Robin S.
Toma, Executive Director of the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations, and Assistant Director of
the Los Angeles County department of Workforce Development, Aging and Community Services; Manjusha
Kulkarni, Executive Director, Asian Pacific Policy and Planning Council, and representative of StopAAPIHate; and
Fredrick Sykes, former Sheriff’s deputy, Mayor and City Councilmember of West Covina and currently a
commissioner of the LACCHR.

An 83-year-old Asian woman was punched in the nose and spat at on the sidewalk in White Plains, New York
Tuesday night, ABC 7 New York reports.
Nancy Toh was standing outside Westchester Mall in White plains around 7:30 p.m. when a man approached her.
Toh says that the man cocked his head back, spat at her and punched her in the nose, according to The New
York Post.The punch knocked Toh to the ground. She hit her head and fell unconsciouss.
When she came to, Toh told ABC 7 New York a good Samaritan was tending to her. She was covered in blood.
“Bleeding lots from the brain. Looks like pumping out,” Toh said.
Toh’s daughter Linda Toh said the attack has made her more afraid.
“I didn’t think it was so close to home,” Linda Toh told ABC 7 New York. “And now I’m afraid to go out and my
kid is afraid to go out.”
The suspect is an unhoused man who, according to police, has a violent history. White Plains Police say they’re

A 75-year-old Asian man has died after succumbing to injuries sustained from a robbery. The suspect is now
facing special circumstance murder charges.
On Thursday, Alameda County DA Nancy O’Malley filed special circumstances murder and multiple serious felony
charges against Teaunte Bailey, 26, in connection with crimes committed on two different dates in Oakland, CA,
according to a press release.
Bailey allegedly pushed 75-year-old Pak Ho to the ground and robbed him on the morning of March 9 in the
Adams Point neighborhood of Oakland. He fled in his car and was eventually apprehended.
Ho’s head hit the pavement after Bailey shoved him, causing him to sustain a traumatic head injury and brain
damage. He died of his injuries on Thursday.
Bailey is also being charged in connection with a similar crime that occurred February 19 2021. That day he
allegedly broke into a senior living apartment and shoved the 72-year-old victim inside. Police say he stole the
victim’s phone and several other items.
Bailey is being held at Santa Rita jail without bail, according to ABC 7. He is set to be arraigned on Friday, March
12.

Phoenix Police DepartmentThe family of a Filipino American man killed in Phoenix after being struck in the face
is a victim of an anti-Asian hate crime, reports People.
Police say 41-year-old Marcus Williams punched 71-year-old Juanito Falcon in the face for “no apparent reason.”
Falcon fell to the ground, suffered head injuries and died two days later in the hospital on February 18.
Authorities arrested Williams March 4.
Speaking out for the first time, the family of Falcon says they are still struggling to make sense of it all.
“It’s my dad who was helpless and who was not able to defend himself. It’s so devastating to think,” said
Falcon’s daughter, Malou Acunin to Fox10 News.
“Being Asian that he is, I believe he was specifically targeted,” said Lysander Lanuza to KCRG TV.
Phoenix Police, however, say the motive remains unclear and that it has no evidence the attack was racially
motivated.
“You took a very special person away from us, and he had so many more years to give and so much more love,”

In the late afternoon hours of Tuesday, March 16, police say 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long began a mass-
shooting spree on his first of three Asian massage parlors in Georgia, according to state authorities. The man
allegedly would go on to kill 8 and wound dozens in what has been described by many as a domestic terrorist
attack and hate crime. Long, according to Sheriffs, told authorities that a ‘sex addiction’ was the reason for his
attack.
Long, who was apprehended in South Georgia, is believed by law enforcement to be responsible for all three spa
shootings that took place in the state. Authorities quickly announced that there was no immediate motive and
urged the public not to jump to immediate conclusions, however, various facts began to slowly trickle out
leading activists and many concerned citizens alike to declare the shooting a hate crime.
One user on Twitter wrote of Long “He was taken into custody alive. Because he’s White. Remember that. He
didn’t get shot, he didn’t get beaten. He got taken into custody alive. Because he’s White.” The author brought
up the concept of White privilege in police interactions, citing conversations surrounding mass shooters Dylann
Roof and Nikolas Cruz.
Users also pointed to former president Donald Trump’s referral to the COVID-19 pandemic as possible inspiration
for the shooting. The then-president used the term “China Virus” over 20 times publicly in just 14 days and
continues to double-down on the statement, having again uttered the term at CPAC 2021.

Filipinos in the United States are advised to exercise utmost caution as the Philippine Embassy in Washington,
D.C. expressed concern over the rise in unprovoked attacks against Asian-Americans in various parts of the US.
American news organizations have reported a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence in cities across the US,
particularly among older people.
One of the recently reported attacks involved a Filipino, whose face was disfigured after a man slashed his face
with a box cutter while inside a subway train in New York City.
Filipinos are advised to exercise utmost caution in view of these incidents. Those who experience attacks are
advised to immediately call 911 to report incidents, the embassy said in a statement on Friday.
The embassy, nevertheless, thanked the swift action taken by a number of local authorities to apprehend
perpetrators of the attacks, labeled by many as hate crimes.
However, it called on federal, state, and local authorities to further ensure the protection of persons of Asian
descent, including Filipinos.
A coalition called Stop AAPI Hate said it received a total of 2,808 reported incidents of racism and discrimination

202104,"
Hate-fueled attacks on Asian Americans spiked across major U.S. cities last year - in some cases by triple-digit
percentages - even as overall hate crimes declined, newly analyzed police department statistics show.
Moreover, the alarming trend has continued into this year, experts say.
There were 122 incidents of anti-Asian American hate crimes in 16 of the country's most populous cities in 2020,
an increase of almost 150% over the previous year, according to data compiled by California State University's
Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism and exclusively shared with VOA. VOA independently collected data
for two of the cities.
Asian American rights advocates attribute the unprecedented string of attacks to former U.S. President Donald
Trump's rhetoric blaming China for the deadly coronavirus and, more broadly, the scapegoating of Asian
Americans by ordinary people frustrated or angered by the economic and social impact of the pandemic.
I think the political leadership under Trump really put a target on the backs of people perceived to be Chinese.
It's Sinophobia, said Chris Kwok, a board member for the Asian American Bar Association of New York.
Four other American cities also reported triple-digit percentage increases in anti-Asian hate crimes: Philadelphia
and Cleveland each reported six incidents, up from two in 2019; San Jose had 10, up from 4, while Los Angeles

reported 15, up from seven.
While most cities experienced overall hate crime declines, including attacks against groups that had recently
spiked like Jews, attacks against Asians rose materially in most cities, and only declined in one - Washington,
D.C., said Brian Levin, executive director of the hate and extremism research center.
The FBI defines a hate crime as a criminal offense motivated by race, religion, sexual orientation and other
factors. Examples include assault and vandalism. Each November, the FBI publishes its annual hate crime data for
the previous year. That means the data released by a handful of police agencies provides the only early window
into the number of hate crimes last year.
Though based on a relatively small sampling of data, the figures strongly suggest that 2020 will be the worst
year this century for anti-Asian hate crime, Levin said.
The reported spike in anti-Asian hate crimes is in line with data tracked by Asian American advocacy
organizations.
Stop AAPI Hate, a hate tracker created last year by several Asian American groups, has recorded more than
2,800 incidents of racism and discrimination targeting Asian Americans between March and December 2020.
While verbal harassment and shunning made up more than 90% of the incidents, physical assaults accounted for
nearly 9%.
Many of the victims are non-Chinese Asians who apparently were mistaken for having hailed from China.
East Asians who look Chinese are now experiencing this, and this goes back to a long history of anti-Asian
discrimination in this country, Kwok said of the United States.
In a troubling report released last month, Stop AAPI Hate said 126 of the incidents involved Asian Americans over
the age of 60. A number of incidents took place in the San Francisco Bay area last month, including one involving
a 91-year-old Asian man violently pushed to the ground by a stranger.
These violent assaults have a devastating impact on our community as they are part of an alarming rise in anti-
Asian American hate during the COVID-19 pandemic, co-founders of STOP AAPI Hate said in a February 9
statement.
In the latest incident, Salman Muflihi, 23, was arrested last week for allegedly stabbing a 36-year-old Asian man
on a street in New York City's Chinatown. Muflihi was charged over the weekend with one count of attempted
murder in addition to other charges, but not a hate crime. If authorities were to file a hate crime, it could result
in a longer prison sentence.
Kwok said there is a level of frustration in the Asian American community over prosecutors' refusals to file hate
crime charges.
I think they need to really reassess how they approach it, particularly in this era that we're in, which I think of it
as an emergency area, particularly for Asian Americans as they experience discrimination, he said.
In a statement, the Manhattan District Attorney's office said additional charges may be forthcoming.
Meanwhile, overall hate crimes last year declined by an average of 7% in the 15 cities tracked by the center for
the study of hate and extremism. In New York City, for example, police investigated 265 hate crimes, down from
428 the previous year.
Of the five cities that reported increases, two are in California, including San Jose, which saw an increase of
162%. - VOA

202104,"
An analysis of police department statistics revealed that the United States experienced a significant hike in anti-
Asian hate crimes last year across major cities.
The analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San
Bernardino, this month examined hate crimes in 16 of America's largest cities. It revealed that while such
crimes in 2020 decreased overall by 7 percent, those targeting Asian people rose by nearly 150 percent, NBC
News reported.
Karthick Ramakrishnan, founder and director of demographic data and policy research nonprofit AAPI Data, told
NBC Asian America that while the uptick cannot be entirely attributed to the Donald Trump administration's
incendiary, racist rhetoric about the coronavirus, he believes Trump's wielding of the fact that the virus
originated in China and repeated elevation of the China virus rhetoric did play a part in fostering hate.
What Trump did is that he weaponized it in a way, Ramakrishnan said.
Trump's rhetoric helps set a certain narrative in place - and presidents have an outsized role in terms of shaping
narrative. They don't call it a bully pulpit for nothing, and especially Trump, the way he frequently used Twitter
as well as press conferences and off-the-cuff remarks to campaign rallies to frame the narrative in a particular
way, it likely played a role, Ramakrishnan added.

The analysis revealed a surge in cities such as New York, where anti-Asian hate crimes rose from three in 2019
to 28 in 2020, a 833 percent increase. Los Angeles and Boston also experienced notable rises, from seven to 15
and six to 14, respectively. Meanwhile, Washington, D.C., experienced a decline from six to three anti-Asian hate
crimes. Chicago remained unchanged, with two crimes each year.
Though New York accounts for a sizable portion of the increase, Ramakrishnan stated the increases in other
cities are significant.
We also know that first-generation immigrants tend to underreport acts of racial discrimination and hate crimes,
but the fact that we are talking about change data suggests a meaningful shift that likely means not just greater
reporting, but actually greater occurrence, he continued.
According to the analysis, it's likely that overall hate crimes declined due to the pandemic and a subsequent lack
of interaction in public areas and other gathering places including public transit, commercial businesses, schools
and houses of worship.
The first spike in anti-Asian hate crimes occurred in March and April last year. However, it occurred alongside a
rise in COVID-19 cases and ongoing negative associations of Asian Americans with the virus, the analysis noted.
Ramakrishnan explained that research on Trump's use of racist language in reference to other groups shows
that his language did have a profound impact on how people behave toward marginalized groups.
He noted a 2020 study that examined Trump's comments about Mexican immigrants during his presidential
campaign - when he referred to them as rapists and declared that when Mexico sends its people, they're not
sending the best - found that the inflammatory remarks emboldened certain members of the American public
and gave them license to express deeply held prejudices. Researchers dubbed this the Trump effect or
emboldening effect.
Trump's rhetoric on Latinos in 2016 actually changed people's attitudes and behavior towards Latinos,
Ramakrishnan, who worked on the study, said, adding, So they were more likely to be punitive towards Latinos
in the workplace.
A separate study revealed that the use of China virus language to refer to the coronavirus, particularly by GOP
officials and conservative outlets, has already resulted in a shift in how many people in the US perceive Asian
Americans. The significant uptick in discriminatory coronavirus speech that occurred on March 8 - the day Rep.
Paul Gosar, R-Ariz., tweeted about the Wuhan virus, which coincided with then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's
interview the day before on ""Fox and Friends"" in which he referred to the ""China virus"" - was followed by a rapid
reversal of a decadelong decline in anti-Asian bias.
Research suggests that when people see Asian Americans as being more 'foreign', they are more likely to
express hostility toward them and engage in acts of violence and discrimination, Rucker Johnson, a public policy
professor at the University of California, Berkeley, and co-author of the study, previously told NBC Asian
America.
The new report, however, compares figures from 2019 and 2020, which does not include recent graphic attacks
on Asian American elders earlier this year that have prompted significant media coverage in recent weeks. Many
outlets have attributed the attacks to rhetoric that Trump used during his tenure. But Ramakrishnan cautioned
against defaulting to a simplistic understanding of what's going on.
There's a complex variety of factors, but the fundamental reality is that there's an increase in the number of
Asian Americans who feel unsafe, he stated.
He added more data on the current situation will become available in another year, and until then, it's difficult to
definitively declare that there's been an increase in hate crimes of late. It's possible, Ramakrishnan said, that

Hundreds of people gathered in Seattle on Saturday to protest violence against Asian Americans during the
COVID-19 pandemic.
A crowd gathered in Hing Hay Park in the Chinatown-International District of Seattle for a rally and march
condemning attacks against Asian Americans, including elderly members of the community, the Seattle Times
reported.
Former Washington Gov. Gary Locke (D), the country's first Asian American governor, spoke at the rally and
called for an end to violence against Asian American communities.
This violence against Asian Americans, and especially our elderly, has got to stop, Locke said, adding, We cannot
scapegoat, blame Asian Americans for this virus. Hate is a virus.
At the event, King County Executive Dow Constantine, who is married to a Japanese American woman, declared
that he will propose substantial funding for the education and publicity to address racially based hate and bias in
our community in the upcoming budget.
Noriko Nasu, a Japanese American teacher who was attacked along with her boyfriend close to Hing Hay Park
last month, addressed the demonstrators wearing the same outfit she wore during the assault.

Two videos posted on Facebook on Wednesday showed a New York City subway rider yelling at an Asian man, telling him to move out of his way, and eventually spraying a
can of what appears to be Febreze at him.
The NYPD is investigating the incident, according to the New York Post.
Asian Americans have said they've been the victims of racist attacks because of the coronavirus outbreak that originated in China.
As Asian Americans say they're experiencing more incidents of racism amid the coronavirus outbreak, a worrying video surfaced on Wednesday showing an Asian man being
harassed on the New York City subway and being sprayed with a can of what appears to be Febreze.
Two videos showing the incident were posted on Facebook on Wednesday. The first showed a rider yelling at the Asian man and repeatedly ordering him to move. When people
on the train asked the man why he was asking the stranger to get out of his way, the man shouted, ""Because he's standing right f---ing next to me!""
The upset man then grabs a spray can and starts spraying it at the Asian man, who remained standing near the door of the subway car.
The second video showed the Asian man confronting the other man, asking: ""Why is that? Why can't I sit next to you?""
The New York Police Department confirmed to the New York Post on Thursday that the Hate Crimes Task Force was investigating. A representative said that someone called 911
to report the incident but that by the time officers arrived at the station the train had already departed, so no report was taken.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority retweeted the video on Thursday and described it as racist.
""What works in stopping the spread of Coronavirus: 1. Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds. 2. Cough and sneeze into your elbow. 3. Stay home if you're sick,"" the tweet
said. ""What doesn't work: 1. Racism.""

• Six of the eight people shot dead Tuesday in and near Atlanta were Asian women, authorities say.
• As of early Wednesday, none had been named, but some details were available.
• A 21-year-old white man, Aaron Robert Long, has been arrested over the killings.
* See more stories on Insider's business page.
Most of the people shot dead in massage parlors in and near Atlanta on Tuesday were Asian women.
Law enforcement said that six of the eight victims fit that category. The other two killed were a white woman and a white man.
The killings took place at three businesses in two locations, authorities said. The first was at Young's Asian Massage Parlor in Cherokee County, just outside Atlanta.
Four people were killed there, according to the sheriff's department: two Asian women and the two white victims.
Later, the police were called to Gold Spa in Atlanta, about 30 miles away. The Atlanta Police Department said it found three women shot dead there and a fourth at
Aromatherapy Spa just across the road.
None of the women have been named. According to CNN, authorities are withholding the identities while they inform the victims' next of kin.
According to local Korean-language outlet Atlanta K, the women killed in the Gold Spa were of Korean descent, with one victim in her mid-50s and another in her
mid-70s.
Foreign-ministry officials in South Korea said they had confirmed that four of the women were of Korean descent and were investigating to see whether other victims
were as well.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, has been named by the Atlanta police as the suspect in all eight killings. He was arrested after a car chase south of Atlanta in Crisp County,
some 150 miles away.

Parts of the strip where the last shootings took place are known as Atlanta's red-light district, according to local reports.
No motive for the shootings has been established, but they come amid a spike in attacks on Asian Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic.
A recent study found that reports of hate crimes against Asian Americans increased 150% during the pandemic, while 7% fewer hate crimes overall were reported
during that time.
President Joe Biden addressed the surge in a televised address Friday, calling it ""un-American"" and saying ""it must stop.""
In a statement posted on Twitter, the Stop AAPI Hate group, formed to combat the surge in hate crimes, described the killings as an ""unspeakable tragedy.""
""The reported shootings of Asian American women on Tuesday in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy - for the families of the victims first and foremost, but also for the
AAPI community - which has been reeling from high levels of racial discrimination,"" said the statements.

• Two days after the Atlanta shootings, the House held a hearing to address anti-Asian violence.
• One Republican lawmaker pointed the finger at China and invoked a saying glorifying lynchings.
• Democrats zeroed in on Trump's rhetoric and witnesses described the US's history of scapegoating immigrants.
* See more stories on Insider's business page.
A House judiciary subcommittee held a hearing Thursday to address discrimination and violence against Asian-Americans. The nonprofit organization Stop AAPI Hate
has documented nearly 3,800 incidents of physical assault, shunning, verbal and online harassment, and civil rights violations against the AAPI community in the US
since March 2020, when COVID-19 cases began to surge.
In addition to taking place amid a spike in anti-Asian violence across the country, Thursday's hearing came days after a series of deadly shootings at three Atlanta-
area massage parlors that killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women. Robert Aaron Long, a 21-year-old white man, has been arrested and charged with
murder in connection to the shootings.
Here are 5 key moments from Thursday's hearing
• Rep. Chip Roy employed whataboutism to point the finger at China.
* ""I think the Chinese Communist Party running the country of China, I think they are the bad guys,"" the Texas Republican said. ""I think that they are harming people
and I think they are engaging in modern day slavery.""
• What they are doing to Uighurs ... what they are doing targeting our country ... what they are doing to undermine our national security, and what they are doing to
steal our intellectual property, and what they are doing to build up their military and rattle throughout the Pacific, I think it's patently evil and deserving of
condemnation,"" he added. ""And I think that what they did to hide the reality of this virus is equally deserving of condemnation.""
• Roy quoted an old saying glorifying lynchings at a hearing about racist violence.
* All ""victims of race-based violence and their families deserve justice,"" Roy said. He then tacked on: ""There's old sayings in Texas about find all the rope in Texas and
get a tall oak tree. You know, we take justice very seriously, and we ought to do that. Round up the bad guys.""
-Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) March 18, 2021
• Rep. Grace Meng grew emotional while firing back at Roy.
* ""Your president and your party and your colleagues can talk about issues with any other country that you want, but you don't have to do it by putting a bullseye on
the back of Asian-Americans across this country, on our grandparents, on our kids,"" Meng said.
• The New York congresswoman choked up as she continued, ""This hearing was to address the hurt and pain of our community and to find solutions, and we will not let
you take our voice away from us.""
• Democrats accuse Trump and Republicans of fueling anti-Asian hate by using inflammatory rhetoric about COVID-19.
* Several Democratic lawmakers skewered the former president and his allies for using terms like ""Wuhan virus,"" ""China virus,"" and ""Kung flu"" to describe the
coronavirus pandemic.
• ""As we look at the outrage, let me put into the record: the 45th president always referred to coronavirus as the 'China virus' or 'Kung flu,'"" said Rep. Sheila Jackson
Lee of Texas. ""Let me call his name: President Trump.""
• ""The rise of hate crimes against Asian-Americans is inherently tied to anti-Asian American rhetoric, some of which has come out of this very chamber,"" said freshman
congresswoman Cori Bush. She went on to say that when such rhetoric is used by historically privileged groups, they ""have to own that it causes harm to people,
especially people of color"" because there are ""lives at stake.""
• Witnesses highlighted the US's long history of scapegoating immigrants and minorities in times of crisis.
* ""As shocking as these incidents are, it is so vital to understand that they are not random acts perpetrated by deranged individuals,"" said Erika Lee, a professor of
history and Asian-American studies at the University of Minnesota. ""They are an expression of our country's long history of systemic racism targeting Asian-Americans
and Pacific Islanders.""
• ""We have heard in the past 24 hours many describe anti-Asian discrimination and racial violence as un-American,"" she added. ""Unfortunately, it is very American.""

Although US President Joe Biden signed an executive action banning the use of rhetoric such as the ""China
virus"" or the ""kung flu"" within the federal government, the rise of hate crimes against Asians in the United
States has not been checked.
Many believe that is due to the xenophobia fostered by the previous president, who habitually used such terms
when talking about the pandemic.
An 84-year-old Thai immigrant in San Francisco died last month after being shoved to the ground during his
morning walk. An 89-year-old Chinese American woman was slapped and set on fire by two strangers in New
York. A 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed in the face by a stranger on the New York subway with a box
cutter. These are just some of the recent attacks on Asians in the US.
Although it might be difficult to determine the exact number of such hate crimes and instances of racial
discrimination against Asians in the US, statistics from a number of local police forces, rights groups and
institutes all point to the same conclusion: The surge in assaults and verbal abuse began with the start of the
COVID-19 pandemic in the country a year ago, when the previous US administration baselessly started using
rhetoric blaming China for the spread of the novel coronavirus. It is unlikely to ebb without the state
intervening.

HOST: LISA LAFLAMME
LISA LAFLAMME: On both sides of this closed border, COVID-19 has opened the door to an alarming spike in
anti-Asian hate crimes. Newly released video shows one of the latest disturbing assaults. A 67-year-old man
attacked by three people in a San Francisco Laundromat. The racism, though, has been fuelled not just by the
pandemic, but by politics. Here's CTV's Washington bureau chief Joy Malbon.
JOY MALBON (Reporter): At his tea shop in Washington, Yunhan Zhang worries who will come through the door
next. Last November, a man attacked him with pepper spray, yelling ""Chinese,"" ""COVID."" The assault left him
choking, angry, and sad, blaming an increase of anti-Asian racism in part on the words of Donald Trump.
DONALD TRUMP (Former US President): Some people call it the Chinese flu.
TRUMP: China virus.
TRUMP: Kung flu.
YUNHAN ZHANG (Valley Brooke Tea Owner): When leaders say those things, they lift that very thin layer of
protection. All the bigotry, all the hatred can just be unleashed like that.

ISLAMABAD, March 17 -- Eight people, six of whom were Asian women, were killed in shootings at three
different spas in the US state of Georgia on Tuesday, with a 21-yearold man in custody on suspicion of staging
all three attacks, police said.
The shootings came with many Asian-Americans already on edge following a recent spike in hate crimes against
the community and triggered immediate fears that Asian-run businesses may have been deliberately targeted.
Four of the victims were killed at Young's Asian Massage near Acworth, a suburb of Georgia's capital city
Atlanta, the Atlanta Journal- Constitution reported.
Captain Jay Baker of the Cherokee County sheriff's office told the paper the victims were two Asian women, a
white woman, and a white man, while a Hispanic man was wounded.
The Atlanta police department separately confirmed that four women were found dead at two business
establishments in northeast Atlanta, identified as the Gold Massage Spa and Aroma Therapy spa.
Police told the Atlanta Journal- Constitution that all four Atlanta victims were Asian women.
South Korea's Yonhap News Agency reported the country's foreign ministry had confirmed that four of the
victims were of Korean descent.

202104,"
SAN FRANCISCO – A recent surge in assaults and harassment of Asian Americans in Northern California has
mobilized activists, organizers, and those that live there to keep their communities safe.
In one week in February, a 91-year-old man in Oakland Chinatown was brutally assaulted, a Thai man was
attacked and killed in San Francisco and a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in San Jose.
The attacks pushed Jacob Azevedo to reach out on social media, offering to walk with anyone in the Oakland
community who was feeling unsafe, especially older Asian Americans.
His Instagram post gained widespread attention, prompting four community members to reach out to him with
organizing help.
And now, a month later, 700 people have signed up with Compassion in Oakland to escort older Asian Americans
in the Bay Area community.
But that's only a part of what Compassion in Oakland does, Jess Owyoung, one of the four people to reach out
and help form the group, told USA TODAY.
""What we've been doing is going out into Oakland Chinatown and just talking to business owners, talking to
community members, talking to elderly, looking for places where we could be of help,"" she said, detailing that

There's an old saying about traditions: Abandon a tradition, it tells us, and you will soon learn why it became
one.
That's what California cities are learning today, as city councils around the state have acted on the urging of
Black Lives Matter protesters and diverted portions of their former police budgets to social action causes in
previously underserved neighborhoods.
But the spate of anti-Asian violence now playing out in California communities as disparate as Sacramento, San
Jose, Los Angeles, San Leandro and Orange County dramatically shows this was folly.
The logical police response to on-street attacks ought to be more foot and squad car patrols, but that's not
happening in most places despite the rise in anti-Asian hate crimes. So they continue, showing no signs of
abating.
Before the coronavirus pandemic, this was not a big problem. Hate crimes against Asians were relatively few
and far between. But a huge upswing began just about the time ex-President Donald Trump dubbed the
coronavirus plague the ""Chinese virus,"".
Around California, these crimes have far more than doubled over the last year, but no one can put a precise
number on them. In San Francisco, they have at least tripled. In Los Angeles, there have been more than twice
as many this year as a year ago. But official numbers are likely far lower than in real life, partly because police

don't do much about the attacks.
Not even 700-person rallies decrying the attacks, like one the other day in San Jose, can stop them.
The head of a Southern California group called Asian-Americans Advancing Justice told one reporter many such
crimes go unreported because of language problems, immigrants unable to communicate with police. Plus, she
said, ""When victims...come forward, having the police say nothing can be done discourages other victims from
relying on police.""
Some immigrant advocates also say Korean-Americans and other Asian groups are perceiving new bias among
police officers, perhaps caused by the Trump rhetoric.
But the mere presence of cops on street patrol could have stopped one early March assault on an elderly Asian
man who was seated in a Nob Hill laundromat in San Francisco when at attacker ambushed him. Police presence
probably would have spared the death of Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai-American beaten to death in
broad daylight, also in San Francisco.
Neither of their assailants has been identified, like most others conducting the current spate of attacks.
There are also less violent, but still threatening incidents. One Asian-American woman stopped at a red light the
other day in Fresno and a man in the next car signaled she should roll down her window. When she did, he
shouted, ""Get out of my country — that's an order."" After pausing, he reportedly added, ""I'll kill you.""
All this is a demonstration that even a ""model minority"" noted for high achievement and founding large and
successful businesses of many types can suddenly be targeted, especially when national leaders become loose-
lipped about their own prejudices.
It also shows that not only California, but the entire nation needs effective policing to protect minorities who
have no way to know when they might be victimized, even if their particular ethnic group enjoys generally high
public esteem.
Because bigots have always picked on those they see as weak, this is especially important for elderly and frail
individuals.
Yes, the pandemic appears to have originated in or near the Chinese city of Wuhan. But there is no evidence it
was deliberately perpetrated on the world. The claim that it was amounts to a blood libel against Chinese
individuals who would have been thousands of miles away even if deeds like this had been done.
Because most others have difficulty discerning Asians' native nationalities simply from their appearance, all
Asian-Americans are now at serious risk, especially if they don't look strong, a la the Los Angeles Angels' 6-foot,
4-inch, 210 pound Shohei Otani.
Police are their only assured protection from random violence and bigotry when they leave their homes. And the
fewer cops on the street, the more danger for them. Which is just one reason it makes little sense to defund
police, as Americans are now discovering.

Sakhone Lasaphangthong wants people to notice him.
“Oh, they know it’s me,” he said while walking the streets of Oakland’s Chinatown. “I’m almost 6-foot, bald-
headed, with glasses on. You know when they see me, I stand out.”
He sees this as a good thing. He wants people to ask him for help.

Sakhone is the director of housing services at Family Bridges, a nonprofit in Oakland, California, and he’s also
part of the area's Community Ambassador program.
Community ambassadors walk the streets of Chinatown to care for the neighborhood and help residents feel
safe. They do things like sweep sidewalks, fix kids’ bikes and help with vaccine clinics.

shouted in public, kids bullied in schools, and most recently, the unpredictable attacks on older Asian Americans.
Some say the uptick can be linked to rhetoric used by former President Donald Trump, who dubbed the
coronavirus the “China virus” in public remarks.
An 84-year old man from Thailand was attacked and knocked to the ground during his morning walk in San
Francisco. He died two days later. In another incident, a 61-year-old Filipino American was slashed in the face on
the New York City subway.
Oakland's Chinatown has also seen attacks like this. In a virtual tour of the area via FaceTime, Sakhone shows
the spot where a 91-year-old man was shoved to the ground a few weeks ago. He said he regrets that he wasn’t
there to help.
“Yeah, if I see them fall down, I'll rush to help,” Sakhone said. “I always keep an eye on them.”

------------
Sakhone walks the streets of Chinatown every morning as shopkeepers set up their fruit stands and seniors take
their morning strolls. He greets many of them by name.
A grocer runs over to give him a bag of fresh oranges when he spots Sakhone coming down the street. Take it,
he gestures with his hands. Sakhone will share it when he brings a cup of coffee to a man sleeping on the
streets a few blocks away.
Most residents here speak Cantonese, but Sakhone, whose family is from Laos, does not. Yet, they still manage
to communicate by tapping him on the shoulder or waving him over when they need help - like the time an
elderly woman had her walker stolen.
Sakhone and the woman went in search of it together but her knee buckled every few steps as they canvassed
the streets. Eventually, he bought her a new walker, he recalled.
“A lot of folks are worried. ... But at the same time, when I'm around, they know that I'm there to help look
over them.”
Sakhone Lasaphangthong, community ambassador, Chinatown, Oakland, California
“A lot of folks are worried,” Sakhone said, and some older residents aren’t even leaving their homes with the
rise in attacks. “But at the same time, when I'm around, they know that I'm there to help look over them.”
Just the presence of ambassadors like Sakhone seems to make a difference.

But building this kind of trust took time given that the Community Ambassadors initiative didn’t start as a
neighborhood watch program. It started in 2017 to help give former inmates from San Quentin prison the
opportunity to do dignified work and rebuild relationships with the community.
------------
Sakhone had been incarcerated for 20 years before he was released in 2018. To stop crime, he said you need to
know why it happens. He explained how in the pandemic, people have lost their jobs, rent prices in Oakland and
elsewhere have skyrocketed, and many people have lost their homes, too. All these stresses can compound
mental health.

“They have no right to do it, but it's like one way that folks express their traumas and their hurt or their pain
is to take it out on people,” Sakhone said. “And it's not right. But the pandemic is hard for every community -
it's hard for everyone.”

A special police task force is being developed to address hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders in Oakland. But some community members say that in reality, most people here won’t call the
police given a history of mistrust and lack of response.
“I don't believe in more policing, I believe in more communication so that we could avoid these kinds of hate
crimes from happening.""
Sakhone Lasaphangthong, community ambassador, Chinatown, Oakland, California
“I don't believe in more policing, I believe in more communication so that we could avoid these kinds of hate
crimes from happening,” Sakhone said.
Many residents want justice for hate crime victims, while advocates like Sakhone believe in restorative
justice. When he sees conflict or tension, he tries to deescalate the situation by understanding the
perspectives of all those involved.
“One of my approaches is to ask if they're OK. You know, 'What's going on? What do you need?'” he said.
Once home to immigrants and working-class families, the neighborhoods around Chinatown are gentrifying
and now boast luxury condos, as well. Some locals say that people don’t know each other, and don't look out
for each other the way they used to. Rebuilding these relationships, they say, would help make the
neighborhood safer.

------------
Beyond the noodle shops, fruit stands, some of the best dim sum in the Bay area, and a church with closed
doors and a quiet playground, there’s Madison Park, where a dozen elders perform their morning tai chi.
Here, Sakhone’s friend, Lee Zitsue, another community ambassador, waited for a grandmother shopping for
groceries nearby, so he could walk her home.
They often say they’ll take 15-20 minutes, but it’s more like 30-40 minutes, he chuckled.
When he went to pick her up at the store where she’d been shopping though, he couldn’t find her.
“Oh man, now you got me scared,” Lee said. “I’m scared that she got lost. It’s just the opportunity for crime
is so high.”
Lee went out to look for her and learned later that she had left on her own, eager to get back home.
With the weather getting warmer and people getting vaccinated, Chinatown will grow busier soon. Some fear
this means they’ll see more hate crime, so the ambassadors say they’re looking for more volunteers.

My parents live on the outskirts of Atlanta, and I am worried about them.
Since the start of the pandemic, there has been a significant uptick in hate crimes against Asians in America. In
the past few weeks, we've seen horrifying reports of Asian Americans being harassed and punched, an elderly
man thrown to the ground and killed in San Francisco, another slashed in the face and left to bleed inside a New
York City subway car, as well as countless videos of enraged people shouting at Asian Americans to go back to
their countries and even spitting in their faces.
The recent turn of events is shocking but not surprising. For many Asian Americans, anti-Asian sentiments are
borne in silence and isolation. I grew up mostly being embarrassed about my Korean heritage. In the U.S., we
Koreans have to prove that we are American, even if we were born and raised here, by pushing ourselves to
excel at school and work. As children, some of us refused to learn to speak Korean. By doing so, we shed much
of our ethnic identities.
I was always acutely aware of how I should try to fit in. When I was 4 years old, we moved to Vancouver,
Canada, where we lived in a predominantly white neighborhood. When I started elementary school in the late
1970s, many people had never heard of Korea. Another Asian girl in my class by the name of Ming Ming would
sit at the corner of one of the long lunch tables with her thermos of noodles. The other children would wince at
the smell. I did not fare better. Next to her, I would open up my doshirak, a Korean lunch box packed with fried

New York, March 17 (IANS) The man who killed eight people in shootings at Atlanta massage parlours may have
been impelled by ""sex addiction"", officials said on Wednesday although six of the victims were of Asian descent.
A 21-year-old White man, Robert Aaron Long, is in custody and he has admitted to carrying out the Tuesday
evening shooting at three locations, officials said.
The killings of people of Asian descent came as the country was being swept by a wave of violence against
them.
But Sheriff's Office Captain Jay Baker said at a news conference on Wednesday that two of the victims were
White and that Long ""does claim that it was not racially motivated"".
Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Long ""made indicators that he has some issues, potentially sexual addiction, and
may have frequented some of these places in the past"".
Baker added that Long told them he considered the spas ""as an outlet for him"" to do ""something he shouldn't be
doing"" and that he wanted ""to take out that temptation"".
Seven of those killed were women and the South Korean Foreign Ministry said that four of them were of Korean
descent.

At least two Lehigh Valley colleges have issued statements of support for members of the Asian, Asian American
and Pacific Islander communities as instances of harassment and violence against them increase during the
coronavirus pandemic.
In a letter sent to students and staff Wednesday, Lafayette College officials denounced ""all such racially
motivated and xenophobic acts of harassment and violence"" and urged members of the community to stand in
solidarity with those on the receiving end of it.
Last week, Muhlenberg College President Kathleen Harring sent a similar letter to students and staff, saying the
""rise in physical violence against Asian Americans is alarming and compounds the issues of inequity felt among
Asian American communities during the pandemic.""
""Our Asian students, faculty and staff are struggling with the insidious anti-Asian hate that continues to pervade
society - both nearby and around the world,"" Harring said. ""Muhlenberg condemns all forms of racism and
stands in solidarity with our Asian American, Asian and Pacific Islander community members. We support them
with steadfast resolve.""
Researchers have seen a marked uptick in racist attacks against Asians and Asian Americans during the
pandemic, attributed at least in part to former President Donald Trump's habit of blaming China for spreading
the coronavirus.

An accused attacker who left an Asian man clinging to life after stabbing the stranger on a Manhattan street has a
history of violence and mental illness - but never showed any obvious signs of racial bias, his family says.
Salman Muflehi, 23, who was charged Thursday with knifing the 36-year-old victim in Chinatown, often threatened
family members when he was off his medication, and was previously charged with assaulting his brother in 2019 and
for attacking another man in Sunset Park, Brooklyn, this year.
But Muflehi - initially charged last week with two counts of a hate crime before prosecutors said there was no
evidence the stabbing was racially motivated - never displayed any biased tendencies, said his brother Montaser
Muflehi.
""He didn't care about colors, he doesn't care about that. ... If he sees someone look at him, or talking on the phone
and look at him, he thinks they're talking about him,"" 26-year-old Montaser told the Daily News on Sunday. ""We did

The stabbing incident is one of the latest in a series of random attacks on Asian-Americans across the city.
Police have made 18 arrests in 28 incidents of ""COVID-related"" hate crimes against Asians since the start of the
pandemic, though the commanding officer of the NYPD Asian Hate Crimes Task Force acknowledged many more

Before coronavirus shut down businesses in Sunset Park and wiped away foot traffic along Seventh Ave., this
patch of Brooklyn was a safe spot, certainly not the kind of place where a man would get killed defending a
robbery victim, residents said.
But here they were Wednesday, friends, family, strangers, united in grief over two deaths: the killing of a Good
Samaritan trying to break up a fight outside a gambling den, and the demise of neighborhood safety and
relative peace of mind.
""I'm just kind of surprised that something happened here,"" said Chris Bittmann, 20, who works for New York
Life and moved to Sunset Park with his girlfriend a year ago because of its reputation for safety. ""The people
around here are good people. There's been a spike of crime during COVID, but it hadn't really reached this area.
I moved here because it was safe here.""
Shi Quan Lin, 28, has lived in the neighborhood 20 years. He can count on his thumbs the number of times he
has walked by a crime scene.
""We don't really have murders here,"" he said. ""Because of COVID, no one is really on the street so they see an
opportunity. Usually at that hour, there are tons of people walking around.""

A 56-year-old Asian man was pummeled by a stranger during an unprovoked attack on the Lower East Side,
officials said Wednesday.
The Tuesday night beatdown was the latest in a series of random attacks on Asian-Americans across the city.
The victim, Teoh Ming, of Brooklyn, was approaching the East Broadway subway station near Rutgers St. when
his attacker stormed up and punched him about 8:50 p.m., knocking him to the ground.
Ming, a Malaysian immigrant of Chinese descent, said he's lived in the city for more than 20 years, and he still
likes New York City.
""This is something I can't understand. I don't know what happened. I was going down the steps and he was
coming up,"" he said.
""He hit me three times,"" he said, pointing to his black left eye and his cut lip.
""And the rest, I don't remember anything after that. I fell down and I don't know what happened next.""
The battered victim did not know the man or have any interaction with him before he was attacked, police said.
Ming said he was on his way home from his construction job in Chinatown when he was attacked. He doesn't

Attacks in recent weeks against Asians on the West Coast and in New York City have put Long Islanders like Kathy Wong on edge and
more on guard.
The New Hyde Park mother of three watched in horror the recent footage of an Asian woman being shoved to the ground outside a
bakery in Queens.
""I saw her starting to back up. The fear was already there before she was pushed,"" Wong recalled of seeing the video in February on
the evening news. ""When he pushed her with such force [to] the ground, I automatically thought of my own mother. I automatically
thought of my daughter.""
Violent assaults nationwide in the past two months have intensified fears among some Asian Americans on the Island. Some grew so
concerned over the safety of vulnerable elders that they are advising them to avoid public transportation and are limiting their own
trips outdoors, and have kept their children at home to learn remotely on top of worries of COVID-19 risks.
During a prime-time speech Thursday night to mark the start of the one-year anniversary of the global coronavirus pandemic,
President Joe Biden condemned ""vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who've been attacked, harassed, blamed and
scapegoated"" during the pandemic.
""It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop,"" he said.
Suffolk County police said they are investigating two reports of hate incidents with Asian victims but reported no cases of violent
assaults targeting Asians. In one case, police said an Asian employee of a liquor store in Brentwood received ""a threatening phone
call based on his race/ethnicity"" last April. In another, anti-Asian graffiti was painted on the rear door of a Selden business in
September. Both are under investigation.
Nassau police said they received no reports of anti-Asian hate crimes in the past year but handled a bias incident last June in Jericho
where one woman used an expletive before calling the other woman ""Chinese,"" to which the victim, who is Asian, responded that her

ethnicity was not Chinese.
Violent attacks increase
Nationwide, reports of violent attacks against Asians have surged this year.
An 84-year-old Thai man died after he was thrown to the pavement in San Francisco in January. A 91-year-old man was injured after
being shoved in Oakland's Chinatown. In Manhattan, a man came up behind a 36-year-old Asian man walking on a street in
Chinatown and stabbed him in the torso, leaving the victim hospitalized in critical condition. The woman whose assault in Flushing so
frightened Wong was treated with stitches for a gash on her forehead. Earlier this week, a 75-year-old Asian man was robbed during
a stroll in Oakland that left him seriously injured. From 2019 to 2020, the NYPD reported a jump from three to 28 hate crime
incidents involving Asians.
Kevin Sun, co-president of the Great Neck Chinese Association, said he has heard a handful of first-person accounts where drivers in
passing cars hurled racial slurs at Asians walking on the street with their groceries.
The recent attacks prompted Vivian Luk, of Albertson, to tell her mother to avoid taking the Long Island Rail Road to travel to
Flushing for a doctor's appointment last month. Her mother ended up taking a cab.
""It feels like it's stripping away our freedom. ... It angers me, obviously. It worries me even more,"" said Luk, 41, who emigrated from
Hong Kong to the United States when she was a child. ""I feel like we can't freely walk around. I feel like I'm going to be a target.""
Luk is not alone in worrying about staying safe on public transportation. Shaorui Li, chair of the Asian American Association of
Greater Stony Brook, remembered reading about Asian women being attacked on subway trains and at train platforms.
""It triggers fear,"" said Li, of Setauket. ""Some of my friends commute to the city. Their family members became scared [of] what
could happen at subway stations.""
Some advocates and experts have tied the rise in anti-Asian crime during the pandemic to the economic downturn, geopolitical
tensions and the rhetoric of politicians like former President Donald Trump, who repeatedly called COVID-19 a ""Chinese virus.""
""We've seen racism during times of war, pandemic and economic downturn. Last year, we saw all three,"" said Russell Jeung, a
professor at San Francisco State University and co-founder of STOP AAPI HATE, a national database that collects self-reported hate
incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""We had the worst recession since the Great Depression. And we had the U.S.-China Cold War,"" Jeung said. ""Then again President
Trump's rhetoric inflamed hatred and gave people the license to push and shove others.""
Since March, Jeung's group has documented more than 3,000 complaints, including 16 cases of verbal harassment, shunning and
being barred from establishments on Long Island as of the end of February.
""There's widespread worry over safety,"" said Weiwei Zhang, of Mt. Sinai, a board member of the Suffolk County Asian American
Advisory Board, in Mandarin. ""As far as I'm aware of, there are no attacks on individuals here in Suffolk. But people are becoming
more careful about when and where they go.""
Farrah Mozawalla, executive director of Nassau County's Office of Asian American Affairs, said her office has received reports of about
a half- dozen anti-Asian harassment incidents since last March, including a Filipino woman being told to go back to her country in a
Costco in Nassau County.
""With these anti-Asian sentiments ... people are apprehensive,"" Mozawalla said. ""They feel uncomfortable. They feel like they don't
belong. We want to make sure that they know they are part of the county.""
A ""Stand Up to Hate"" rally is scheduled for 11 a.m. Sunday outside the Nassau County Legislative Building in Mineola.
Painful memories
For those who have endured the sting of racism and marginalization, the wave of anti-Asian discrimination has evoked painful
memories and opened new wounds.
When Wong was about 8, she said her family heard a loud bang on the door one night at their house in Bayside, Queens. When her
parents opened the door, the family saw newspapers lit on fire in front of their doorstep. It wasn't until they put the fire out that they
realized that the newspapers were wrapped around feces.

Peter Au felt encouraged to see that hundreds showed up Sunday in Mineola to condemn the violent attacks that
have spread fear among the Asian American community.
Au, a financial adviser who commutes weekly to Flushing, Queens, for work, said he worries about his safety.
""On the way to my office even during broad daylight, I still feel the fear,"" said Au, 45, of Garden City, at the end
of the hourlong rally. ""I don't know if anybody was going to walk behind me and start attacking me.""
Just last month, a man came up behind a 36-year-old Asian man walking on a street in Manhattan's Chinatown
and stabbed him in the torso, leaving the victim hospitalized in critical condition.
""It's been a very, very tragic year in 2020. Not only did we have to fight COVID-19, as a minority living in this
country we also had to fight racism,"" Au said. ""I'm glad that there's a huge turnout today and see so many
different groups supporting us.""
The rally held outside the Nassau County Legislative Building drew about 300 attendees, many of whom held up
signs that said ""END VIOLENCE AGAINST ASIANS"" and ""Justice for Grandpa VICHA,"" the first name of Vicha

Amid a recent spate of crimes aimed at Asian Americans, four Bergen County boroughs have passed resolutions
decrying the violence and declaring racism ""a public health crisis.""
Leonia, Fort Lee, Dumont and Harrington Park each adopted the identical statements.
They promised to support measures at the municipal and state level to ""advance efforts to dismantle systemic
racism,"" without discussing specific policies.
The towns called on local, county and state officials to ""denounce racism, xenophobia and intolerance in all
forms and stand with us in solidarity with the Asian and Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders communities.""
Hate crimes motivated by anti-Asian sentiment have soared in New York City. There were 27 racially motivated
crimes against people of Asian descent reported last year, compared to one in 2019, according to the NYPD.
Across the country in 2020, there were almost 3,000 reports of anti-Asian discrimination between March 19 and
Dec. 31, according to the Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The problem has been highlighted by a string of recent assaults, including a January attack that killed 84-year-
old Vicha Ratanapakdee in San Francisco in January. In February, a group of Korean American teens from North
Jersey faced a verbal assault in New York's Times Square. Leonia High School sophomore Yena Choe said a
middle-aged woman glared at the group of face-masked youths and told them, ""Get away from me!"" while

waving her hands.
In Wyckoff, meanwhile, a Chinese restaurant was vandalized last June with the words ""coronavirus"" and ""go
home"" spray-painted on the windows and sidewalk.
During his first prime-time address to the nation Thursday, President Joe Biden denounced violent attacks
against Asian Americans during the coronavirus pandemic as un-American.
Discussing how the pandemic had served to divide and antagonize Americans on a range of issues, Biden called
out ""vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who've been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.""
""At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans, are on the front lines of this pandemic trying to
save lives,"" Biden said.
""And still, still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America. It's wrong, it's
un-American and it must stop.""
In Bergen County, where 17% of people identify as Asian, according to the 2019 Census, the four boroughs
spoke out with resolutions warning not to scapegoat local residents just because the virus originated in China.
The text of the resolutions is as follows:
Condemn and denounce racism, xenophobia and intolerance in all forms.
Call on public officials in other municipalities and at the state level to condemn and denounce racism,
xenophobia and intolerance in all forms and stand with us in solidarity with the Asian and Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders communities.
Continues to promote and advocate for equality and equity through all policies approved by the mayor and
council.
Recognize the dedication of Asian and Asian-American frontline medical workers, teachers, police and fire
officers and essential workers.
Continue to advocate locally and through the New Jersey State League of Municipalities, New Jersey Conference
of Mayors and all other appropriate associations for relevant policies that improve health in communities of
color.
Support local, state, regional, and federal initiatives that advance efforts to dismantle systemic racism.
Further work to solidify alliances and partnerships with other organizations that are confronting racism and
encourage other local, state, regional and national entities to recognize racism as a public health crisis.
Support community efforts to amplify community efforts to be anti-racist and to combat discrimination and
xenophobia while engaging actively and authentically with communities of color wherever they live.
Promote and support policies and resources that prioritize the health of all people, such as bystander
intervention programs.
Encourage racial equity training among all community partners, vendors and contractors.
Call upon Bergen County Executive Tedesco and the Bergen County Board of Chosen Freeholders to declare
racism as a public health crisis and to enact equity in all policies in the County of Bergen.

202003,"
Since the summer of 2020 anti-racism has become a new battle cry in the fight for racial justice and re-
energized the movement. Asian communities are in crisis and need some of that same energy now. Since the
beginning of the pandemic, Asians have been and continue to be targeted with increasing violence at alarming
rates, reinforcing their existence as perpetual foreigners who do not truly belong here, whether born here or
not. The history of anti-Asian racism is long in the United States; this is the latest chapter of America not
wanting them here.
The U.S. reluctantly tolerated Chinese immigrants in the mid-1860s for backbreaking dangerous railroad work
that white workers would not do in order to connect the U.S. with the Transcontinental Railroad. Soon afterward,
the danger of Yellow Peril became a concern and in 1882, the first American stance on anti-immigration would
be the catalyst for future immigration policies, better known as the Chinese Exclusion Act. In February 1942, the
U.S. rounded up and interned Japanese Americans and Asian Americans of non-Japanese descent after the
bombing of Pearl Harbor.
The model minority myth has been, and continues to be, used as a racial wedge to further policies against Black
communities (and other nonwhite groups). But has there been progress? Well there's a whole heritage month
for Asians in May. Now think back to how many non-Asians posted about it on their social media as they do for
Pride, Black History, or Hispanic Heritage months. AAPI Awareness Month did not even become official until
1992. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic made navigating public spaces dangerous for Asians. The prior
administration's insistence to call it the China/Chinese virus only helped to incite anti-Asian attacks to startling
numbers. In April, NBC News reported over 30% of Americans have witnessed COVID-19 bias against Asians.

""China virus.""
Those words were once again uttered by the twice-impeached, former president of the United States last weekend in Orlando and, as has become
the status quo, they were met with rambunctious applause from the Republican Party faithful.
For the better part of a year, the highest power in the land, the person with the largest microphone in the land, repeatedly used the phrases
""China Virus"" and ""Kung-Flu"" to describe COVID-19.
Let me tell you something, anybody who looks like me knows exactly what that means. What the intent of using those words actually is. Make no
mistake about it, it is 100% racism and for the people who say it, and the people who look past it, and the people who don't immediately
denounce it, and denounce it every time that is said, you are complicit actors in spreading the kind of racism that ultimately has escalated itself
into violence and murder.
I fear that the violence against Asian Americans will only get worse. I fear that people like me, who have a platform, who have the responsibility
and opportunity to speak out, could be the next victims of violence. It's a fear that I carry with me everywhere I go. Every knock at the door.
Every time I get out of the car to fill up my gas tank. Every time I run to the grocery store. It's a fear that will always be there as long as people
who are in power and who seek power see fit to use racism as their preferred instrument of war.
If the events of Jan. 6 should tell us anything, it's that members of the Cult of Trump take very literally the extreme and dangerous things said by
Donald Trump and his fellow arsonists of democracy. They aren't just empty words. They are directives. They are orders. And these white
nationalists are willing to act on them.
According to Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks attacks against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, there have been more than 3,000 reports of
racism and discrimination against Asian Americans in the past year. Two weeks ago, a man was caught on tape attacking an Asian American
woman in Flushing, Queens, a main hub for the Asian American community. An 84-year old Asian American was attacked while taking a walk
through his Bay Area neighborhood, and he died two days later. The rise in violence prompted the state of California to commit $1.4 million
toward helping Asian Americans report hate crimes.
The Biden administration released an executive order acknowledging ""the Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in
furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the
geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.""
It's a symbolic first step and a meaningful one after watching the highest officeholder in the land use the White House microphone to hurl racial
slurs against the AAPI community for a year. But the reality is we need more than just symbolic gestures and occasional mentions. Asian

202003,"
I was fighting racist mac and cheese in Philadelphia last week.
Vichar Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man, was shoved to his death in Oakland, Calif., on Jan. 28 after recently receiving his first dose of
the COVID-19 vaccine. Christian Hall, a Chinese adoptee, was shot to death in December by Pennsylvania State Police in the Poconos, his
hands up in supplication. These are just two examples from dozens of reports of violence and hate against Asians in America documented
since last March.
Amid all this, I had to fight racist mac and cheese.
Yes, the mac is real. A Roxborough restaurant called housemade mac topped with “Chinese chili garlic sauce” its “COVID Mac,” as CBS
reported last week. Days later, the Mayor’s Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs, of which I am the treasurer, released a joint
statement with the full suite of the mayor’s commissions and the Office of Immigrant Affairs to disavow racist attacks on Asian Americans,
including but not limited to the menu item. Meanwhile, its creators have since tried to delete it from memory, which is the most telling thing
about it.
In the lede of a Feb. 22 Washington Post article, the attacks on Asian Americans are described as “high profile.” High profile is not the phrase
we use in my family to describe being spat at, hearing slurs yelled at us. Those aren’t the words we use when a Chinese grandmother is
beaten up on the street. High profile isn’t how we describe being deported because we pray to the wrong God or pay too little to be here.
High profile isn’t how we describe being jailed because we don’t speak English, being evicted because we don’t have citizenship. When those
things happen, we don’t call the story high profile. We use words like tragic, hate-filled, frightening. High-profile attacks is a phrase that
happens when we Asian Americans are treated as data, as ingredients. It reduces us to shocking news items that prompt brief hand-wringing
before most coverage moves on. We don’t begin to understand how we are victims of hate by counting how many witnesses we had.
The news this month isn’t that Americans hate Asians. That is not news to us. The news is that others need the news to remind them that
Asians in America deserve to be treated as complete humans. The news is that anti-Asian prejudice runs so deep I have to spend time
fighting racist — yes, racist — mac and cheese that equates an Asian condiment with COVID-19.
I see many Americans are reiterating the history of the exclusion act, internment order, the travel bans, to remind some abstract “us” that
some abstract “America” criminalized participation in the human experiment for Asian immigrants and their descendants. The secret is that
the “us” and the “America” are the same: a popular majority voted for the presidents who signed these orders. Yet, even after so many “high
profile” incidents of hate, America still hasn’t learned its lesson.

They gather almost every night at San Francisco’s Dragon Gate, the ornately decorated entrance to the
nation’s oldest Chinatown. Armed with only whistles and pamphlets, the volunteer neighborhood patrol roams
the streets, checking out ATMs and mom-andpop shops in areas where Asian residents have experienced attacks
that have left this neighborhood on edge.
Some volunteers drive more than an hour to walk these blocks — largely deserted by a combination of fear and
pandemic lockdown — to hand out bilingual fliers that explain how to report a crime to police. Similar patrols
have sprouted in Asian neighborhoods in Oakland, Calif., Los Angeles and New York City, a response to what
these communities say is a wave of racist violence and harassment since headlines about a virus from China
began appearing in U.S. media a year ago.
Data is scant, but at least two U.S. cities logged an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020.
The New York Police Department reported at least 28 hate crimes that targeted Asian American victims last year,
compared with three the previous year. San Francisco’s preliminary data shows that nine hate crimes targeted
Asian Americans in 2020, up from six the year before and four in 2018.
Several viral videos of attacks on Asian pedestrians in February have heightened concerns: a Filipino man
slashed with a box cutter on a New York City train; a 52-year-old woman shoved to the ground in Flushing,

Queens; a woman punched in the face on a New York subway platform; and a Los Angeles man beaten with his
own cane at a bus stop.
It’s unclear whether the violence in each of those viral videos was racially motivated, but the incidents have left
Asian Americans feeling not only under attack but also largely alone in addressing neighborhood crime, with
many of the assailants remaining elusive. While some residents have joined neighborhood patrols, others are
arming themselves for protection. And still others have pushed for law enforcement to create task forces and
liaisons to better address neighborhood concerns.
“People are fed up about not being heard, not being seen and waiting for help,” said Will Lex Ham, an activist
who has participated in the San Francisco Chinatown street patrols and organized rallies in New York. “We’re not
getting the allyship we need, the resources we need. We have to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps.”
Public attention to attacks on Asian Americans soared after 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee was assaulted in
San Francisco in January. According to his son-in-law Eric Lawson, he was on his daily neighborhood walk and
recovering from multiple heart surgeries when he was shoved so violently that he later died.
“Thai grandpa,” as he was known by community activists, became a rallying cry for celebrities and other Asian
Americans who added his face to their social media profile pictures. His daughter Amy Ratanapakdee believes it
was a hate crime.
“It’s like a senseless act of violence and could happen to any one of us,” she said, adding that her own children
have been called racial epithets on the street during the past year. “I want everyone to know how my father
died and hope that in his memory, people will join me to hope that justice presides.”
A 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to murder in Ratanapakdee’s attack. And a suspect has been arrested
in the case of Noel Quintana, the 61-year-old Filipino man whose face was slashed on a New York City subway
train as he traveled to work earlier in February.
“Nobody came, nobody helped, nobody made a video,” he said.
Quintana reported the crime to police, and the suspect has been charged with assault. But many cases never
get that far.
Victims from marginalized communities can be reluctant to engage with police because of cultural differences,
language barriers or distrust. Even when they do report, proving that they were targeted because of their race is
difficult.
To fill in the data gap, some Asian American organizations are tracking these incidents on their own. Stop AAPI
Hate was launched last March to collect information on suspected cases of racially motivated violence and
harassment. (AAPI stands for Asian American Pacific Islander.) It received more than 2,808 self-reported
incidents from across the country by year’s end.
Of those incidents, 9 percent were physical assaults and 71 percent were verbal attacks. Among the victims,
most were women, and about 126 reported being older than 60.
“We were flooded immediately with hundreds of incidents,” said Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American
studies at San Francisco State University, who helped launch the site. “We have large numbers of elderly
reporting that you wouldn’t think would complain, but they knew racism when they experienced it.”
Of the self-reported victims, 41 percent were Chinese, 15 percent were Korean, 8 percent were Vietnamese and
7 percent were Filipino. States with higher Asian populations report more incidents, with California most
represented, followed by New York at about 13 percent.

But some Asian communities suspect that the rash of attacks is even worse than the data suggests. The
tendency to underreport is why Iona Cheng thinks her community in Oakland has become a target.
“They’re attacking Asian women, often for cultural reasons. They don’t speak out. They don’t press charges.
They don’t speak English well in some cases,” said Cheng, who is Chinese American.
The 48-year-old cancer epidemiologist had just delivered a Christmas gift in late December when a group of
preteens tackled her to the ground, punched and robbed her. Police believe the same group stomped on an
Asian woman in her 60s later that night, breaking her kneecap.
“I can’t walk outside the door of my house and feel safe,” said Cheng, who added that someone called her
“coronavirus” while she was jogging last March in Oakland. “I just feel like that was taken from me.”
Gun ownership has become a solution for some. David Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety in the
predominantly Asian city of Arcadia, Calif., said his 2020 sales soared four times higher than in a typical year.
Liu said he saw an uptick in Asian Americans interested in purchasing firearms, but interest has been
skyrocketing among “basically everybody.”
National gun sales are not tracked by race or ethnicity, but in a survey by the National Shooting Sports
Foundation last year, gun retailers estimated a nearly 43 percent average increase in sales to Asian customers
in the first half of 2020 — the smallest jump among the four reported racial or ethnic groups. By comparison,
the survey estimated an average sales increase of 52 percent to White customers and 58 percent to Black
customers.
San Francisco social worker Jason Gee decided to buy a handgun in the spring after a series of incidents that
included an assault, a home invasion and the breaking of his car windows. And on his way to buy the gun, in
the parking lot, four White men called him and his friend “the coronavirus” and “c----s.”
While in line to buy the firearm, Gee said, he noticed that most of the customers were also Asian.
But he soon started to worry that his purchase was “playing to fear” and ultimately making his community
less safe, and decided to sell the firearm back.
“If you show up here . . . expecting violence, that may put you in a certain mind frame where you may
misread a situation and respond to it with violence.”
Local leaders have made similar pleas, including Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong, who expressed
concern about civilian gun owners creating “unintended victims.”
He held a news conference on Feb. 16 after a Chinatown shopkeeper was jailed for allegedly firing his weapon
at a man he believed was robbing a woman on the street. “We don’t want people to fire weapons into our
community,” he said. “While we appreciated people’s interest in keeping our community safe, we want them
to observe and report.”
That sentiment makes San Francisco gun owner Chris Cheng furious. Cheng, who describes himself as a
Second Amendment advocate, has owned a gun since 2008 and said friends and strangers have been
reaching out to him about gun ownership in response to the attacks.
“I think a lot of Asian Americans are realizing that the police can only do so much and that the police are not
always there to protect us,” Cheng said. “They’re only there to take the report.”
Some law enforcement agencies have been trying to do more. Police departments in San Francisco and New
York City have set up task forces to focus on the issue and increased police presence in predominantly Asian
neighborhoods.

The 25 detectives on the NYPD’s all-Asian task force speak 11 languages among them. In July, when an
89-year-old woman whose face had been slapped and shirt set on fire didn’t initially cooperate with the
investigation, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, commanding officer of the task force, sent a detective who
speaks Cantonese to talk to her.
“She saw him, and it was like seeing her grandkids or something like that. She opened up,” Loo said. “The
details [she gave] were very precise, very clear. And from that interview, she was able to ID the people
that tried lighting her on fire, which led to an arrest.”
At least 18 people have been arrested in suspected hate crimes against Asian Americans in New York since
the attacks began in 2020, Loo said.
Many have placed blame for anti-Asian violence on former president Donald Trump, who repeatedly called
the coronavirus the “China virus” and “kung flu” during his time in office. The Anti-Defamation League
found that anti-Asian sentiment on Twitter spiked after Trump’s October covid-19 diagnosis. Even before
that, about a third of Americans in a survey released in April reported witnessing someone blame Asian
people for the pandemic.
But Rep. Mark Takano (DCalif.) says the problem runs deeper than the former president. During House
Democrats’ roundtable discussion on Feb. 19 about the attacks, Takano noted that “this sort of bias is
latent throughout American society, and it gets worse or less worse depending on the moment.”
As far back as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers from immigrating to the
United States, insidious ideas about Asian people’s influence have fueled racist sentiments in the country.
The act was a product of the “yellow peril,” a paranoia that Chinese immigrants were a threat to White
Americans’ jobs and other aspects of Western life.
These ideas carried into the 20th century, when Chinese American Vincent Chin was fatally beaten in
Detroit in 1982 after two men allegedly mistook him for Japanese, a group that was being blamed for the
decline of U.S. automakers. Chin’s assailants received a fine and probation for his death.
Tensions between Asian and Black communities also date back decades and have been reignited by videos
that show Black perpetrators in many of the recent attacks on Asian Americans. Those tensions are rooted
in the proximity in which the two underresourced communities often live and work, while “fighting for
crumbs,” said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice in
Washington.
That mutual suspicion has boiled over several times in recent history. In 1991, a Korean American
convenience store owner in Los Angeles accused 15-year-old Latasha Harlins of shoplifting before fatally
shooting her. The shopkeeper was convicted of voluntary manslaughter but served no jail time. A year
later, the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King set off riots in the city, during
which many Korean shops were burned and looted.
“There was a sense that the shopkeepers were not respectful of the Black clientele, didn’t trust the Black
clientele, and also overcharged the Black clientele,” said Brenda Stevenson, a history professor at UCLA
and author of “The Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the L.A. Riots.”
“On the other side, the Korean American shopkeepers at the time felt that the clientele were dangerous
and untrustworthy. Some of them had been assaulted, some had been killed.”
As the coronavirus pandemic has saddled low-income communities with economic hardships, community
callouts and social media posts seeking volunteers to help protect business owners and older residents
have proliferated in Asian American neighborhoods. The volunteer patrols pass out whistles so residents
can alert others to active crimes, and offer to walk with older neighbors as they run errands.

The Monterey County Board of Supervisors unanimously passed a resolution denouncing hate crimes and
rhetoric against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The move was made in response to the growing amount of hate crimes, harassment and discrimination that
Asian and Pacific Islander (API) Americans are facing, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
""When we document hate, when we go ahead and shine a light on an issue like this, we remind the generations
that come after us that we didn't stand for it at the time, that we spoke up, we said something,"" Supervisor
Chris Lopez said. ""That's critically important.""
In 2020, the Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate Reporting Center reported over 2,800 hate incidents
against API Americans. Physical assaults make up 9% of these incidents, while potential civil rights violations,
such as workplace discrimination, made up 8% of these incidents, according to the center's website.
The resolution states: ""The Monterey County Board of Supervisors, on behalf of the County and all residents
thereof, denounce hate crimes, hateful rhetoric and hateful acts against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,
and reaffirm our commitment to ensure that API Americans feel safe and welcome, both during this COVID-19
pandemic and beyond.""
Recent attacks were reported in Oakland and San Francisco, not far from Monterey County.

New York, March 14 -- Indian Americanhotel owners were shot during an argument with a guest at their New
Eastern Inn in Elkton, Maryland, in the US last week.
Usha and Dilip Patel, both 59, were shot last Friday (5) in the lobby following an argument with a guest,
possibly over payment, reports said.
Originally fromBharthana, Uttar Pradesh in India, Usha died and Dilip was wounded following the tragic incident,
Police said.
The guest Hakeem Evans, 26, of Newark, Delaware, had been staying at the hotel for a couple of days, said Lt.
Lawrence Waldridge with the Elkton Police Department.
According to reports, it is the latest example in a trend of violence toward hotel owners and Asian Americans.
The incident was caught on surveillance video.
At one point, police say, Evans put a gun between a plexiglass partition separating him from thePatelsand fired.
Usha was shot in the chest and Dilip was shot in the hip before the gun apparently jammed.
""Evans is then seen running back to his rented room and moments later, flees the area in a vehicle, which was
occupied by another person who is not identified at this time,"" according to a EPD press release.

In January, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old Thai man living with his family in San Francisco went out for his usual morning walk. A man attacked him by slamming into him.
The elderly man died of a brain haemorrhage a few days later.
Peng Wang, a Chinese academic in Southampton, England, was out jogging in February when he was assaulted by four white men who yelled at him to ""go home"" before punching
and kicking him. In Paris, a Japanese citizen was attacked by acid-throwing thugs.
The news these days is filled with upsetting stories like these, with equally discouraging statistics. Britain reported a 21 per cent increase in hate crimes against Asians last May
during the coronavirus crisis. In a recent survey, one in five Chinese-Australians say they have been a target of racially based attacks in the past year. And in the United States,
police departments and community groups are creating task forces to deal with a surge in racial attacks against Asians.
Like many Hongkongers reading about these terrible incidents, I am shocked and concerned about the recent surge in anti-Asian attacks, and I have been trying to come to an
understanding about why they are happening now. I know that anti-Asian racism is nothing new in modern history – certainly not in Western countries such as the US.
Here in Asia, we have had dark moments of racial strife – the violence against the Chinese community in Indonesia in 1998, and the racial discrimination faced by Koreans in Japan
come to mind.
What all these moments in history have in common is that they were sparked by economic and political tension. When countries are at odds, and economic times are tough, it is
easy to pin the blame on ""others"". People often become collateral damage.
In a world reeling from pandemic-related economic crises, people are looking for scapegoats. And China is an easy target, since Covid-19 was first reported in Wuhan. Last
October, a Pew Research Centre survey found that 73 per cent of Americans – and 81 per cent of Australians – have an unfavourable view of China. This offers a clue to why there
has been a recent surge of anti-Asian racist hate crimes. That Thais, Japanese and even Koreans have found themselves the target of anti-Chinese sentiment points to another
unfortunate racial issue that we Asians encounter in Western countries. Many Westerners cannot distinguish between, say, a Japanese or a Vietnamese. We are all ""Chinese"".
Here in Hong Kong, we are not without blame when it comes to racial bias. We should be doing more to support equal opportunity in our South Asian community. The Hong Kong
roots of ethnic Indians, Pakistanis and Nepalese families in many cases go back longer than that of recent arrivals in Hong Kong from the mainland. Yet many Hongkongers treat
them like foreigners.
On the other hand, in Hong Kong, we do have a strong bent towards meritocracy. Foreigners and Chinese alike come here for opportunities. Talent, not race, was the criteria for
the appointment of top Argentinian financier Nicolas Aguzin as head of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing.
Likewise, in the US, we are beginning to see the rise of an Asian-American meritocracy, with prominent members of the community becoming public figures and entering politics at
the highest level. Andrew Yang, of Chinese heritage, is a leading candidate for mayor of New York City. And the second-highest position in the country is held by Vice-President
Kamala Harris, who has South Asian roots.
These achievements give me hope that racial bias and hate crimes against Asians will become a rare thing. One way we can discourage racism is through education. The more you
learn about other peoples and cultures, the less likely you are to stereotype them all as dangerous ""others"".
Perhaps the most important way to combat these surges of racism is to support leaders who do not use race as a tactic to divide the public. Political and national tensions are a
fact of life. But when national leaders unjustly blame other countries, they are sowing bad seeds. And from those seeds grow bitter fruit such as the violence we are seeing in San
Francisco, Southampton and Paris.

Authorities are investigating a possible hate crime after a Willamette University student reported being pushed and kicked by two men in
downtown Salem while they allegedly made derogatory comments about her race.
The 21-year-old woman reported she was attacked at about noon Sunday on the corner of Capitol and Chemeketa streets while walking
to Safeway, according to Lt. Treven Upkes, a spokesperson with the Salem Police Department.
On Monday, Willamette University Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Dr. Lisa Landreman sent an email to the school
community about the incident. ""Today we were horrified to learn about a racially-motivated hate crime involving physical violence and
harassment, targeted at a Willamette student.""
University officials have not identified the student involved. But in the letter, Landreman commented on the rise in violence against Asian
American and Pacific Islander individuals since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It's important to acknowledge these crimes and for all members of our community to resist ill-informed, biased perspectives about
Asian people and to denounce this violence,"" she said.
The woman was approached by two men and pushed ""while derogatory comments were yelled at the student about their race,""
Landreman wrote.
The student fell to the ground and one of the suspects allegedly kicked her. She suffered minor injuries, officials said.
The student reported the incident to the Salem Police Department and Willamette University Campus Safety.
The first man is described as 5 feet 6 inches tall with a big build, long curly blond hair and facial hair. He was wearing a gray v-neck shirt
and black snow hat.
The second man is described as 5 feet 11 inches tall with a thin build and thin brown hair. He was wearing a button-down shirt and a
snow hat.
The two men could face second-degree bias crime and harassment charges, Upkes said. Police have not made any arrests.

Since the early months of COVID-19, people assumed to be Chinese have been stared at, yelled at, coughed on,
spit on, sprayed with Febreze, beaten, splashed with acid, pushed, stabbed, and murdered — for wearing
masks, for not wearing masks, for coughing, for sneezing, and sometimes for simply occupying public space. I
have thought twice about spending time in public on days when allergies to cats, pollen, or wildfire smoke might
make me susceptible to the hazards of ""coughing while Asian."" The anti-Asian violence was spurred on by
widespread rhetoric projecting blame for the COVID-19 pandemic onto China and people of Asian descent. But
the stigmatization of Chinese immigrants as a threat to public health and safety has a long history in the United
States. It emerges from an entrenched mode of racism that targets not only Chinese bodies, but Chinese air.
What do I mean by ""Chinese air""?
Answering that requires returning to the epidemic of violence that swept the West after Chinese immigrants
began settling in the U.S. in the 19th century. White Americans refused to live in proximity with Chinese
settlements — literally, they refused to breathe the same air. The consequences were deadly. A mob massacred
19 Chinese men in Los Angeles in 1871, and anti-Chinese race riots erupted in cities such as San Francisco,
Vancouver, and Seattle. Living on the periphery was no protection. As urban travelers in the West rode railroads
built by Chinese migrants to take in the pure air of nature resorts, more than 100 violent purges forced Chinese
immigrants out of rural settlements and into overcrowded, poorly ventilated accommodations in urban
Chinatowns.
At the time, many scientists didn't understand that microbes spread disease. Instead, they believed that illness

was transmitted through poisonous air or miasma and endorsed changes to urban planning and sanitation in
their efforts to sustain public health. Anti-Chinese agitators quickly adapted miasma theory as a tool in their
campaign.
Even after germ theory gained acceptance in the 1880s, they stigmatized Chinese air and smells, associating
overcrowded spaces, laboring bodies, opium smoke, culinary odors, and incense in several urban Chinatowns
with disease.
As the historian Nayan Shah has documented, 19th-century San Francisco public health officials regularly
blamed Chinatown for the city's recurring outbreaks of diseases including smallpox, tuberculosis, cholera, and
bubonic plague.
In response to the 1868 smallpox epidemic and working-class agitation against the Chinese, the city's Board of
Supervisors passed the Cubic Air Ordinance in 1870, requiring that dwellings contain at least 500 ""cubic feet of
air"" per adult resident.
This law was enforced exclusively against Chinese people, and critics noted that the city detained Chinese
immigrants in jails that were much more overcrowded than their homes. The Cubic Air Ordinance thus targeted
Chinese people not only as foreign bodies, but as deviant assemblages of bodies and air.
Sanitation became a common pretext for disciplining and displacing Chinese residents. In 1903, the physician
Woods Hutchinson praised San Francisco's health officials for adopting aggressive cleaning methods: ""The seven
and thirty separate smells of Chinatown have all been drowned in one grand olfactory delirium of chloride of
lime and carbolic acid. Never was Chinatown so free from vermin.""
Nevertheless, Hutchinson went on to declare that Chinatown ""can never be cleaned except by fire."" He may
have had in mind a fire that burned down 4,000 homes in Honolulu's Chinatown, permanently displacing many
residents — a conflagration that started when Honolulu's Board of Health burned down buildings to control an
outbreak of bubonic plague.
Hutchinson's fantasy for San Francisco nearly came true in 1906. In the wake of the city's devastating
earthquake and fire, officials proposed relocating its Chinese community from the burned-out but centrally
located Chinatown to far-flung Hunter's Point. This plan, which was eventually stopped after intervention from
China's consul-general, presumed that the Chinese community would not be out of place amid the latter
neighborhood's slaughterhouses and industrial fumes.
On a smaller scale, American nuisance charges have also posited Chinese air as an offense to public well-being.
In the 1880s, complaints about the smell of drying squid shut down a thriving Chinese community of squid
fishermen in Monterey, California. More recently, similar protests have been lodged against Asian restaurants
and food manufacturers, including the Sriracha sauce factory in Irwindale, California.
In a 1999 case in Pennsylvania, grease smells from Wok's Chinese Restaurant were deemed ""noxious"" even
though, the defendant noted, they were comparable to the smell of burning wood from a nearby pizza
restaurant.
The notion of Chinese miasmas has had support from respected academics. In the 1890 essay ""Mongolianism in
America,"" the historian and ethnologist Hubert Howe Bancroft (for whom UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library is
named) wrote that he found it difficult to breathe when he walked through the crowded alleys of San Francisco's
Chinatown. ""Faces swarm at every door, inhaling poison, exhaling worse,"" he claimed. Bancroft never considered
that he might be experiencing anxiety, triggered by his own discomfort with something unfamiliar.
Instead, he speculated ""whether a Chinaman's lungs are not formed on a different principle from ours ... He
certainly seems to thrive in stench where others would suffocate."" Attributing Chinatown's poor air quality to

cultural and biological differences, so-called experts like Bancroft drew attention away from the forces of mob
violence, poverty, social marginalization, and housing inequity that had pushed Chinese immigrants into
substandard living conditions.
Because culture plays a powerful role in shaping olfactory responses, I have been studying how American
narratives spread — and sometimes challenge — these ideas about Chinese air. Stories about Chinese stench
date back to the first decades of Chinese immigration. In the 1860s, Mark Twain wrote about a San Francisco
detective who could smell a chicken feather from a crime scene and ""tell which block in Sacramento street the
Chinaman lives in who committed it.""
The Yellow Peril has a smell in Frank Norris's novel Moran of the Lady Letty, in which a white woman is held
captive by a crew of reeking Chinese pirates. In Sax Rohmer's The Insidious Fu Manchu, published in 1913,
the first Asiatic supervillain attacks detectives with a mysterious poison gas, which leaves ""no clew-remaining
— except the smell."" By the time Raymond Chandler wrote that a character ""had a sort of dry musty smell,
like a fairly clean Chinaman,"" ""Chinese"" had become a metaphor for stench.
Edith Maude Eaton, a mixed-race Canadian writer of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who has been
called the mother of Asian American literature, fought this pattern of olfactory stereotyping in her stories
about domestic life in several urban Chinatowns. Writing under the pen-name Sui Sin Far (""Chinese water
flower"") and titling her book Mrs. Spring Fragrance, she associated Chinese immigrants with pleasant smells.
When they could afford to, Eaton suggested, Chinese immigrants preferred a cool and fragrant atmosphere:
""After the heat and dust and unsavoriness of the highways and byways of Chinatown, the young reporter who
had been sent to find a story, had stepped across the threshold of a cool, deep room, fragrant with the odor
of dried lilies and sandalwood, and found Pan.""
Where the natural aromas of lilies and sandalwood indicate the careful housekeeping of the Chinese family,
the smell of the streets was the result of the city's failure — or refusal — to fulfill its responsibility of cleaning
Chinatown's streets.
The contemporary artist Anicka Yi took a more direct approach to olfactory racism in her 2017 Guggenheim
Museum exhibition, Life is Cheap. The first installation consisted of three gas canisters emitting a blend of
odors sourced from both a colony of ants and from Manhattan's Chinatown and Koreatown.
The main gallery featured two dioramas Yi created by using visually captivating bacterial cultures sourced
from the same neighborhoods, and the same colony of ants inhabiting an enlarged circuit board. The piece is
a meditation on Asian stereotypes and Western dependence on inexpensive Asian imports.
Not unlike Fu Manchu's gas attack, the scents Yi works with — which she describes as vegetal, floral, citrusy,
and meaty — insidiously penetrate the bodies of visitors. But the museum setting recasts the smells of Asian
neighborhoods as an unusual olfactory experience, something to be sought after rather than avoided. Yi hints
that inhaling the scents of Chinatown, Koreatown, and ants might predispose her audience to perceive their
connections with the beautiful forms presented in her living dioramas.
Life is Cheap asks how smells usually thought of as foreign are already part of us, whether as bacteria
inhabiting our bodies or as fumes emitted in the course of producing our computers and phones. After all,
China's industry and urban development are intimately connected with the U.S. addiction to cheap
technology.
And, like the perceived unsavoriness of Chinatown streets, the conditions that promote COVID-19 are part of
something much bigger than a wet market in Wuhan. Chinese air is not made in China, it is an exhalation of
the global economy.

A new study revealed hate crimes against Asian Americans spiked almost 150% throughout 2020, a year
ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic that is speculated to have fueled some of the violence after the virus was
first discovered in China.
An analysis released by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San
Bernardino, looked into hate crimes in 16 of the country's biggest cities and how they compared from 2019 to
2020.

In New York City, the study found crimes targeting Asian Americans went up 833%. Around 14.5% of the city is
part of the Asian American community. Philadelphia and Cleveland both went up 200%, while Los Angeles went
up by 114%.
The first spike in anti-Asian hate crimes started in March and April of last year, when the pandemic began to
send the country into lockdown. In March, the FBI warned of an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans
in light of COVID-19.

An elderly Asian woman is said to have pummeled a man and sent him to the hospital after he attacked her
without provocation in San Francisco on Wednesday.
The 79-year-old woman, who has not been publicly named, beat an unidentified man who attacked her until he
was bloodied, witnesses told KPIX 5. Video of the incident showed a crowd of people gathered around the
woman as she held an ice pack to a gash on her face and yelled in Chinese at the suspected attacker, who was
handcuffed to a stretcher.
“You bum, why did you bully me?” the woman yelled in Chinese.
“This bum, he bullied me,” she continued while facing the crowd. “He bullied me, this bum.""
The attacker, who was said to be 39 years old, was arrested after he assaulted an 83-year-old Asian male and
fled on foot, the San Francisco Police Department told the Washington Examiner in an email. He struck the 79-
year-old woman while fleeing a security guard who witnessed the first attack and was later detained, SFPD
added.
Both of the Asian victims were transported to a local hospital after the elderly woman told bystanders the man
punched her without provocation as she leaned against a light pole. The suspect, however, was ""transported to a
local hospital for an unrelated, prior medical condition,"" police said.

The man accused of killing eight people at three different Atlanta-area spas this week has been charged.
Robert Aaron Long, 21, was charged with four counts of murder and one count of aggravated assault in the
shooting and has no bond, according to the Atlanta police department.
EIGHT DEAD IN SHOOTINGS AT THREE ATLANTA-AREA MASSAGE PARLORS
He allegedly shot and killed at least four people and injured one when he opened fire at the Young’s Asian
Massage Parlor around 5:00 p.m. About an hour later, police were dispatched to the Gold Spa and Aroma
Therapy Spa, where four more dead victims were found. These spas are across the street from one another, just
south of Interstate 85. Seven of the victims were women.
Six of the eight victims were also reportedly Asian, leading many to suspect a hate crime, given an increase in
hate crimes against the Asian American community since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, however, the
alleged shooter claimed that was false.
On Wednesday, police released the names of the four people who were killed at the Young's Asian Massage
Parlor: Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33; Paul Andre Michels, 54; Xiaojie Yan, 49; and Daoyou Feng, 44. Elcias R.
Hernandez-Ortiz, 30, was identified by police as the person injured during the shooting.

202003,"
It's been about a year since Ellen Hartman took a walk with her husband and two young daughters along the Susquehanna riverfront in
Harrisburg, trying to get some fresh air and a respite amid a brewing pandemic.
She found little peace. Hartman, the senior vice president of the Central PA Korean Association, said she was accosted during the walk
by four young men shouting at her.
""There were a group of four males who began taunting me, yelling, calling me the coronavirus, throwing their arms towards me,"" she
said.
Because she had her 3-year-old daughter with her, Hartman said she didn't want to react.
""You could tell these four males are very angry and in their tone profanities, and my 3 year old was waving at them. She thought, 'oh
look, they're saying hello to me,'"" she said.
Hartman didn't report the incident to the police or state officials. Instead, she reported it to the Community Responders Network, a
grassroots coalition that works to reduce bias incidents in central Pennsylvania.
Her account was the third report on a list of 33 for 2020. The first report describes an unknown man in a pickup truck driving past an
Asian American Dickinson College student and yelling, blaming her for the coronavirus.
That was last March, when there were less than 50 reported cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. Since then, the virus and
discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have grown in the state.
While the Community Responders Network has tallied at least 33 incidents, Chad Lassiter, the executive director of the Pennsylvania
Human Relations Commission, is reluctant to quote a figure, but recognized there has been an increase.
""We've seen an uptick throughout the state. It's challenging to gather numbers. Often times, these incidents go unreported or
underreported,"" he said.
For example, Hartman did not report her case to the state Human Relations Commission.

The uptick in Pennsylvania is in line with what's happening nationally:
The New York Police Department reported a 1,900% increase in reported hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020.
Almost daily reports from the Bay Area of California show an increase in violence against Asian Americans, particularly elderly Asian
Americans.
Stop AAPI Hate, a database that has tracked racial violence during the coronavirus, received more than 2,800 reports of anti-Asian
discrimination from March through the end of December.
A rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans
Discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders continue to be reported this year.
Shortly after taking office in January, President Joe Biden signed an executive order Jan. 26, condemning racism, xenophobia and
intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The order also instructed the COVID-19 Health Equity Task Force to issue guidance and best practices for advancing cultural
competency, language access and sensitivity towards Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
Biden also asked the U.S. Attorney General's Office to expand the collection of data and public reporting regarding hate incidents
against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
On Feb. 22, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf's Advisory Commission on Asian Pacific American Affairs condemned recent attacks on Asian
Pacific Americans across the country and called for all Pennsylvanians to stand up against anti-Asian hate and racism in all forms.
""From Oakland, California to Brooklyn, New York, innocent Asian elders have been severely injured or killed in wanton acts of violence.
Here in Pennsylvania, witnesses have reported more insidious forms of hate, including threats of bodily harm to Asian American high
school students and the casual use of the term ""COVID"" to name Asian-influenced food,"" a statement from the governor's office said.
But discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is not a new problem. It's an injustice that has been pervasive for
decades.
Reporting and documenting
Hartman said she has experienced racist hate crimes since childhood. Growing up outside Philadelphia, her family's house was tarred
with swastikas, a brick was thrown through her sister's window, and an attempt was even made to blow up her father's car.
But the perpetrators never faced justice, she said.
Now that hate crimes and racism against Asian-Americans and Pacific Islanders are getting more attention, Hartman and other Asian-
Americans in Central Pennsylvania point to some recent generators of bigotry.
That includes disinformation surrounding the coronavirus and the words of former President Donald Trump, who called COVID-19 ""the
China virus"" and ""kung flu"" during his 2020 campaign stops in Pennsylvania and throughout his nationally televised speeches.
Hartman said the actions of Trump created an environment where scapegoating is permitted, accusing the former president of ""reducing
us to the virus, dehumanizing us, and using phrases like 'the China virus' and the 'kung flu.'
""There is that stereotype, you know, the ""kung flu,"" said Joseph Romanoff, who is biracial and teaches Zumba classes at the New York
Fitness Club in Lebanon and whose mother came to the U.S. from the Philippines.
""But (this has) been going on for a long time. It's not in our heads.""
The difference, he said, is that now, ""racist attacks are being recorded and documented on social media.""
State Rep. Patty Kim, D-Dauphin County, has served the 103rd district since 2013 and is a former Harrisburg city councilwoman. She
said she has been concerned that many hateful incidents against Asian-Americans were going unreported.
""Growing up, I've had kids calling me names and pointing out I'm different. I thought that was the way of life,"" Kim said. ""People feel
very bad and embarrassed, and just want it to go away.""
""I want to encourage people of any race when you hear these kinds of comments and actions they should be reported and documented
to the Human Relations Commission and PA Attorney General,"" she said.

Kim said she's glad more people are taking notice of discrimination against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
""We need a culture shift. We don't need to tolerate this,"" she said.
Rural racism
Although a lot of the recent coverage has concentrated on cities such as San Francisco and New York, in more rural areas, this
dynamic can often be worse.
""Moving from Philadelphia to Central PA, I've experienced more microaggressions, more bias, more hate,"" Hartman said, recalling
being asked to leave a party where a Confederate flag was being displayed and being shouted at with racist epithets while drinking a
milkshake at the Pennsylvania Farm Show.
As a leader at the Central PA Korean Association, Hartman said organizations like hers could help connect people that may have never
met an Asian-American person before.
""There are individuals who have gone their entire life not having a close friend or a colleague who's Asian, and all they're hearing is
about Asian-Americans being viruses, or the carriers of disease, or invaders, or taking jobs away,"" she said.
""In smaller, rural towns that are predominantly one race, one culture, maybe you don't have other cultures coming in....I think
there's so many opportunities in this globally networked world to break from that.""
The bigotry can take on both overt and less obvious characters, particularly surrounding the coronavirus.
""You see people walk away from us in the grocery store,"" Kim said. ""It's hard to prove, it's subtle, but I believe it's happening....I've
experienced that a couple times but don't know what they were thinking of.""
Kim said that larger cities with more diversity were able to pick up on patterns of racism more quickly.
Hartman said she was the only teacher of color when teaching at high schools in Central Pennsylvania and experienced
microaggressions.
Romanoff said his mother had also been subject to racial bigotry from students at Central Pennsylvania schools when she was a
teacher, with students telling her to ""go back to China"" and mimicking slanted eyes.
His mother came as a chemist, but there is a false belief that Asian immigrants are taking jobs, he said.
""A lot of Filipinos feel like they have to dumb down their resumes just to get hired,"" he added.
Romanoff said he was harassed as a kid by people saying he would be deported if an election was won by Ross Perot, a former
business executive who mounted two third-party presidential bids on anti-free trade and nativist themes in the 1990s.
""It makes me sick,"" Romanoff said. ""America is supposed to be a country of freedom. But we have to be honest with ourselves.""
If you see a hate crime occur, call 9-1-1. Non-emergency hate crimes and discriminatory acts should be reported to state and local
police, the FBI, the Governor's Office of Homeland Security, or the Pennsylvania Human Relations Commission. For more information

America’s long history of hatred and violence against Asians reared its ugly head once again with the recent
tragedy in Atlanta where 8 women, 6 of them Asian were massacred by a racism-motivated young
White man wielding a weapon of war that he had just bought.
The killings marked the dreadful pandemic year as one of intense and misplaced anti-Asian racism in the U.S.
According to an advocacy group “Stop AAPI Hate” there have been more than 3800 incidents involving
reported involving discrimination and violence targeted at Asian people in the past year alone.
Op-Ed: Hate crimes against Asians are un-American.

Many more had not been reported. A coalition of civil rights groups estimated more than 2,100 incidents.
In Midland, Texas an Asian family including two young children were stabbed at a Sam’s. The assailant was
captured and said he stabbed them because he thought they were spreading Coronavirus. The Asian family
was not even Chinese.
A Filipina nurse tearfully reported that after working 18 hours straight in a hospital’s emergency room, she
stopped at a grocery store to buy some essentials and was greeted by a couple of old ladies shouting anti-
Asian slurs. The Filipina nurse is fair-skinned with Chinese facial features.
Closer to home, a diminutive 77-year-old Filipina who is a charter board member of the Philippine American
Chamber of Commerce in North Texas was denied service at a local QT grocery store and was given the dirty
look by the clerk who was mumbling racist words.
The feisty senior citizen who is a martial arts aficionada held her ground and was ready for anything untoward.
It was her burly and outspoken
American husband who confronted the clerk and strongly put him in his place.
Meanwhile, a story went viral about a 75-year-old Chinese woman in San Francisco who fought back and sent
her assailant to the hospital.
Stories circulated around New Year 2021, some captured on video, about elderly Filipinos and other Asians
actually being assaulted on San Francisco and New York streets.
A 91-year-old Thai retiree in Oakland was assaulted during his morning walk and killed. A Filipino’s face was
slashed in a subway station. All for no
reason except a mistaken belief that the Chinese brought COVID-19 to the U.S. And it didn’t matter that many
of those assaulted were not even Chinese.
Is this American enough?
It also didn’t matter if the victims of anti-Asian hatred were born and raised in the U.S. and served heroically
in the military. CNN showed 78-year-old Lee Wong, a war veteran and Purple Heart recipient who came to the
U.S. as a child, giving an impassioned speech in a town hall meeting. He tearfully
shared that when people looked at him with accusing eyes, he told them he is an American.
And some would say “You are not American enough, you are not patriotic enough!” So, at the town hall
meeting he took off his shirt and showed everyone the scars that covered his entire body caused by 6 enemy
bullets that pierced his body during the Vietnam War. And he declared: “Is this American enough?” “Is this
patriotic enough?”
Asian Americans do not deserve the xenophobic and bigoted attacks against them that are spiking in America,
falsely attributing to them the origin and meteoric spread of Coronavirus. Asian Americans are also
victims of the pandemic. And hundreds of thousands of Asian American medical professionals and hospital
workers who risk their own lives saving COVID-19 victims are heroes who deserve to be thanked and
congratulated, not hated.
The “Model Silent Minority Community”, discriminated for a century, now lives in fear
There are 575,000 Asian businesses in the U.S. that feel threatened. The scapegoating is
reminiscent of old racist tropes that led to the discrimination of Asian immigrants in the U.S. – from
the quarantining of San Francisco’s Chinatown during the bubonic plague of the 1900s, to the

rounding up of Japanese Americans in internment camps during WWII, to the traditional
discrimination in visa quota allocation against Asians by the U.S. Immigration Service over the
years.
It did not help that historically, hardworking Asians have been the subject of scorn and jealousy as
America’s “silent model minority community” with the highest per capita income and the highest
education level in the U.S. among immigrant groups and the least chances of getting into trouble
with the law.
Asian-Americans are builders, not destroyers
A former President of the United States once said that if Asian American doctors and nurses
(particularly Filipinos, Indians, Chinese and Korean) would leave the country, the entire American
health system will collapse.
Unbeknownst to many mainstream Americans especially the younger generations, Asian Americans
have played a significant role in the building of this country and to its supremacy as the most
economically powerful nation on earth.
Notable Americans of Asian descent have been responsible for the country’s global leadership in
high technology and modern sciences. Among these are the Asian-American CEOs or cofounders of
Fortune 500 companies such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Master Card, You Tube, Hotmail,
NVidia, FitBit, Adobe, Pepsico and many others. It was also an Asian American scientist who
discovered the cure for the Ebola virus and is busy at work on potential cure for COVID-19.
Asian Americans are typically soft-spoken and humble to a fault. The many thousands of Asian
medical professionals will never flaunt their own personal sacrifices as front-liners and willing
warriors in the war against the deadly Coronavirus. Asian business and technical professionals
such as
engineers, scientists, architects, accountants, educators and others are low-keyed as they lead the
technology revolution in the country.
They should all be applauded and thanked, instead of being shunned and
mistreated by clueless and ungrateful segments of our society. And it is wrong to curb the
immigration into this country of these skilled and talented professionals. America must continue to
be open to Asian immigration, especially the highly-skilled professionals. America and all of us will
be better for it.

As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the state and the country last year, the number of anti-Asian bias incidents —
which includes shunning, racial slurs and physical attacks — went up by nearly 75% within the past year, data released by
the New Jersey State Police show.
COVID-19's origin in Wuhan, China, has caused a significant backlash against Asian Americans across the United States for
the past year and New Jersey has seen its fair share of discrimination toward Asian Americans, said U.S. Rep. Andy Kim,
an Asian American Democrat representing New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District.
Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic did not start this new trend of discrimination toward the Asian American community,
but rather gave people an ""excuse"" to target them and highlights the long history of bigotry against them.
""I believe those statistics are being under-reported and that discrimination against Asian Americans in our country existed
far before COVID-19 and it will last after COVID-19,"" Kim said.

Anti-Asian bias reports, which involve Asian or Pacific Islander individuals, jumped 74%, from 39 in 2019 to 68 in 2020
across the state, according to preliminary data compiled from the New Jersey State Police. However, these statistics are
based off what is only reported to police, as experts and officials believe there are more cases that go underreported.
""I am terrified,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and a Shanghai native who lives in
Cherry Hill. ""I think a lot of my friends feel the same way, you know, is this safe anymore? Yes, a lot of these attacks you
see happening in the city, but if it doesn't stop, is it going to happen tomorrow or a year down the road in the suburbs?""
Here is a breakdown of reported bias incidents against Asian Americans by county across New Jersey:
Bergen: 14
Burlington: 1
Camden: 2
Essex: 1
Gloucester: 1
Hudson: 4
Mercer: 7
Middlesex: 14
Monmouth: 10
Morris: 1
Passaic: 2
Somerset: 5
Sussex: 1
Union: 3
Warren: 1
Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Ocean, and Salem counties did not see any incidents of bias against Asian
Americans over the past year, according to New Jersey State Police. The report did not specify type of incident by county.
Asian Americans reside in all 21 counties and in every part of the state. There are approximately 960,000 Asian American
residents, or 10% of the total New Jersey population.
The number of reported incidents seem to track by population: In Middlesex County, about 25% of the total county
population is Asian American as of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bergen has an Asian population of 16%,
while Hudson, Somerset, Mercer and Monmouth have populations of more than 10%.
Across New Jersey, bias incidents among all groups — not just Asian American and Pacific Islanders — involving aggravated
assault rose by 18% from 2019 to 2020. Incidents involving a tactic of intimidation rose by 7.5%, while terroristic threats
skyrocketed by more than 103% from 32 reports in 2019 to 65 made in 2020.
The State Police report also detailed an increase in incidents targeting Black, Latino and LGBTQ communities, showing that
incidents of harassment and discrimination rose for the second straight year. In 2020, New Jersey recorded 1,441 bias
incidents, which was the highest total ever recorded and a 45% increase from 2019's total.
But nothing stood out more than incidents involving harassment, as New Jersey saw an increase of more than 72% in this
category — 421 in 2019 and then up to 726 incidents in 2020. Additionally, ""other"" forms of bias incidents, which includes
desecration of venerated objects, significantly rose by more than 278%, from 34 to 129 this past year.
For all race groups across New Jersey, simple assaults fell by about 4%, while bias incidents involving destruction, damage
or vandalism to one's property fell by 3.5%, according to the annual report.

Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate (Stop AAPI Hate), a nonprofit organization in California, recorded 3,795 incidents
of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States — a 26% increase from the prior year's 2,808 incidents. Some 42% of
the incidents were reported by Chinese Americans.
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were all in the top 10 for most reported incidents, the group's data showed.
Between March 19, 2020, through Feb. 28 of this year, shows that more than 500 incidents took place so far.
Below is a breakdown of the top 10 states with highest number of bias incidents against Asian Americans over the past
year, according to Stop AAPI Hate's report:
California: 1,691
New York: 517
Washington: 158
Texas: 103
Pennsylvania: 97
Massachusetts: 96
Illinois: 92
Florida: 59
New Jersey: 59
Maryland: 51
The most common types of discrimination involved harassment and shunning, which made up 68% and 20.5% of the
group's reports.
Physical assault was the third-most common category, making up 11% of the total incidents across the country. A quarter
of the incidents took place on public streets, while a third of the incidents occurred at businesses.
""I think the (COVID-19) pandemic and, the discrimination that we've seen, has been pouring gasoline on the fire over the
last year,"" Kim said. ""It's disturbing and I truly also believe that these numbers do not reflect the totality of what is going
on.""
COVID-19's impact
Asian history experts say the issue of harassment is nothing new for the Asian community, as a majority have dealt with
discrimination for decades. But there have been several high-profile incidents, such as the recent shootings in Atlanta-area
spas on March 16, in which six of the eight victims were Asian women, that have played a large part in highlighting the
issue.
Last March, a New York City man attacked a 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight and hurled anti-Asian
insults at her as she walked down a midtown Manhattan street, according to New York City police.
The woman was later hospitalized with serious injuries after the attacker punched, kicked and stomped on her as staff and
bystanders did not intervene the incident. NYPD called the incident ""a hate crime assault,"" which later prompted a large
outcry amongst the Asian community for justice and change.
Earlier this month, Jonathan Russo, 27, was charged with multiple counts of assault and harassment, both as a hate crime,
in connection with pushing a 64-year-old Asian American woman on a sidewalk and knocking her down in New York,
assaulting a 32-year-old Asian American woman by grabbing her hair, and shoving a 77-year-old Asian American man to
the ground.
Richard Chen, 40, a web producer and a board member for the Asian American Action Fund, said anti-Asian discrimination
is nothing new across the tristate area, saying that even though he would often see people staring at him when the
pandemic first started, he believes many others have had it far worse in years past.

""Discrimination toward (Asians) has always been there, especially in New York,"" said Chen, a resident from Branchburg in
Somerset County. ""Sure, we usually get those typical stares because of where the virus started, but those who have been
harassed or assaulted because of it is completely unacceptable and is likely going to continue to be honest.""
Jennifer Ho, a professor of Asian American studies at University Colorado of Boulder and the director of Humanities and
Arts, said this topic is the story of the moment, and that the pandemic has only given people another reason to attack this
community.
Ho emphasized the recent violent attacks at Asian American seniors and women throughout the first few months of this
year, specifically videos that have surfaced across the mainstream media, has likely led to the increase of reports recorded
by the Stop AAPI Hate nonprofit organization.
""I want to say that with the violence we're seeing now and with all the racism and the videos that came out last year
against African Americans, the reports are increasing because of the national attention it is receiving,"" Ho said.
""Prior to this year, when was the last time you honestly saw this much attention on racism against Asian Americans?""
Additionally, the report released by the AAPI anti-hate organization also showed that Asian women made up 68% of the
total incidents, compared with men, who made up 29% of all incidents recorded.
In the Stop AAPI Hate report, victims of anti-Asian harassment sent in their stories to the organization, which included one
Filipino American woman reporting that while in a Washington, D.C., metro station with her boyfriend, an unknown man
shouted at her ""Chinese b----,"" then proceeded to cough at the couple and physically threaten them.
It didn't begin with the pandemic
In 1871 in Los Angeles, around 500 white and Hispanic people murdered 19 Chinese residents in the so-called Chinese
massacre — a buildup of a growing anti-Asian culture that played a part in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which
banned the immigration of Chinese laborers. It was the nation's first set of immigration laws to ban individuals based on
race.
Japan's bombing on Pearl Harbor in 1941 resulted in the internment of most Japanese Americans across the West Coast to
barracks and camps in remote areas during World War II, with the federal government deeming them a possibly disloyal
security risk. Over 127,000 Japanese Americans were placed in camps in the United States during the war and over 1,800
died in the camps.
Jason Oliver-Chang, a professor at the University of Connecticut whose research focuses on Asian American studies and
American immigration history, said Asian Americans were used as a racial wedge after World War II and the Vietnam War.
""Japanese Americans were used as a racial wedge in the '40s and '50s, as with an American allied victory in World War II,
there was then a need to claim victory at home as well,"" Oliver-Chang said. ""People at this time were arguing to fight
fascism abroad and fascism at home and in some respects, people looked to the recovery of Japanese Americans from the
incarceration experience during World War II, as evidence of the United States overcoming the color line.""
Oliver-Chang said even though the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s played a major step in overcoming the racial
barriers in the United States, Asian American voices still did not receive as much attention.
""I think it helps to explain some of the absence of Asian American voices during these time periods because Asian
Americans were drawing from the harsh treatment and atrocities happening in Japan, Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, to
inform others of their own treatment in the United States,"" Oliver-Chang said.
Congressman Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, said he has also had his fair share of experiences with racism and
discrimination, but is more concerned about how much longer this issue will continue.
""There are a number of instances that really stick out, but I think what Asian Americans often feel is just this perpetual and
constant and rhythmic erosion of belonging that takes its toll,"" Kim said. ""I think it worries me and others, not just about
how we get through this moment and are we safe, but where are we heading as a country in this direction.""
What's being done
Experts and advocates agree the rise in Asian American attacks in 2020 became more prevalent after President Donald
Trump began to routinely refer to the COVID-19 pandemic as the ""China virus.""

Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic did not start this new trend of discrimination toward the Asian American community,
but rather gave people an ""excuse"" to target them and highlights the long history of bigotry against them.
""I believe those statistics are being under-reported and that discrimination against Asian Americans in our country existed
far before COVID-19 and it will last after COVID-19,"" Kim said.

Anti-Asian bias reports, which involve Asian or Pacific Islander individuals, jumped 74%, from 39 in 2019 to 68 in 2020
across the state, according to preliminary data compiled from the New Jersey State Police. However, these statistics are
based off what is only reported to police, as experts and officials believe there are more cases that go underreported.
""I am terrified,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and a Shanghai native who lives in
Cherry Hill. ""I think a lot of my friends feel the same way, you know, is this safe anymore? Yes, a lot of these attacks you see
happening in the city, but if it doesn't stop, is it going to happen tomorrow or a year down the road in the suburbs?""
Here is a breakdown of reported bias incidents against Asian Americans by county across New Jersey:
Bergen: 14
Burlington: 1
Camden: 2
Essex: 1
Gloucester: 1
Hudson: 4
Mercer: 7
Middlesex: 14
Monmouth: 10
Morris: 1
Passaic: 2
Somerset: 5
Sussex: 1
Union: 3
Warren: 1
Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Ocean, and Salem counties did not see any incidents of bias against Asian
Americans over the past year, according to New Jersey State Police. The report did not specify type of incident by county.
Asian Americans reside in all 21 counties and in every part of the state. There are approximately 960,000 Asian American
residents, or 10% of the total New Jersey population.
The number of reported incidents seem to track by population: In Middlesex County, about 25% of the total county
population is Asian American as of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bergen has an Asian population of 16%,
while Hudson, Somerset, Mercer and Monmouth have populations of more than 10%.
Across New Jersey, bias incidents among all groups — not just Asian American and Pacific Islanders — involving aggravated
assault rose by 18% from 2019 to 2020. Incidents involving a tactic of intimidation rose by 7.5%, while terroristic threats
skyrocketed by more than 103% from 32 reports in 2019 to 65 made in 2020.
The State Police report also detailed an increase in incidents targeting Black, Latino and LGBTQ communities, showing that
incidents of harassment and discrimination rose for the second straight year. In 2020, New Jersey recorded 1,441 bias
incidents, which was the highest total ever recorded and a 45% increase from 2019's total.
But nothing stood out more than incidents involving harassment, as New Jersey saw an increase of more than 72% in this
category — 421 in 2019 and then up to 726 incidents in 2020. Additionally, ""other"" forms of bias incidents, which includes
desecration of venerated objects, significantly rose by more than 278%, from 34 to 129 this past year.
For all race groups across New Jersey, simple assaults fell by about 4%, while bias incidents involving destruction, damage or
vandalism to one's property fell by 3.5%, according to the annual report.

Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate (Stop AAPI Hate), a nonprofit organization in California, recorded 3,795 incidents
of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States — a 26% increase from the prior year's 2,808 incidents. Some 42% of
the incidents were reported by Chinese Americans.
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were all in the top 10 for most reported incidents, the group's data showed.
Between March 19, 2020, through Feb. 28 of this year, shows that more than 500 incidents took place so far.
Below is a breakdown of the top 10 states with highest number of bias incidents against Asian Americans over the past year,
according to Stop AAPI Hate's report:
California: 1,691
New York: 517
Washington: 158
Texas: 103
Pennsylvania: 97
Massachusetts: 96
Illinois: 92
Florida: 59
New Jersey: 59
Maryland: 51
The most common types of discrimination involved harassment and shunning, which made up 68% and 20.5% of the group's
reports.
Physical assault was the third-most common category, making up 11% of the total incidents across the country. A quarter of
the incidents took place on public streets, while a third of the incidents occurred at businesses.
""I think the (COVID-19) pandemic and, the discrimination that we've seen, has been pouring gasoline on the fire over the
last year,"" Kim said. ""It's disturbing and I truly also believe that these numbers do not reflect the totality of what is going
on.""
COVID-19's impact
Asian history experts say the issue of harassment is nothing new for the Asian community, as a majority have dealt with
discrimination for decades. But there have been several high-profile incidents, such as the recent shootings in Atlanta-area
spas on March 16, in which six of the eight victims were Asian women, that have played a large part in highlighting the
issue.
Last March, a New York City man attacked a 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight and hurled anti-Asian
insults at her as she walked down a midtown Manhattan street, according to New York City police.
The woman was later hospitalized with serious injuries after the attacker punched, kicked and stomped on her as staff and
bystanders did not intervene the incident. NYPD called the incident ""a hate crime assault,"" which later prompted a large
outcry amongst the Asian community for justice and change.
Earlier this month, Jonathan Russo, 27, was charged with multiple counts of assault and harassment, both as a hate crime,
in connection with pushing a 64-year-old Asian American woman on a sidewalk and knocking her down in New York,
assaulting a 32-year-old Asian American woman by grabbing her hair, and shoving a 77-year-old Asian American man to the
ground.
Richard Chen, 40, a web producer and a board member for the Asian American Action Fund, said anti-Asian discrimination is
nothing new across the tristate area, saying that even though he would often see people staring at him when the pandemic
first started, he believes many others have had it far worse in years past.

""Discrimination toward (Asians) has always been there, especially in New York,"" said Chen, a resident from Branchburg in
Somerset County. ""Sure, we usually get those typical stares because of where the virus started, but those who have been
harassed or assaulted because of it is completely unacceptable and is likely going to continue to be honest.""
Jennifer Ho, a professor of Asian American studies at University Colorado of Boulder and the director of Humanities and Arts,
said this topic is the story of the moment, and that the pandemic has only given people another reason to attack this
community.
Ho emphasized the recent violent attacks at Asian American seniors and women throughout the first few months of this year,
specifically videos that have surfaced across the mainstream media, has likely led to the increase of reports recorded by the
Stop AAPI Hate nonprofit organization.
""I want to say that with the violence we're seeing now and with all the racism and the videos that came out last year against
African Americans, the reports are increasing because of the national attention it is receiving,"" Ho said. ""Prior to this year,
when was the last time you honestly saw this much attention on racism against Asian Americans?""
Additionally, the report released by the AAPI anti-hate organization also showed that Asian women made up 68% of the total
incidents, compared with men, who made up 29% of all incidents recorded.
In the Stop AAPI Hate report, victims of anti-Asian harassment sent in their stories to the organization, which included one
Filipino American woman reporting that while in a Washington, D.C., metro station with her boyfriend, an unknown man
shouted at her ""Chinese b----,"" then proceeded to cough at the couple and physically threaten them.
It didn't begin with the pandemic
In 1871 in Los Angeles, around 500 white and Hispanic people murdered 19 Chinese residents in the so-called Chinese
massacre — a buildup of a growing anti-Asian culture that played a part in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned
the immigration of Chinese laborers. It was the nation's first set of immigration laws to ban individuals based on race.
Japan's bombing on Pearl Harbor in 1941 resulted in the internment of most Japanese Americans across the West Coast to
barracks and camps in remote areas during World War II, with the federal government deeming them a possibly disloyal
security risk. Over 127,000 Japanese Americans were placed in camps in the United States during the war and over 1,800
died in the camps.
Jason Oliver-Chang, a professor at the University of Connecticut whose research focuses on Asian American studies and
American immigration history, said Asian Americans were used as a racial wedge after World War II and the Vietnam War.
""Japanese Americans were used as a racial wedge in the '40s and '50s, as with an American allied victory in World War II,
there was then a need to claim victory at home as well,"" Oliver-Chang said. ""People at this time were arguing to fight
fascism abroad and fascism at home and in some respects, people looked to the recovery of Japanese Americans from the
incarceration experience during World War II, as evidence of the United States overcoming the color line.""
Oliver-Chang said even though the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s played a major step in overcoming the racial barriers
in the United States, Asian American voices still did not receive as much attention.
""I think it helps to explain some of the absence of Asian American voices during these time periods because Asian Americans
were drawing from the harsh treatment and atrocities happening in Japan, Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, to inform others
of their own treatment in the United States,"" Oliver-Chang said.
Congressman Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, said he has also had his fair share of experiences with racism and
discrimination, but is more concerned about how much longer this issue will continue.
""There are a number of instances that really stick out, but I think what Asian Americans often feel is just this perpetual and
constant and rhythmic erosion of belonging that takes its toll,"" Kim said. ""I think it worries me and others, not just about
how we get through this moment and are we safe, but where are we heading as a country in this direction.""
What's being done
Experts and advocates agree the rise in Asian American attacks in 2020 became more prevalent after President Donald
Trump began to routinely refer to the COVID-19 pandemic as the ""China virus.""

Alvin Moua returned from work to his Woodbury townhouse this week to find an anonymous letter taped to the door:
""We're watching you [expletives]. take the chinese virus back to china. We don't want you ... infecting us with your
diseases!!!!!!!!!!""
The note was signed, ""your friendly neighbors.""
""My blood was boiling,"" recalled Moua, a 28-year-old account manager at a staffing agency who is a native-born
American of Hmong descent.
Some Asian-Americans in the Twin Cities and across the nation are facing hostility as the U.S. becomes the country with
the largest number of cases of COVID-19, caused by a virus that President Donald Trump controversially dubbed the
""Chinese flu.""
In New York, an Asian-American woman was punched in the face by a woman who denounced her heritage and
demanded to know where her face mask was. In California, a 16-year-old Asian-American boy was attacked by
classmates who accused him of carrying the virus.
In Minnesota, people of East Asian descent more commonly report getting rude looks or comments from other patrons in
stores, community leaders say.
The Minnesota Department of Human Rights says it has started to hear about bias incidents targeting Asian-Americans.
And state agencies, such as the Department of Health, are reminding people not to make assumptions about who has
the disease based on their ethnic background.

Public health experts have discouraged attaching a nationality to the virus and raised concerns that Trump's word choice
could increase xenophobic attacks, though Trump has said that he's being accurate, not racist. The president clarified
this week that it was important to ""protect our Asian-American community"" and that the spread of COVID-19 is not their
fault.
As an investigator in the Attorney General's Office, Thai Heu has been tracking bias complaints from the Asian-American
community and visited Moua's home Thursday to interview him. He also interviewed a Hmong apartment manager in
Woodbury who found a handwritten note in a box where rent payments are dropped off that read, ""Go back to your
country or I kill you, Chinese!""
Heu said he knows many Hmong people who have been getting ammunition and weapons to protect themselves and
their families.
The tension hit home recently for Mysee Chang, a 28-year-old resident of St. Paul, when she got a phone call from her
Hmong step-grandmother who said through tears, ""I don't feel safe, what do I do?""
As shoppers clamored to get groceries to ride out the pandemic, Chang said, a man confronted her step-grandmother for
taking one of the last packages of chicken. Chang said the man apparently thought her grandmother was Chinese and
said, ""You are the reason why this is happening, so you don't deserve this meat.""
A cousin who lives in the Woodbury apartment complex where the death threat was sent said she fears someone will be
watching when she goes out.
Chang said she has been working to relay precautions about social distancing to Hmong elders and has encouraged
relatives to postpone two traditional funerals that would have brought out hundreds of people. But while she feels she
knows how to handle the public health aspect of the pandemic, she's unsure how to protect her family against racism.
""I no longer feel safe,"" she said.
State Rep. Jay Xiong, DFL-St. Paul, said in a Facebook post that he rolled down his car window in a store parking lot
recently and realized that a man was yelling racist comments at him.
""Among the obscenities he hurled included calling me a [racial slur] and telling me that a disease-ridden person like
myself should go back to my country,"" Xiong said.
""I am both saddened and outraged that as a Hmong-American born and raised in St. Paul, I had to hear such racist
nonsense,"" he wrote. ""I have heard similar stories out in [the] community, and there have been worse manifestations of
such incidents, which include violence.""
Xiong did not respond to requests for an interview.
""It's these types of things that we're hearing about,"" said Taylor Putz, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of
Human Rights. Putz noted, however, that the agency's authority extends only to discrimination in housing, employment
and education.
""So if your neighbor calls and yells at you and says, 'Go back to your country with your virus because you're Asian,'
although that's not a friendly thing to do at all, that's not [what] falls under the Minnesota Human Rights Act,"" he said.
In Woodbury, Moua's landlord reported the racist note to the police.
""Ninety-nine percent of the community is great -- I haven't had an issue,"" Moua said. ""It's always just that one person
that ruins it.""
Members of the Coalition of Asian American Leaders network have reported recent bias incidents related to the virus,
such as cashiers refusing to serve them, according to executive director Bo Thao-Urabe. The coalition is holding a
webinar April 10 to talk about dealing with xenophobia and discrimination during the pandemic. Featured speakers
include Asian-American historian Erika Lee and Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero.

202101,"
A new initiative to beef up hate crime investigations in Minnesota has stalled in the waning days of the state Legislature as lawmakers focus on a budget gap brought on by the
COVID-19 pandemic.
A proposal sparked by State Attorney General Keith Ellison and state Rep. Frank Hornstein, DFL-Minneapolis, would require new statewide training for police, new data collection
policies, criminalize hate-fueled property damage and set up a statewide blueprint for how police should respond to hate crimes.
Growing out of Ellison's statewide tour last year to shine a light on rural and urban hate crimes, the legislation hit a roadblock in recent weeks as lawmakers confront a $2.4
billion deficit stemming from economic dislocations related to the coronavirus.
Ellison said in an interview this week that a recent anti-Asian backlash during the pandemic -- which originated in China -- underscores the bill's urgency.
""I think that there aren't enough people who understand the true dangers associated with being targeted by a hate crime -- particularly for people in the Asian community right
now,"" Ellison said. ""I just think that there are too many people who think, 'Well it's not happening to me so it's not happening and it's not a priority.' And I think that's a crying
shame.""
Hornstein, sponsor of the House bill, said his proposal hit a dead end in the Senate even though it has bipartisan support. GOP state Sens. Karin Housley, of St. Marys Point, and
Paul Anderson, of Plymouth, are co-sponsors of a similar bill introduced by Sen. Ron Latz, a St. Louis Park Democrat.
During a House hearing on the bill last week, some Republican legislators mainly cited fiscal concerns. Hornstein's proposal was expected to cost Minnesota $854,000 next year.
That would pay for five new full-time employees to the Human Rights Department and one to the Peace Office Standards and Training Board. It would also cover improved data
collection and work on a new law enforcement training course.
""I can't vote for this bill because it still has a significant cost and we don't have any money,"" said Marion O'Neill, R-Maple Lake. ""So I would love to vote for this bill, I think it's a
great bill, but unless the Department of Human Rights can just shift staff to do this, I can't support it. It's just too expensive.""
Hornstein, the son of Holocaust survivors, noted that his bill passed its first committee unanimously before the virus hit Minnesota. He also pointed out that GOP opposition in a
House judiciary committee this month stemmed largely from fiscal concerns.
Hornstein described the bill's reporting, training and property crime provisions as a ""comprehensive"" change to how Minnesota responds to hate crimes.
""Those are three significant steps forward and those passed two House committees,"" Hornstein said.
""I think we're well-positioned to build on this success for next year.""
But backers of the legislation say the pandemic continues to highlight the need for quicker action.
Last month, Gov. Tim Walz launched a discrimination helpline over reports of bias against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the complaints have
involved people being harassed at grocery stores by other customers.
Another incident involved an Asian-American couple in Woodbury who received an anonymous letter telling them to ""take the chinese virus back to china.""
Ellison said he had to abruptly end a recent Zoom conference call with Hmong community leaders when someone infiltrated the call with blasts of hate-filled messages.
Minnesota law enforcement reported 126 hate crimes to the FBI last year, its lowest total since 2016 and first decrease since 2014.
But nine out of every 10 Minnesota police departments -- including those in cities like Duluth and some of the largest suburban cities -- reported zero bias crimes for the year.

Carl Chan was shopping at the San Francisco Premium Outlets when he covered his mouth to cough a little. A couple standing about 20 to 30 feet away from him stared in
alarm. The woman turned and ran away.
Another time, he was walking down an Oakland street with a group of people when someone started coughing. It wasn’t Chan, but people turned around, glared at him and
covered their mouth.
The dirty looks happened weeks ago, before California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state's 40 million residents to stay at home. Before President Donald Trump referred to
the deadly COVID-19 as the ""Chinese virus. "" Before the coronavirus pandemic sent the country’s economy into a tailspin. And before it killed hundreds of Americans and
infected thousands more.
“They look at me and think I’m some kind of virus,” said Chan, president of the Oakland Chinatown Chamber of Commerce.
Anti-Asian American sentiment: Asian American lawmakers sound the alarm on coronavirus-related discrimination
Across the U. S. , Asian Americans have become the target of xenophobic and bigoted attacks as the pandemic wreaks havoc in American society. Experts said the scapegoating
is fueled by harmful rhetoric from politicians, including the president, who later called for the protection of Asian Americans from xenophobic attacks after repeatedly calling
COVID-19 the ""Chinese virus. ""
In recent months, people of Asian descent – not just Chinese Americans – have been shunned, verbally abused, named-called, coughed and spat on, even physically assaulted,
said Russell Jeung, chair of the Asian American Studies Department at San Francisco State University who’s been studying bias-related incidents against Asian Americans during
the coronavirus epidemic.
The scapegoating is reminiscent of old racist tropes that led to discriminatory policies against Asian immigrants in the United States – from the quarantining of San Francisco’s
Chinatown during the bubonic plague of the 1900s, to the rounding up of Japanese Americans in internment camps during World War II, experts and advocates said.
Wearing face masks, a practice that began in Asian countries for cultural and environmental reasons and has crossed over to immigrant communities in the United States, has
now become a racialized symbol of the virus.
“If you’re wearing a mask, you’re seen as a disease carrier. If you’re not wearing a mask, you’re seen as a disease carrier but negligent,” Jeung said.
In New York City, the Commission on Human Rights, which investigates incidents of harassment, discrimination and bias, has received a “sharp increase” in calls about COVID-
19 related discrimination that includes incidents of bias against Asian Americans, spokeswoman Alicia McCauley said. McCauley said she’s unable to give an exact number, but
the agency is receiving calls daily.
The New York Police Department is investigating an attack against a woman who was yelled at and assaulted at a subway station. A viral video shows the woman, who appeared
to be of Asian descent and was wearing a mask, running as a man chased and struck her.

The department’s Hate Crimes Task Force tweeted Monday that it was aware of reports of “several COVID-19 related hate crimes” and “arrests have been made in most cases. ”
NYPD’s spokesman did not respond to questions, including how many reports and arrests have been made, or if the victims were of Asian descent.
The state’s attorney general, Letitia James, also recently launched a hotline for New Yorkers to report hate crimes related to coronavirus.
“No one should live in fear for their lie because of who they are, what they look like, or where they come from,” James said in a statement Monday.
In Bellevue, Washington, police chief Steve Mylett said he’s seen a 178% increase in the number of applications for firearm transfers. The state requires firearm dealerships to
report all firearm transfers to local police. Mylett said a significant number of applicants appeared to have last names consistent with Chinese heritage.
Harassment and other bias-related incidents have “put enough fear into them that they felt like they needed to arm themselves to protect themselves and their families,” Mylett
said.
But despite the abundance of anecdotal evidence reported in the media and by advocacy groups, many police departments, including Mylett’s, said they have not seen any
significant uptick in the number of hate-crime reports related to COVID-19. This suggests that people may be hesitant, if not fearful, to go to police.

Recent hate crimes and violent assaults against people of Asian descent should sound an alarm for America. Within the past month, an acid attack against a woman in New York
caused her to suffer severe burns, and a man in Texas was charged with attempted murder after attacking an Asian American family.
Such stories have become disturbingly frequent since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the FBI has warned that this trend may continue.
On March 20, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights expressed concern over violent attacks against people of Asian descent. Asian American and Pacific Islander leaders have
condemned such bigotry.
And a bipartisan coalition of nearly 200 foreign policy and national security professionals support this letter condemning hate crimes and calling for solidarity (see the full list at
USATODAY.com/opinion/).
There are many ways in which the COVID-19 pandemic has brought out the best of our nation: health care workers laboring around the clock, scientists racing to develop a
vaccine. Alarmingly, however, the crisis has also exacerbated prejudice.
All Americans must redouble the fight against those forces.
U.S. leaders must take action against anti-Asian racism by adhering to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which details ways to reduce and avoid
stigma and discrimination. Terms such as ""Chinese virus"" stoke discrimination.
America has a history of associating immigrants with diseases. We must learn from that painful history and continue to fight to uphold greater equality of rights and opportunity.
America is strongest when it lives up to its guiding principles, including the embrace of diversity and inclusion.
History teaches us that injustice and divisions in the United States can be exploited by other governments. These issues can play into the Chinese Communist Party's
propaganda in ways that undermine U.S. unity, national interests and global leadership while weakening Washington's critiques of Beijing's human rights abuses.
U.S. policies must also address the inequities, including access to health care, that are causing African Americans, Native Americans, Latinx and other communities to
disproportionately experience the worst impacts of COVID-19.

202006,"
In California’s Alameda County, a Chinese American man was screamed at while mowing his lawn. The local prosecutor said the man was told to get out of America.
In neighboring Santa Clara County, a Vietnamese couple was threatened while in a grocery store. Officials said the man turned his hand into the shape of a gun.
In New York City, people of Asian descent were assaulted, kicked, pushed and accosted on subway trains.
The theme: This virus is your fault.
People of Asian descent have reported being shunned, verbally abused, name-called, coughed and spat on, even physically assaulted as the coronavirus pandemic continues to
upend American life. As the political rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic escalates, law enforcement officials and human rights advocates have seen an increasing number
of hate crimes and incidents of harassment and discrimination against Asian Americans.
'They ... think I'm some kind of virus': What it's like to be Asian during the coronavirus pandemic
New York City, for example, has seen 16 coronavirus-related hate crime incidents; many of which involved Asian victims. The city’s human rights commission has received
hundreds of harassment and discrimination complaints since February, the majority of which involved anti-Asian sentiments.
Police and prosecutors are on high alert, releasing public service announcements, holding town hall meetings and opening hotlines to ask people to report hate crimes and hate
speech that, while not criminal, could escalate to violence.
“We have a large Asian population, and we have a lot of elderly Asian population who are getting scared to death about being preyed upon by somebody who’s willing to resort
to that behavior,” said Nancy O’Malley, the district attorney of Alameda County, where Asians are 32% of the population. “You have one ethnic group that’s targeted … and
ignorant people who think they can just scream at somebody because of their ethnicity. ... We cannot tolerate that.”
O’Malley said there have been no hate crimes in her county, but there have been several incidents of verbal assaults and harassment that don’t rise to the level of a crime. Still,
O’Malley’s office has encouraged people to report such incidents.
COVID-19 and racism: Asian American lawmakers sound the alarm on coronavirus-related discrimination
“Speech is not a crime,” she said, “(but) we want to make sure we’re intervening before it becomes a crime, to educate somebody about cultures and diversity.”
In Seattle, schoolteacher Kert Lin was driving into a Home Depot parking lot when another driver screamed at him: ""Open your eyes! Go back to China!""
Lin said the incident, which happened not far from Seattle's international district, rattled him. He told the Seattle Police Department what happened, but he said because no
crime was committed, there's nothing police can do.
""This is also our city,"" he said. ""We just want to be safe.""
In Stevens Point, Wisconsin, about 2½ hours from Milwaukee, police arrested a man who they said harassed Asian customers for wearing a mask inside a grocery store. In
Santa Clara County, the man who threatened the Vietnamese couple by turning his hand into the shape of a gun has been charged with a misdemeanor hate crime.
“I wish we didn’t have the one case, but the fact that we only had one case is a testament to the people that live here,” Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen said, although
he added that hate crimes are historically underreported. Asians are about 38% of the county’s population.
Rosen’s office recently published a public service announcement calling on people to not assign places and nationalities to the pandemic. The World Health Organization has
urged scientists, government officials and the media to avoid using geographic locations as names for public health crises.
“This isn’t the fault of Chinese Americans that are here. … Asian Americans are very well integrated into our society,” Rosen said. “If you’re turning on the TV news to hear about
the latest research from Stanford about COVID-19, you might be looking at an Asian American epidemiologist.”

Three days after Orange County's top health official resigns — she'd received threats for her face mask requirement — there's a change of heart. And bills on reparations and
affirmative action move through the legislature. Plus: Stick around for my convo with a leading unemployment expert about ways to help the hardest-hit workers.

But first, we fact-check the claim that 449,000 Californians who were excused from jury duty because they are not citizens can vote. They cannot. But there's more to this

O.C. lifts mask order after threats to public health official, who resigned
Days after his predecessor abruptly quit, Orange County's new interim health officer lifted a requirement that residents wear face coverings in public to help slow the spread of
the coronavirus.
The move comes three days after Dr. Nichole Quick quit as the county's health officer following threats at a public meeting and on social media over her order that residents
wear masks in public when near others. Residents have blasted the requirement at public meetings, and the sheriff said he wouldn’t enforce it.

Reparations, and ending a ban on affirmative action?
Two legislative proposals designed to help eradicate structural inequality are making their way through the state legislature, fueled in part by large demonstrations in response
to the death of George Floyd.
A proposal to establish a task force to study and prepare recommendations for how to give reparations to African Americans passed the California Assembly on Thursday.
“We seem to recognize that justice requires that those who have been treated unjustly need the means to make themselves whole again,” said Assemblywoman Shirley Weber, a
Democrat from San Diego who wrote the bill.
If the bill passes the Senate and is signed into law by Gov. Gavin Newsom, eight people with backgrounds in racial justice reforms would lead a study into who would be eligible
for compensation and how it should be awarded.
A day earlier, the Assembly passed a proposal to erase the state's 24-year ban on affirmative action. If passed by the Senate and approved by voters, it would strike from
California’s Constitution the rules imposed by Proposition 209, which in 1996 prohibited government agencies and institutions from considering race, ethnicity or gender.
Affirmative action policies were initially put into place to address historical and present-day discrimination.
The two measures are among the top priorities for California's Legislative Black Caucus, which Weber heads.

Unemployment claims are down, but is that a good thing?
The news on the surface sounds good: Unemployment claims are going down and/or being denied because more people are returning to work and earning more money.
Then you dig deeper.
There, you'll see that going back to work, for many people, means taking home less than they did when they weren't working, because of the additional $600 in federal
unemployment they would miss out on. And the situation is hurting already disadvantaged workers the most.
Those are some findings from UCLA's California Policy Lab's unemployment analysis released Thursday. I spoke via email to co-author Till von Wachter, the lab's faculty director
and a UCLA economics professor, more about their findings and what could help.
Our conversation has been lightly edited.
Q: Let’s start with some good news. What about the numbers cheer you?
A: The fact that we see an increasing number of Californians whose UI (Unemployment Insurance) payments are being either reduced or denied altogether because they’re
working is a good sign for the economy as we slowly re-open. That being said, going back to work also creates a challenging dilemma for some workers: If you’re going back to
work on a reduced schedule (with reduced pay), this part-time work can result in your UI benefits being either denied or reduced.
And, of course, there’s still ongoing safety concerns for workers around COVID-19, as well as childcare issues for working parents.
Q: The brief shows how an increasing number of people are getting denied unemployment because of partial income. Is there a minimum people can earn before they’re cut off
from unemployment or is it based on percentage reduction of your usual income?
When you file for unemployment insurance, EDD (The division which handles Unemployment Insurance) takes a look at your earnings history, and determines a weekly benefit
amount, which is the maximum you can be paid in benefits each week.
For claimants whose amount is below the cap of $450, they can typically earn up to 75% of their prior average weekly earnings. If they earn more than that in a given week,
they aren’t eligible for any benefits. But it’s week by week, so if they earn less in the next week, then they could be eligible to receive unemployment again.
Q: Your findings show one in four women, as opposed to one in five men, are affected by the crisis. Why are women impacted so much more?
Some of this, though not all, can be explained by the nature of the crisis: We’ve seen that several of the industries hardest hit by the pandemic are often the ones where more
women tend to work. In particular, women make up a disproportionate share of the labor force employed in accommodation, food services and sales, industries hit especially
hard by the shutdowns.
Q: I’ve heard from a lot of people that they’re making more in unemployment than working because of the extra $600 federal unemployment assistance. So should people go
back to work if they can?
A: Generally speaking, yes, the Unemployment Insurance system in the U.S. is structured in such a way as to encourage people to go back to work because you’ll make more
money. That being said, policymakers created the $600 FPUC payment because they recognized the unique circumstances created by the COVID-19 crisis and all of the social
distancing challenges it created, especially for the labor market.
While earning a bit of extra money during the shutdown helps many workers, the $600 payment is set to expire next month, and hence workers may return to work when they
can since the risk of being unemployed and uninsured again in July may outweigh the benefits of a few weeks of extra cash now.
Q: The report suggests a program like work sharing could help workers. How does it work?
A: Work sharing programs allow firms to avoid layoffs by instead reducing hours for a group of employees. For these employees, a portion of their lost pay is replaced with
prorated UI benefits. Importantly, for companies re-opening at reduced hours, work sharing allows some employees who would otherwise earn too much money in a week to
remain eligible for partial UI, to instead receive these benefits, and also receive the $600 weekly FPUC payment.
Q: What else could be done to help workers and/or business owners who have been hit so hard because of this pandemic?
A: The $600 FPUC payments are a lifeline for many workers. Even with these payments, the median weekly benefit amount for initial claimants in California is just above 50% of
median family income in the state. Without these additional payments, many families out of work would be facing even more severe income shocks, which will have
repercussions throughout the economy as they’re forced to further reduce spending.
Tying such benefits to a meaningful economic trigger as opposed to an arbitrary calendar date should be a high priority.
Q: Anything I didn’t ask or you want to add?
A: The report also finds that close to 80% of workers who filed unemployment insurance benefits during the crisis could have received a payment. The typical UI claimant could
have been paid within two weeks of filing benefits. While this may not have been true for every claimant, overall it seems the system was able to provide support for
unemployed workers in a timely fashion!

202006,"
At a time of national crisis when Americans could benefit from rallying together, attitudes toward racial minorities seem to be hardening, especially when it comes to Asian and
Black Americans.
A study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center released Wednesday shows that nearly 40% of Asian and Black Americans – as well as 27% of Hispanics – say they’ve had
adverse experiences because of their race or ethnicity since the coronavirus outbreak began. Those experiences include hearing slurs or jokes or fearing someone may threaten
or physically attack them.
By contrast, only 13% of whites reported similar instances.
In addition, almost 40% of U.S. adults – including 58% of the respondents of Asian descent – said it’s more common for people to express racist views about Asians than before
the outbreak. And both Black Americans (42%) and Asian Americans (36%) expressed a significant degree of concern that they might arouse suspicion if they wear a mask
when in stores or other businesses.
That’s a particularly worrisome response considering the consensus of health experts that wearing face coverings helps curb the virus’ spread, which has led public officials in
several cities and states to make them mandatory when in public.
'We just want to be safe': Hate crimes, harassment of Asian Americans rise amid pandemic
John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice – AAJC, said the findings reflect the feedback his advocacy organization and others have
been getting for months.
The Anti-Defamation League said in mid-June that since January there has been a surge in reports of harassment and threats targeting Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders,
including comments such as “Go back to China’’ and accusations of “bringing the virus’’ to the U.S.
“Our community is struggling to cope with COVID-19 xenophobic attacks, and it is heartbreaking to know that both Asian and Black people have to struggle with the paradox of
putting their safety at risk when they are wearing face masks to protect their health,” Yang said. “With this research report, we now have the data to show that language
continuing to fan the flames of xenophobia is heightening the direct discrimination and aggression our communities face.”
Some of those flames have been stoked by President Donald Trump, who early in the pandemic made repeated references to the “Chinese virus’’ – COVID-19 originated in China
– and lately has taken to referring to the virus as the “kung flu.’’
In a Pew survey released June 12, researchers found 48% of the general public believed Trump has made things worse when it comes to race relations, a belief shared by 68%
of Black Americans and 62% of Asian Americans.
Black unemployment: African Americans bear brunt of economic crisis sparked by the coronavirus
Zhengyu Huang, president of the Committee of 100, an organization of prominent Chinese Americans, said Asian Americans increasingly find themselves blamed for the
coronavirus by people in this country who view them as foreigners, not as fellow citizens.
“These threats of violence and discrimination don’t exist in a vacuum,’’ Huang said. “That is why C100 has called repeatedly on political candidates, including President Trump, to
refrain from inflammatory or divisive rhetoric, deliberate fearmongering and the use of race or racially coded advertising for political gain.’’
The survey released Wednesday polled 9,654 American adults and was done June 4-10, at a time of widespread protests after the death of George Floyd at the hands of police
in Minneapolis.
Neil Ruiz, associate director of global migration and demography research for the Pew Research Center, said some of the responses may have been influenced by those
demonstrations and the national conversation about racism they sparked.
For example, although 45% of Black adults responding to the survey said it’s more common for people to express racist views against them, 51% said they have heard
expressions of support.
Alvin Tillery, an associate professor of political science at Northwestern University who is an expert on racial and ethnic politics, said the survey accurately represents Asian and
African American communities. He added that the findings about increased hostility toward those groups are consistent with his research and what he has learned from other
sources.
Tillery said more information was needed to draw conclusions about the supportive statements Black Americans reported hearing amid a time of frequent protests, but he was
definitive in his conclusion that some of the president’s comments amid the pandemic have contributed to the antagonism against Asians in the U.S.

202006,"
WASHINGTON – The House of Representatives passed a measure Thursday condemning anti-Asian bigotry and
discrimination during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., the sponsor of the measure, told USA TODAY its passage would be “really important”
to demonstrate to Asian Americans that it's “wrong to discriminate against our community in light of the
pandemic.”
“We're glad that the House is taking a very strong and public stance against the discrimination and the violence
that is happening during this public health crisis,” she said.
Amid inflammatory political rhetoric blaming China for the pandemic from President Donald Trump and his allies,
increased numbers of Asian Americans have reported harassment and even physical assaults.
The resolution – the House’s first addressing anti-Asian discrimination related to the pandemic – passed by a
243-164 vote. All Democrats were joined by 14 Republicans in voting for the measure. Meng voted by proxy.
""The House needed to take a strong and public stand against this appalling intolerance, discrimination and
violence that has taken place all across the country during this public health crisis, and today, it did just that,""
Meng said in a statement after the vote.
The resolution does not refer to any individual’s rhetoric and instead “calls on all public officials to condemn and
denounce any and all anti-Asian sentiment in any form.” It asks for federal law enforcement to work with state
and local officials to address reports of hate incidents and crimes against Asian American communities, as well
as collect data on the incidents.

Health experts at the World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said linking
diseases to a specific location or ethnicity could perpetuate stigma.
'We just want to be safe': Hate crimes, harassment of Asian Americans rise amid coronavirus pandemic
The 2020 Asian American Voter Survey released Tuesday found that 51% of Asian Americans are concerned
about experiencing hate crimes, harassment and discrimination because of COVID-19, and 79% say there is a
lot or some discrimination against Asian people in society.
University of Maryland Professor of American Studies Janelle Wong, co-author of several books on Asian
American politics, told USA TODAY the polling showed how Asian Americans are ""still vulnerable to anti-Asian
bias and racism"" despite gains in income and education.
In March, Trump wrote in a tweet that it is “very important to totally protect our Asian American community”
after he faced fierce criticism from Asian American and public health advocates on his rhetoric about the
coronavirus, but he still refers to it as the “China virus” amid heightened tensions with Beijing.
The House measure, a nonbinding resolution, does not require the Senate to pass it, nor does it require the
president’s signature.
Meng said she hoped the measure would pass with bipartisan support and should not be controversial, but many
House Republicans opposed it. Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La., the second-ranking House Republican,
tweeted Tuesday that Democrats were “wasting their time with the measure” and would be effectively
condemning their past references to the coronavirus by its location of origin. “These people aren’t serious,” he
wrote.
“This is not a waste of time. People's lives are at stake,” Meng said.
“It is something that is important, symbolic, and should be easy to stand up in defense of the Asian American
community and to denounce violence,” she said.
On the House floor, Republicans said Democrats were trying to score political points.
Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, called the resolution “just another Democrat attack on the president,” and House
Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called it a waste of time when the House could be working on
COVID-19 relief. ""There is no kitchen in America that thinks this is a priority,"" he said.
Democrats said Republicans were more concerned about defending the president than voting to condemn hate.
""I was so dismayed to see my Republican colleagues, one after the other, come to the floor today and tell the
Asian American community that their suffering does not matter and that they are indifferent to the
consequences of the hate they are spreading,"" said Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the
Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said the legislation would shine ""a bright light on the injustice experienced
by so many, including the surge of violence and discrimination being experienced by the Asian American and
Pacific Islander community.""
Many Asian Americans were ""fighting on the front lines against COVID-19,"" but ""instead of being celebrated as
heroes, they are fighting violence and bigotry,"" she said.
Gregg Orton, director of the National Council of Asian Pacific Americans, a coalition of more than 35 advocacy
organizations, said the vote would be a “rejection” of “COVID-19-fueled racism” and Asian Americans’ fears their
concerns would be ignored.

202006,"
SAN FRANCISCO – Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the
young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough. She was weak and didn’t want to eat. What few
medications were on hand had expired. She sipped warm water instead.
“Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?” asked Amy Rong.
The mother and daughter, along with Rong’s parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-
occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways
are cramped, bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the spread of the highly contagious
novel coronavirus.
That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy’s forehead, wondering if her child would
die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the
lone sofa bed. The grandparents were eager for updates on Amy’s fever, but they worried their whispers would
wake her.
In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless
night. Rong made soup, but Amy wouldn’t eat it. She cooked porridge and spoon-fed it to her daughter.
Getting tested for COVID-19 didn’t seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were
expensive. Rong also feared the reaction from neighbors.
“If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,” said Rong. “Everyone would think you are the devil.”

It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts
a bustling Chinatown, as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians
and Filipinos also have made their homes here. All told, Asians in San Francisco represent upward of 20
countries.
But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with
the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 123 COVID-19 deaths reported by the San Francisco Department of
Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.
Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher
than the 12% reported, a by-product of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes
this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused
segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing,
employment and health.
San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a
time when officials don’t know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation’s 7.8 million
coronavirus cases. Around 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.
In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language
about testing, safety tips, housing and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the
community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line
employment and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.
“This model minority thing, that’s not us,” said Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian
Development Center, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps area residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. She
said 80% of her clients have lost their mostly service industry jobs during the pandemic.
“There is the language barrier and our community is small,” Young said. “So the city doesn’t think we have any
problems when we do.”
That risk of invisibility is only heightened by the pandemic. Since city health officials do not break down
COVID-19 statistics beyond “Asian American,” many advocates for the city’s various groups said they are left to
speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities. How many people are
dying, and are those people Japanese Americans? Vietnamese? Korean? Filipino? No one knows.
“There’s this feeling that there's excess death out there,” said Jeffrey Caballero, executive director of the
nonprofit Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. “That high mortality rate among Asian
Americans means either there isn’t enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.”
What is the model minority myth?
Xing Tam’s mother tested positive for COVID-19 in March. Her symptoms were mild. Medical officials told her to
quarantine at home and avoid others.
Suddenly, the working class Bayview district home where Tam, his mother and 17 other relatives and friends live
together became uncomfortably crowded. Tam's mother was given one of the three-story home's 12 rooms. For
weeks, everyone in the two-story house feared they would be next.
As his mother recovered, Tam, 39, fretted about the cost of health care if he got sick. He worried the doctors
wouldn’t be able to speak to him in words he could understand.
Before the pandemic, life had started to improve for Tam. Five years ago, San Francisco relatives urged him to
leave China's Guangdong Province and try his luck in the U.S. He learned some English and landed a job at a

hotel in catering. But when COVID-19 hit, his job vanished.
The cost of housing in San Francisco is so expensive, his family has no option but to live together.
“Even if I test positive, I feel there is nothing the government will do to help me more,” he said. “I can see
why some people look at Asians here and feel we are all well-off because we work hard and save whenever
we can. But for many of us, it’s very challenging.”
For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the
corrosive and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California,
San Francisco professor of medicine.
Nguyen co-authored a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to
the fact that 50% of San Francisco’s 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans,
disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.
Although that percentage has since dropped, Nguyen said a lack of detailed data about Asian Americans often
means that city funds aren’t allocated to this group.
“The truth is we are the ones who lose out as a result of this stereotype,” he added.
To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The
median annual income of households headed by the nation’s 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060,
compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.
But these success stories obscure the troubling reality facing many Asian Americans.
“You simply cannot look at Asian Americans as a monolithic group because if you do that, you’re going to
miss how different communities experience the pandemic,” said Jarvis Chen, a lecturer in social and
behavioral sciences at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Massachusetts.
A closer look at San Francisco's two dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad
categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English
speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. census data. About a third of San Franciscans are
foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.
“With Asian Americans, the average always is pulled way up by those doing very well, which means you miss
the groups who clearly are not,” said Margaret Simms, a nonresident fellow with The Urban Institute in
Washington, D.C., who specializes in race and labor economics. The think tank found nearly 13% of Asian
American senior citizens live in poverty compared to a 9% national average.
Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop
AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of
discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March. The attacks have ranged from verbal assaults to acts of
physical violence.
When Asian Americans hear President Donald Trump, who contracted COVID-19 in October, repeatedly call
the virus the “China virus” and “Kung Flu,” “it makes them less likely to seek help, a bit like early in the AIDS
epidemic when the gay community was stigmatized,” said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy
at the University of California, Riverside and chair of the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander
American Affairs. “We fear many Asian American families have gone underground.”
Decades of racist policies have limited Asian American’s standard of living

Chinese citizens began passing through San Francisco’s then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the
Gold Rush of 1849. By 1851, some 25,000 had arrived, lured by the hope of riches in a land called Gum
Saan in Cantonese, or “gold mountain.”
By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from entering the country, with
few exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from
other Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush’s boom and the construction of the
Transcontinental Railroad.
At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to
internment camps, feared as the traitorous “yellow peril” after years of citizenship. Despite painful and
humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to engrain themselves in
the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans. Japanese Americans
were among the most decorated U.S. soldiers during the war, and others excelled in academics and
commerce.
The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian
American success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other
nations, namely the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups,
notably Black Americans.
The logic went that if Asian Americans were doing so well, surely failure on the part of other ethnic groups
was their own fault.
Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees
followed by countless others who escaped Southeast Asia in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.
“The stereotype about us is broad and includes the notion that we’re all studious, we don’t get into trouble
and commit crimes, and even the poor don’t have health care issues,” said Ellen Wu, author of “The Color
of Success: Asian Americans and the Origins of the Model Minority” and history professor at Indiana
University in Bloomington. “That’s quite the change from before World War II when many of us were seen
as unclean and prone to diseases.”
California Assemblymember David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and
chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian
Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.
“The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important,
but our issue hasn’t gotten the attention it deserves,” he said.
One small demographic victory for Asian Americans came in 1997 when President Bill Clinton directed the
Office of Management and Budget to expand its data classification system to break out “Native Hawaiian or
Other Pacific Islanders” from the Asian American group. That geographic list includes countries such as
Micronesia, Tonga, Vanuatu, Guam, the Marshall Islands and Fiji.
As a result, we know today that Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of COVID-19 deaths, behind Native
Americans and Black Americans.
But many other Asians said they are largely neglected by government officials.
What disappoints Marc Belocura most, he said, is that he feels ignored despite living in a part of town that
city officials once highlighted as a bastion of Filipino culture.
""Since the city obviously knows we are here, why is there not more outreach that is culturally sensitive and

linguistically appropriate?"" said Belocura, 23. ""Or maybe we just are not on their radar.""
Belocura girds himself each time he prepares to leave the one-room studio he shares with his parents
and sister to shop for food and supplies.
Even before COVID-19, his aging neighborhood just south of Market Street was crumbling. Now more
storefronts have shuttered. To avoid the homeless camps that have mushroomed across the area,
Belocura walks in the street and hopes he doesn’t get hit by a car.
When he makes it home, he must then navigate a narrow stairwell to get into his one-room apartment
on the second floor of a five-story building.
Belocura's parents, who are 71 and 60, share the lone bed. His sister, 35, and he put pillows on the floor
each night. Transmission in the studio’s confines would likely be immediate.
""That's why I just can't get COVID when I go out,” he said. “I can’t.”
COVID-19 information hard to find in other languages
Asian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin,
Cantonese, Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese and Hindi. The city’s
website notes that COVID-19 information is available in English, Chinese, Filipino and Spanish.
Efforts by city health officials to inform Asian residents about COVID-19 safety precautions and testing
in their native languages have sometimes resulted in confusing or alienating translations.
For example, information about pop-up virus testing sites sometimes can come across as demands,
while in other cases the language is just plain confusing.
One flyer written in the Filipino language of Tagalog told people to “cover their entire face,” said Luisa
Antonio, executive director of the Bayanihan Equity Center, a Filipino American support group.
In another instance, an Aug. 11 health advisory issued by the city showed Tier 1 Priority were those
hospitalized with symptoms, Tier 2 was anyone with symptoms or close contact with confirmed cases,
and Tier 2A included a list of ethnic groups “experiencing marginalization, systemic inequity and health
inequities.”
Black, Latino, Native American and Pacific Islander residents were mentioned – but no other Asian
groups, said Dr. Amy Tang, director of immigrant health at North East Medical Services, a health clinic
that focuses on the city’s Chinese American population.
“To not include other Asians among ethnic minorities who should get tested is pretty appalling,” said
Tang.
Department of Public Health officials declined an interview request about outreach efforts. An e-mailed
response from the city’s COVID-19 Command Center offered condolences to the loved ones of those who
died from COVID-19 and noted that a majority of people who died were over 60 and had underlying
health conditions.
In California, about 5 million of 40 million state residents are Asian American, and in three-quarters of
those homes, languages other than English are spoken regularly, according to the U.S. census.
Sasanna Yee, co-founder of the nonprofit Communities as One, said city officials need to pay closer
attention to capturing the cultural nuances that are sometimes lost in poor translations.

Depending on how things are written, they can trigger alarm, Yee added. “Who is asking me to come
out? What is this information used for? Can I trust who is asking me to do this?”
Even some Asian Americans who speak fluent English said government officials have not made it easy
to get information about the virus.
Huiting ""Rita"" Huang grew alarmed when her mother-in-law told her that there had been a positive
coronavirus case among the Chinese emigres to whom she was providing nursing services. The
mother-in-law was unsure what to do and feared her poor English would make getting information
about where to get tested even harder.
Huang felt confident she could help. Her English was solid and she had experience getting COVID-19
information as a project coordinator and health educator for the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health
Coalition.
Instead, she wound up mired in a bureaucratic doom loop. After pursuing a series of online testing-
site leads through a variety of city- and community-run websites – all requiring fluency in English –
Huang soon learned that there were no available appointments at testing facilities close to their
neighborhood.
Huang eventually found a city-run testing site near Pier 30 along San Francisco Bay. The test was
negative.
""That was frustrating for me, and I speak English,"" said Huang. ""I can't imagine what it would be like
for someone like my mother-in-law. Well, I imagine you would simply give up on the hope of getting
tested.""
Some residents refuse to get tested
Asian Americans in San Francisco are often left behind by city partnerships aimed at helping
vulnerable populations. Efforts to increase COVID-19 testing sites largely involve Latino groups, such
as Unidos En Salud. The city's various isolation and quarantine sites for the homeless and partially
housed also are being used largely by the city's Latino population, with Hispanics making up 45% of
those in shelters while Asians account for 7%.
Asian activists and health care workers trying to fill the void said they face a population that often is
wary of Western medicine, fatalistic about getting the virus, culturally averse to passing along bad
news to elders and nervous about losing employment.
Natalie Ah Soon, health planner with the Asian Pacific Islander Health Parity Coalition advocacy group,
said some people have told her, “If God means for me to be COVID-19 positive, then OK.”
Kent Woo, executive director of the NICOS Chinese Health Coalition, said residents sometimes are
suspicious of health care workers when they visit local low-income buildings to talk about coronavirus
safety tips.
""Folks say, 'What's the point of being tested?' or 'We don't know where to go if we get infected,'"" he
said. ""When we offer the option to anyone who tests positive to leave the premises and go to a hotel,
they refuse.""
Teams have started to be more proactive, he said, heading to single-room occupancy residences and
other housing complexes before there is any rumor of a positive test. The goal is to prepare residents
so they know how to respond if someone falls sick.

The need is dire. Amy Dai, project coordinator for the Chinatown Community Development Center,
an advocacy group that also manages low-income properties, learned that in a building she
manages, 10 residents out of 30 families had tested positive.
When she approached two of the residents who had come down with a fever, they assured her they
couldn’t be positive because they had not left the building. A subsequent visit to a doctor
confirmed they had COVID-19.
If they had not waited to get tested, “it could have prevented the other infections,” said Dai.
The virus has many of San Francisco’s Asian Americans living like shut-ins.
Only reluctantly did Sisong Thepkaysone, 70, recently make her way from her public housing
building overlooking a freeway to her doctor’s office for a routine check-up. She hasn’t seen any
information about COVID-19 testing in her native Laotian. All she knows is she must stay healthy.
The trip filled her with dread. With some public transportation routes canceled, she had to change
buses, prolonging her exposure. Worse yet, some passengers weren't wearing masks.
“I’m old, I have asthma,” Thepkaysone, a former Thai-restaurant cook who fled war-torn Laos with
three young boys and no husband in 1981, said through an interpreter. “I’m not sure what I would
do if I got the virus.”
Once at the doctor’s office, an interpreter was called by phone to translate medication directions.
Thepkaysone grew upset. She expected quality medical care after the risk she had put herself
through, not a faceless voice.
“It was not a personal experience, she said. “I didn’t like it.”
Thepkaysone prefers to spend her days at home making Laotian dishes for relatives. She used to
go out to shop and visit a local Buddhist temple to give alms. But now her children shop for her
and the temple is closed. Sometimes she checks in on friends through Facebook. She watches
television, but her limited knowledge of English renders programs a pantomime.
“I’m careful,” she said. “All I know is the virus is easy to get.”
No end in sight
Rong never found out whether her daughter had COVID-19. But her days remain filled with dread.
For the past few months, the family has had little money for food or rent, which is $750 a month.
Sometimes, neighbors give them something to eat; other times she goes to the local food bank.
“We eat lots of potatoes,” she said.
It’s a far cry from the life she envisioned for herself. In Guangdong Province, Rong had a promising
job as a clothing store clerk. At the urging of her former husband’s parents, she emigrated 12
years ago to California, where she found work as a janitor to keep the family afloat. Since the
pandemic hit, she has been on unemployment insurance.
That’s left the family with no option but to remain in their Chinatown apartment. The communal
kitchen isn’t cleaned regularly. Sometimes, leaks from a floor above make their way to the shower
on the floor below. Often, the leaking fluid smells like urine.

202006,"
A Louisiana pastor prays as his parishioners die, first from cancer and now from COVID-19. An Indigenous community in New Mexico lacks adequate health care as the death toll mounts. A
sick hospital worker in New Jersey frets about infecting others in her heavily populated neighborhood.
As the country cries out for a vaccine and a return to normal, lost in the policy debates is the reality that COVID-19 kills far more people of color than white Americans. This isn't a matter
of coincidence, poor choices or bad luck — it's by design.
A team of USA TODAY reporters explored how the policies of the past and present have made Black, Asian, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans prime targets for COVID-19. They found:
America's education and economic systems are still unequal, disproportionately leaving people of color out of higher-wage jobs. When COVID-19 struck, more people of color were serving
as essential workers directly in the path of the virus.
Decades of discrimination in housing corralled people of color into tightly packed neighborhoods, fueling the virus' spread. Those neighborhoods tend to lie in ""food deserts,"" leading to
diabetes, obesity and heart disease that make people more likely to die from the virus.
Environmental policies designed by white power brokers at the expense of the poor has poisoned the air they breathe, fueling cancers and leaving communities weakened in the path of the
virus. A lack of federal funding left the most vulnerable communities cut off from healthcare at the most critical moment.
Put simply, America's history of racism was itself a preexisting condition.
Of the 10 U.S. counties with the highest death rates from COVID-19, seven have populations where people of color make up the majority, according to data compiled by USA TODAY. Of the
top 50 counties with the highest death rates, 31 are populated mostly by people of color.
""COVID-19 has brought out into the open, with painful clarity, these divisions in our society that have been there for a long time but, for one reason or another, people were able to
overlook them,"" said Philip Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College.
With nearly 1,000 people a day dying from the virus and scientists scrambling to grasp exactly how the virus spreads and kills, federal and state data has not provided enough demographic
detail to show the full impact on communities of color. The race and ethnicity of people who contract the virus is known in 52% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
But study after study has shown clear patterns in whom the virus kills.
Black people are more than twice as likely to die from the virus than white people, and Hispanics and Native Americans are 1.5 times more likely to die, according to The COVID Tracking
Project.
""You can't change the fact that America is so segregated and that people of color tend to live in communities where the environmental conditions are worse, and that can increase your risk
of heart disease or lung disease and diabetes,"" said Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation’s largest
philanthropy dedicated solely to health care. ""You can't change that in the short run.""
A team of USA TODAY reporters pored over lawsuits challenging housing and health care policies, analyzed demographic data for communities hit hardest by COVID-19 and studied
documents that reveal how government and business leaders worked together to marginalize populations. They interviewed the descendants of enslaved Americans who were denied
homeownership in white neighborhoods and Indigenous Americans who had been funneled into reservations in exchange for federally funded health care that never came. They walked
through Black communities on the fence line of polluting chemical plants, spent time with Latino farmworkers unable to afford the very food they harvested, and entered the homes of Asian
immigrants afraid of being attacked by neighbors if they tested positive for the coronavirus.
Housing policies speed spread of virus
In Essex County, New Jersey, decades of housing policies, laws and unspoken pacts excluded communities of color from spacious suburbs and forced them to cram into poor, often
neglected neighborhoods in the urban core of Newark. Now, Essex has the 12th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country, according to data compiled by USA TODAY, fueled in large
part by the high numbers of Black Americans living in segregated, low-income neighborhoods.
That includes Ahou Yao, 40, a respiratory therapist at a local hospital who contracted COVID-19 in April and was forced to self-isolate in her bedroom in the two-bedroom apartment she
shares with her husband and two young boys. She struggled from fever, shortness of breath and body aches and was unable to work for a month. Her husband had to go out for food, run
errands and navigate their crowded neighborhood.
""Now I'm scared,"" she said, ""scared that he has it, too.""
Her husband has since developed a cough and chest pains, prompting a trip to the emergency room. He started self-isolating, passing the responsibility of venturing outside back to his
wife.

In Louisiana, along a stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, former slave plantations house massive chemical plants that spew chemicals deemed
dangerous by the Environmental Protection Agency. When the plants were constructed, white homeowners had the means to move away, in time leaving a mostly Black population to
breathe toxic air and suffer from such high rates of cancer that the entire region was dubbed ""Cancer Alley.""
One of those plants, in St. John the Baptist Parish, is the only one in the nation that produces neoprene. The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions
from the production process are so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to the plant as having the highest risk of cancer in the entire country. In
September, St. John the Baptist Parish had the 27th highest death rate from COVID-19 in the nation, according to a USA TODAY analysis.
The Rev. Lionel Murphy of the Tchoupitoulas Chapel, which sits 2 miles from the chloroprene plant, has counseled many Black families over the years as they’ve come down with diabetes,
respiratory illnesses and rare cancers. Now, he’s seeing his neighbors die from COVID-19. And still, smoke billows from the plant down the road.
""People get sick, people die, you go bury them,"" Murphy said. ""But there’s no fight to erase the problem.""
Health care missing when needed
In McKinley County, New Mexico, many locals struggle to find health care.
Year after year, Congress has failed to allocate enough money to fulfill its legal obligation to provide health care to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni people who make
up the majority of McKinley County’s population. A 2018 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights titled ""Broken Promises"" found the federal government spends nearly four times as
much on health per person through government programs than it spends for each Indigenous person.
That helps explain why McKinley County has the nation's sixth-highest death rate from COVID-19, according to USA TODAY data, with more than 240 people dying in the isolated corner of
the state.
Anna Marie Rondon, executive director of the New Mexico Social Justice and Equity Institute in McKinley County (who is Diné, as the Navajo people call themselves), said the ravages of
COVID-19 are not an isolated tragedy but the latest chapter in Indigenous people’s long history of abuse and neglect from the U.S. government.
On the Navajo Nation, inadequate resources have resulted in widespread water poverty, food insecurity and high rates of illness. These daily realities were devastating long before the
pandemic, but they’ve also helped fuel a high COVID-19 death rate.
""It's really an unbelievable chain of oppression – it's still squeezing us, it still has its grip,"" Rondon said. ""And it's still killing us.""
Food deserts make people vulnerable
In California, Imperial Valley is considered the nation’s winter breadbasket, producing 80% of the country’s fresh vegetables during the cold months. But the predominantly Hispanic
workers who pick alfalfa, lettuce, sugar beets and carrots can rarely afford to buy them.
Nearly 75% of adults and 13% of children are obese or overweight for their age, according to state data. On the other end of the spectrum, 31% of kids in Imperial County don't get
enough to eat each day, according to a 2018 report by Feeding America, a national anti-hunger organization based in Washington, D.C.
""If they're already on food stamps, to spend the extra money to get fruits and vegetables, it's expensive,"" said Jessica Solorio, executive director of Spread the Love, a local food bank.
Those figures show why COVID-19 has been so fatal in the county, with 16 deaths per 10,000, nearly three times the national average, according to the USA TODAY analysis.
Cultural barriers complicate response
In San Francisco, community activists are worried that the number of Asian Americans getting COVID-19 is being vastly underreported.
Of the county’s nearly 12,000 positive test results, only 12% are Asian American, yet Asian Americans have made up 38% of the death count. Experts attribute that alarming disconnect to
a number of factors, including the fear of losing a job after a positive test, language barriers, lack of health care, growing anti-Asian hate crimes, and what’s called the ""model-minority
myth"" – an assumption that education and financial successes enjoyed by some Asian Americans applies to all 20-some Asian ethnicities.
Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a nonprofit that helps residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, said her community suffers from an average
household income a quarter of the city’s average, low high school graduation rates and obstacles to health care. Add a COVID-19 testing regime tailored to those proficient in English and
an often fatalistic attitude toward the pandemic in the community, and Young said the virus has been painful to the Asian American community.
""I've asked our clients why they're not getting tested,"" she said. ""Often the reaction I get is, 'I'm going to die anyway, and if I test positive, then I can't go to work.""
'We become invisible'
Ask Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, why so many people of color across the U.S. are dying from COVID-19 and she goes back 400
years to the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to colonial U.S. shores.
Racism is so entrenched in the American way of life, she said, that it's impossible to separate the high death rates of marginalized communities from the nation’s historic treatment of each
of them. From the broken promises of reparations to the terrible treatment of immigrants, from redlining practices that excluded Black Americans from homeownership to the GI Bill money
that went mostly to white service members returning from World War II, Wright says COVID-19 is once again revealing the precarious position people of color often find themselves in.
But with no national response from the federal government and only limited actions taken by states or localities, Wright said her people are still stuck in the same situation: invisible.
""We have built-in systems that work against Black people moving up the economic ladder,"" Wright said. ""That pattern continues.
""Racism is so entrenched that we become invisible.""

202006,"
SAN FRANCISCO – Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the
young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough.
About the series
Racist policies have made Americans of color poorer and sicker. COVID-19 made these inequities deadly. This is
the third in our investigative series deadlydiscrimination.usatoday.com.
""Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?"" asked Amy Rong.
The mother and daughter, along with Rong's parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-
occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways
are cramped, bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the spread of the highly contagious
novel coronavirus.
That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy's forehead, wondering if her child would

die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the
lone sofa bed.
In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless
night. Rong made soup, but Amy wouldn't eat it.
Getting tested for COVID-19 didn't seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were
expensive. Rong also feared the reaction from neighbors.
""If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,"" said Rong. ""Everyone would think you are the devil.""
It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts
a bustling Chinatown, as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians
and Filipinos also have made their homes here. All told, Asians in San Francisco represent upward of 20
countries.
But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with
the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 123 COVID-19 deaths reported by the San Francisco Department of
Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.
Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher
than the 12% reported, a by-product of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes
this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused
segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing,
employment and health.
San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a
time when officials don't know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation's 7.8 million
coronavirus cases. Around 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.
In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language
about testing, safety tips, housing and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the
community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line
employment and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.
""This model minority thing, that's not us,"" said Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian
Development Center, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps area residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
""There is the language barrier and our community is small,"" Young said. ""So the city doesn't think we have any
problems when we do.""
That risk of invisibility is only heightened by the pandemic. Since city health officials do not break down
COVID-19 statistics beyond ""Asian American,"" many advocates for the city's various groups said they are left to
speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities. How many people are
dying, and are those people Japanese Americans? Vietnamese? Filipino?
""There's this feeling that there's excess death out there,"" said Jeffrey Caballero, executive director of the
nonprofit Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. ""That high mortality rate among Asian
Americans means either there isn't enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.""
What is the model minority myth?
For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the corrosive
and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California, San Francisco

professor of medicine.
Nguyen co-authored a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to
the fact that 50% of San Francisco's 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans,
disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.
To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The
median annual income of households headed by the nation's 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060,
compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.
A closer look at San Francisco's two dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad
categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English
speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. census data. About a third of San Franciscans are
foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.
""With Asian Americans, the average always is pulled way up by those doing very well, which means you miss
the groups who clearly are not,"" said Margaret Simms, a nonresident fellow with The Urban Institute in
Washington, D.C., who specializes in race and labor economics. The think tank found nearly 13% of Asian
American senior citizens live in poverty compared to a 9% national average.
Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop
AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of
discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March. The attacks have ranged from verbal assaults to acts of
physical violence.
When Asian Americans hear President Donald Trump, who contracted COVID-19 in October, repeatedly call
the virus the ""China virus"" and ""Kung Flu,"" ""it makes them less likely to seek help, a bit like early in the AIDS
epidemic when the gay community was stigmatized,"" said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy
at the University of California, Riverside and chair of the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander
American Affairs.
Decades of racist policies
Chinese citizens began passing through San Francisco's then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the
Gold Rush of 1849.
By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from entering the country, with few
exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other
Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush's boom and the construction of the Transcontinental
Railroad.
At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to
internment camps, feared as the traitorous ""yellow peril"" after years of citizenship. Despite painful and
humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to engrain themselves in
the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans.
The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian American
success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other nations, namely
the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups, notably Black
Americans.
The logic went that if Asian Americans were doing so well, surely failure on the part of other ethnic groups
was their own fault.

Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees
followed by countless others who escaped Southeast Asia in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.
California Assemblymember David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and
chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian
Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.
""The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important,
but our issue hasn't gotten the attention it deserves,"" he said.
One small demographic victory for Asian Americans came in 1997 when President Bill Clinton directed the
Office of Management and Budget to expand its data classification system to break out ""Native Hawaiian or
Other Pacific Islanders"" from the Asian American group. That geographic list includes countries such as
Micronesia, Tonga, Vanuatu, Guam, the Marshall Islands and Fiji.
As a result, we know today that Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of COVID-19 deaths, behind Native
Americans and Black Americans.
A COVID-19 language barrier
Asian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin, Cantonese,
Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese and Hindi. The city's website notes that
COVID-19 information is available in English, Chinese, Filipino and Spanish.
Efforts by city health officials to inform Asian residents about COVID-19 safety precautions and testing in
their native languages have sometimes resulted in confusing or alienating translations.
For example, information about pop-up virus testing sites sometimes can come across as demands, while
in other cases the language is just plain confusing.
One flyer written in the Filipino language of Tagalog told people to ""cover their entire face,"" said Luisa
Antonio, executive director of the Bayanihan Equity Center, a Filipino American support group.
Department of Public Health officials declined an interview request about outreach efforts.
In California, about 5 million of 40million state residents are Asian American, and in three-quarters of
those homes, languages other than English are spoken regularly, according to the U.S. Census.
Even some Asian Americans who speak fluent English said government officials have not made it easy to
get information about the virus.
Huiting ""Rita"" Huang grew alarmed when her mother-in-law told her that there had been a positive
coronavirus case among the Chinese emigres to whom she was providing nursing services. The mother-in-
law was unsure what to do and feared her poor English would make getting information about where to get
tested even harder.
Huang felt confident she could help. Her English was solid and she had experience getting COVID-19
information as a project coordinator and health educator for the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health Coalition.
After pursuing a series of online testing-site leads through a variety of city- and community-run websites –
all requiring fluency in English – Huang soon learned that there were no available appointments at testing
facilities close to their neighborhood.
Huang eventually found a city-run testing site near Pier 30 along San Francisco Bay. The test was negative.

""José Alfredo Reyes’ wife and son pulled on personal protective gear and entered his San Diego hospital room.
'Can you hear us?' Margarita Reyes said. Her husband’s eyes remained shut, but his body twitched.
""She leaned in low to his ear and told him that his elderly mother, his children and his grandchildren would all be
OK. She told him she loved him.
""Ten minutes later, José Alfredo Reyes, 59, was dead.""
This is how our story on Latino farmworkers dying of COVID-19 begins. It is heartbreaking. Raw. Real. And a
story happening over and over all across the United States, but particularly in communities of color.
Journalists have been reporting this fact since the start of the pandemic. Communities of color have
disproportionately more cases, more hospitalizations, worse outcomes and more deaths. People of color make
up the majority in 62% of counties with the highest COVID-19 death rates, according to data compiled by USA
TODAY.
In pandemic stories, you'll read this phrase, ""COVID, which disproportionally impacts communities of color,.... ""
But this tragic fact deserves far more than a clause. We set out to trace the root causes. What systems, policies
or decisions created such risk?

Reporters detailed the redlining that clustered Black families around a chemical plant in Louisiana. The poor
working conditions that led to outbreaks among Latinos in California's Imperial Valley. The chronic and historic
neglect that created anemic Native American healthcare systems in New Mexico. The discrimination and
language barriers that stop Asian Americans from getting tested or seeking help in San Francisco. The housing
segregation that forced many Black families into cramped apartments, multigenerational homes and housing
projects in New Jersey.
What they found: Systemic racism was the common preexisting condition.
Deadly discrimination.
""Melvina Musket stared at her dying father through the cellphone screen. His mouth hung open, his eyes were
clamped shut and a beard covered his chin. She heard nurses crying in the background. 'Jesus is waiting for
you,' she told him.""
This is the lede of our story on the reasons behind the spread of COVID-19 in McKinley County, New Mexico. The
county ranks first in the state and sixth nationally for COVID deaths per capita. Roughly 74% of McKinley
County’s 71,367 residents are non-Hispanic Native American, mostly Navajo and Zuni.
A few weeks after Musket said those words to her father, he was dead. Her mother would die five days after
him.
""When people get sick with COVID now, they just talk about 'Well, they had preexisting conditions,'"" said Alan
Gomez, one of the reporters on the project wrapping up this week. ""The amazing thing was figuring out why and
going back in history and kind of putting together those dots, what they did 50, 60, 70, 80 years ago that set
these people up to have those diminished health conditions.""
Investigating the history that led us today was a challenge, so was getting people to tell their stories.
""A lot of people did not want to talk,"" said Marco Della Cava, who explored COVID in San Francisco's Asian
American community. ""There's a stigma associated with even suggesting you might have been near somebody
with COVID, it might imply your job would be in jeopardy, your immigration status.""
Rick Jervis contacted dozens of people impacted by COVID to get to the four or five who would talk with him in
Reserve, Louisiana, in an area known as ""Cancer Alley.""
The story of Karen Wilson sticks with him, because of how sudden it was. She was talking to her younger
brother, Jules Duhe, about having dinner, going to a New Orleans Saints game. ""And it was literally like one day
to the next he had trouble breathing. He goes to the hospital. Within days he was on a ventilator and that's the
last she ever heard from him,"" Jervis said.
""These are not just numbers on a page. These were actual humans who have lost people really, really close to
them. And that involves a lot of human pain. It was really tough to do.""
Reporter Deborah Berry saw the pain, but also found hope as she reported from Essex County, New Jersey.
""Despite the hurt and the fear, the pastors, the activists, the mayor, the funeral director, the tenant association
leaders, stepped up to help their communities, to help families, to help themselves,"" she said.
""There was power in that and hope in that. (Videojournalist Jarrad Henderson) and I cried with some of them,
but we also smiled and took deep breaths as we watched hundreds of city workers pack up food for families and
church volunteers line up people to get free testing. These communities are still struggling, yet they were
holding on to hope. We left hopeful.""

202006,"
SAN FRANCISCO – Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the
young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough.
""Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?"" asked Amy Rong.
The mother and daughter, along with Rong's parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-
occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways
are cramped; bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the spread of the highly contagious
novel coronavirus.
That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy's forehead, wondering if her child would
die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the
lone sofa bed.
In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless
night.

Getting tested didn't seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were expensive. Rong also
feared the reaction from neighbors. ""If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,"" she said. ""Everyone
would think you are the devil.""
It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts
a bustling Chinatown, as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians
and Filipinos also have made their homes here. All told, Asians in San Francisco represent upward of 20
countries.
But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with
the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 167 COVID-19 deaths reported by the San Francisco Department of
Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.
Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher
than the 13.5% reported, a byproduct of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes
this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused
segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing,
employment and health.
San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a
time when officials don't know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation's 16 million
coronavirus cases. About 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.
In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language
about testing, safety tips, housing and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the
community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line
employment and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.
""This model minority thing, that's not us,"" said Judy Young of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a San
Francisco nonprofit that helps area residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
""There is the language barrier and our community is small,"" Young said. ""So the city doesn't think we have any
problems, when we do.""
That risk of invisibility is only heightened by the pandemic. Since city health officials do not break down
COVID-19 statistics beyond ""Asian American,"" many advocates for the city's various groups said they are left to
speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities.
""There's this feeling that there's excess death out there,"" said Jeffrey Caballero of the nonprofit Association of
Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. ""That high mortality rate among Asian Americans means either
there isn't enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.""
What is the model minority myth?
For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the corrosive
and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California, San Francisco
professor of medicine.
Nguyen co-wrote a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to the
fact that 50% of San Francisco's 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans,
disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.
To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The
median annual income of households headed by the nation's 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060, compared

with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.

202006,"
Hi everyone! Welcome to the ""This is America"" newsletter. If you don't recognize my name, no worries, because
I'm new here! I'm Jenna Ryu, a Life and Travel editorial intern, and a senior at Georgetown University.
It's the jolly month of December, and we're still living in a revolutionary coronavirus pandemic caused by the so-
called ""China Virus,"" also known by its catchier moniker, ""Kung Flu.""
Funny, right? As punny as it sounds, this wordplay (along with the incessant bat jokes) is just one example of
the normalized racism that's come into the spotlight this year.
Often referred to as the model minority, Asian Americans are praised for things like economic success and work
ethic. The stereotypes: We're hard-working, but we don't bad-mouth the country. We economically outpace
others while staying polite and reserved. We worked our way up to the American Dream without publicly voicing
our struggles with prejudice, racism and discrimination along the way.
It feels like these microaggressions, xenophobia and the whole model minority myth have become normalized to
the point where they are overlooked. And in a year of so much reckoning – yet so much blatant racism against
Asian Americans – it has reached a breaking point for Asian Americans' mental health.
But first: Race and justice news we're watching

Black women and Latina entrepreneurs get less than 1% of venture capital
Gen Yeet: Some testimonies from jobless young adults, and a Q&A on why Gen Z is on Facebook
I should be flattered that I'm stereotyped as ""studious,"" right?
It seems like a compliment to be known as ""hard-working"" and ""good at math,"" right? Better than being
referred to as a ""thug"" or ""bad hombre.""
Here's the thing: The model minority myth inherently raises the standards for Asian Americans – both internally
and externally. It's assumed that because of how we look and where we're from, we should all be able to
achieve great feats without difficulty.
I feel an immense pressure to meet ridiculously high standards that are imposed on Asians, for the fear that if I
don't, I'm automatically ""dumb,"" ""disappointing"" and a ""failure."" Insecurity and self-doubt are all too familiar
when others express shock that math isn't my strong suit, or that my English is surprisingly ""good"" for an Asian.
Dr. Derek Iwamoto, an Asian American counseling psychologist, notes that some Asian Americans may ""crumble
under the pressure"" and experience depression and anxiety when failing to meet expectations such as attending
a prestigious university or becoming a successful doctor.
Asian Americans are three times less likely to seek mental health services compared with their white
counterparts, despite similar rates of depression and anxiety. Iwamoto attributes this not only to cultural
differences, but also the model minority trope, which encourages Asians to be successful while being
independent.
""If you believe all Asian Americans are successful, but you're Asian with unemployment issues, you might not
seek help because you feel you must be self-reliant,"" he said. ""It's hard to live up to an unrealistic notion to
achieve all of these things when it's really difficult given all the barriers Asian Americans experience.""
Asians are not exempt from racism
So let's talk about those ""barriers,"" as Iwamoto calls them.
Assumptions that we're intelligent and successful often overshadow a reality in which our cuisines are seen as
""weird"" and ""smelly,"" or that our eye shape is considered ugly for not conforming to Eurocentric beauty
standards. Worst of all, we're taught that these insensitive behaviors are less serious, and therefore more
acceptable.
When I've complained about those moments of harmful microaggressions, I've been told to shut up.
This summer, in a trend that spanned the country, students and alumni of color at my private high school turned
to Instagram to expose racism we'd experienced on campus.
My voice finally felt heard when I shared my story about a dorm head who made little effort during my first year
to learn my name and mistook me for another Asian girl for over a month.
But my pride in sharing was soon overshadowed. The faculty member's friends and family members began
invalidating my experience, questioning my authenticity and sarcastically mocking what happened and how it
made me feel.
Being told that the appropriate response to racism is to lighten up, laugh and stop being sensitive is a form of
gaslighting. If Asian Americans are so successful, then how could these jokes about eye shape or accents
actually be harmful?

202006,"
A series of violent crimes against Asians and Asian Americans has prompted activists and experts to warn that
racist rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic may be fueling a rise in hate incidents.
Police in Oakland, California, announced this week that they arrested a suspect in connection with a brutal
attack of a 91-year-old man in Chinatown that was caught on camera. In less than a week, a Thai man was
attacked and killed in San Francisco, a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in San Jose, and
a Filipino man was attacked with a box cutter on the subway in New York City.
It's unclear whether the crimes were racially motivated, but advocates calling for more to be done to address
violence against Asian Americans say racist crimes against the community are historically underreported for a
variety of reasons.
Meanwhile, police departments across the country are warning residents of increased crime around Lunar New
Year, in part because of the threat of robberies during the multi-day celebrations that begin Friday. Cash is a
customary gift.
Lunar New Year 2021: What does the ox symbolize, and how will it be celebrated during COVID-19 pandemic?
Violence against Asian Americans sharply increased in March as COVID-19 began spreading across the country,
and some politicians, including former President Donald Trump, blamed China for the pandemic, said Russell
Jeung, who created a tool that tracks hate incidents against Asian American Pacific Islander communities called
the Stop AAPI Hate tracker.
""When President Trump began and insisted on using the term 'China virus,' we saw that hate speech really led

to hate violence,"" said Jeung, chair of the Asian American studies department at San Francisco State University.
""That sort of political rhetoric and that sort of anti-Asian climate has continued to this day.""
Acts of racist violence lead to increased anxiety and fear in a population that already has higher rates of anxiety
and depression related to COVID-19 than other racial groups, Jeung said.
Stop AAPI Hate, Jeung's website, which includes a self-reporting tool for harassment, discrimination and violent
attacks, recorded 2,808 incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the U.S. from its inception on March 19 to
Dec. 31, 2020. Another organization, Asian Americans Advancing Justice - Asian American Justice Center,
recorded more than 3,000 hate incidents in their self-reporting system since late April 2020 – by far the highest
number in the tool's four-year history.
The FBI collects national hate crime data, but data for 2020 and 2021 has not yet been released. Two hundred
sixteen anti-Asian hate crimes were reported in 2019, according to the latest data available.
That number may be just a fraction of the true total given that fewer than half of the victims of a hate crime
ever report it to the police, according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
Jeung said the increase in hate incidents is a particular concern in urban areas. In New York City, police data
shows there were 24 anti-Asian hate crimes related to the coronavirus between Jan. 1 and Nov. 29, 2020,
compared with just three anti-Asian hate crimes in the same period in 2019.
""This increase was cultivated due to the anti-Asian rhetoric about the virus that was publicized, and individuals
began to attack Asian New Yorkers, either verbal attack or physical assault,"" Chief of Detectives Rodney
Harrison told reporters in August.
The spike in hate crimes led the NYPD to create an Asian Hate Crimes Task Force.
'We just want to be safe': Hate crimes, harassment of Asian Americans rise amid coronavirus pandemic
Activists including Amanda Nguyn, co-founder of Rise, a sexual assault survivor advocacy organization, are
raising awareness of the Oakland case and the other violent incidents involving Asian Americans. Nguyn said she
created an Instagram video about the attacks, which has since gone viral, because she was angered not only by
the violence but by the lack of media attention the cases received.
""When I made that video I was tired of living in fear and I wanted to scream,"" she told USA TODAY. ""It’s so
absurd that I have to say 'Stop killing us.' ... We are literally fearing for our lives as we walk out of our door, and
your silence, your silence rings through our heads.""
In the Oakland assault, the district attorney's office is investigating whether there is enough evidence to support
hate crime charges, Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said in a statement to USA TODAY.
The suspect in the Oakland assault, Yahya Muslim, was charged with three counts of assault, inflicting great
bodily injury and committing a crime against an elderly person, O'Malley announced at a news conference
Monday.
Police said Muslim is believed to have attacked a 60-year-old man and a 55-year-old woman the same day of
the Chinatown attack.
Meanwhile, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest
in the case and are donating that money to community organizations like Stop AAPI Hate.

""The skyrocketing number of hate crimes against Asian Americans continues to grow, despite our repeated
pleas for help,"" they said on Twitter. ""The crimes ignored and even excused.""
On Jan. 28, Vicha Ratanapakdee was attacked and later died in San Francisco. Eric Lawson, his son-in-law,
told USA TODAY he believes the 84-year-old was targeted because he was Asian. Lawson adde that his wife,
who is Thai, was verbally assaulted twice and told to ""go back to China"" before the attack.
""Everyone is dancing around the issue, and no one's addressing it,"" he said.
San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin filed murder and elder abuse charges against Antoine Watson,
but his office has ""no evidence of what motivated this senseless attack,"" spokesperson Rachel Marshall told
USA TODAY.
In San Jose, a 64-year-old Vietnamese woman was assaulted last Wednesday and robbed of $1,000 in cash
she had withdrawn for the holiday. No arrest has been made, and there is no indication the robbery was race-
related, said public information officer Sgt. Christian Camarillo.
That same day in New York, 61-year-old Noel Quintana, who is of reportedly Filipino descent, was slashed in
the face with a box cutter on the subway. Spokesperson Detective Sophia Mason told USA TODAY police were
investigating but did not answer questions about whether the incident may have been motivated by race.

Although it's unclear whether the particular cases are racially motivated, they are certainly ""related"" and
""horrific,"" Jeung said.
""What makes it worse is we see our elderly and youth also targeted,"" he said. ""It seems like people are
attacking vulnerable populations.""
John C. Yang, president and CEO of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC said his organization has been
tracking anti-Asian hate incidents and crimes for nearly 30 years and has received hundreds more hate
incident reports in 2020 than in previous years. He said polls by IPSOS and Pew Research Center indicate that
the true scope of hate Asian Americans are experiencing is probably much larger, and better data is needed.
""Although these reports are clearly incomplete, clearly just the tip of the iceberg that shows us that there is
this dramatic increase in hate incidents,"" he said, noting that it's too soon to tell if that increase is continuing
in 2021.
There are several reasons victims of a hate crime may not report it to the police, according to Yang.
Yang said victims may not be aware of the resources available for them, and there may be language barriers
to accessing those resources for older Asian Americans in particular. He said there may be cultural barriers to
reporting as well, including shame around being perceived as a victim. Some victims may also be concerned
about interacting with law enforcement because of their immigration status.
Yang added that not all hate incidents rise to the level of crime, but they still ""clearly inflict a level of mental
trauma."" He estimated that only about 10% of the incidents reported to his organization could be considered
crimes.

As an Asian American growing up in the United States, I experienced frequent insensitive racial questions: Do you
know kung fu? Why are your eyes like that? Where are you really from?
Now as an adult, I often receive outright racist remarks. For example, recently in my capacity as a practicing
physician treating hospitalized COVID-19 patients, I advocated for continued mask usage until a majority of our
fellow Americans are vaccinated. I received some vicious feedback: Go back to Wuhan. Stop being George Soros’
patsy. Shut up and let the real Americans talk.
None of this of course makes any sense — I was born in the United States and my family is from a region of China
over 600 miles away from Wuhan. This pandemic has led to more racism. I was thus pleasantly surprised and
excited that in their first few weeks, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have strongly denounced
the ongoing violence and hate crimes against Asian Americans and other minority groups.
Hate crimes grew during pandemic
The pair deserve praise for showing national leadership against this discrimination. Biden recently signed an
executive memorandum condemning “racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian American and Pacific
Islander” communities, and Biden and Harris released videos this month on the Lunar New Year to further bring
attention to these issues. This is in the context of increasing violence and hate crimes against Asian-Americans
across the nation during the pandemic.
For example, earlier this year, a 91-year-old Asian man in a California Chinatown was brutally attacked, while
another elderly man was attacked with a box cutter in New York. Stop AAPI Hate, a website that aggregates
reported incidents of hate crimes against Asian Americans, reports significant increases in the last 11 months, to
nearly 3,000 separate events.

WASHINGTON – Lawmakers representing groups of minority members of Congress and top House Democratic
leaders Friday denounced a ""crisis point"" of attacks against Asian Americans and called for action to prevent
future attacks.
Speaking at a virtual press conference, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairperson Rep. Judy Chu,
D-Calif., said the Asian American community had ""reached a crisis point that cannot be ignored"" amid reports of
a rise in violence and hate incidents against Asian Americans in the last several weeks.
Chu and other lawmakers said the attacks are part of a rise in anti-Asian American bias and xenophobia amid
the COVID-19 pandemic. Stop AAPI Hate, a group tracking anti-Asian discrimination, said it had received more
than 2,808 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate from mid-March 2020 through the end of 2020.
Many of the lawmakers speaking Friday laid the blame at the feet of leaders like former President Donald Trump,
who has blamed China for the pandemic and used derisive terms for the coronavirus. Advocates and Asian
American lawmakers warned the language would inflame anti-Asian American sentiment.
""What started as dirty looks and verbal assaults"" at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic had ""escalated to
physical attacks and violence against innocent Asian Americans,"" Chu said. ""Just as many Asian Americans were
preparing for the Lunar New Year over the past few weeks, we saw a surge in anti-Asian violence.""

Jeannie Mai never thought the Bay Area in California, where she grew up, was racist. ""The Real"" host just
thought it was a case of a few bad apples.
She remembers when her aunts and uncles left Vietnam and came to stay with her family, racist words were
spray-painted on their car and on the side of her family's home. But overall, the neighborhood was peaceful.
""It felt like we all coexisted,"" Mai, 42, says of her predominantly Hispanic and Black neighborhood. ""There just
might have been a few individuals that didn't understand our culture and why we were there.""
Flash forward to today, and there has been a rise in Asian-American attacks in the U.S. – including in the Bay
Area.
Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairperson Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif. and other lawmakers at a
virtual press conference last week said the attacks are part of a rise in anti-Asian American bias and xenophobia
amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
""What started as dirty looks and verbal assaults"" at the beginning of the pandemic ""escalated to physical attacks
and violence against innocent Asian Americans,"" Chu said. ""Just as many Asian Americans were preparing for
the Lunar New Year over the past few weeks, we saw a surge in anti-Asian violence.""
Chu cited several attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha
Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against senior citizens in Oakland, California's, Chinatown.
""I'm sickened to my stomach and filled with so much anger and pain, just when we're already aware of racist
attacks and our systemic racism that spawns across the world and especially in our country for our Black
brothers and sisters,"" Mai says. ""What have we not learned from 2020? And now why are we attacking our most

vulnerable that are already trying every day just to survive COVID?""
'Gran Torino' star Bee Vang speaks out: Vang criticizes film's racial slurs, 'mainstreamed anti-Asian racism'
Mai is using her platform – via her talk show, social media presence and media interviews – to speak out against
these attacks. The TV personality has 2.4 million followers on Instagram, 632,000 subscribers to her YouTube
channel ""Hello Hunnay with Jeannie Mai"" and nearly 260,000 followers on Twitter.
People may be following her for her outfits or YouTube content, but they'll also be getting a dose of hard news.
""This is something that should be everybody's business,"" Mai says.
Other celebrities are raising awareness, too.
Earlier this month, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information that
ultimately led to an arrest in the case of an Oakland assault.
Mai is proud of her ""Asian brothers and sisters"" for making their voices heard.
She emphasizes that racism doesn't just impact the Asian community, but Asians should be included in
conversations about curbing racist behaviors.
""For everybody, not just the Asian community, racism and hate are pandemics that we have to fight to
eradicate,"" she says. ""But it starts with listening to our communities of color, planning and organizing to
support, speaking out about the problems and being active about the solution. You can't stand for (Black Lives
Matter), and then sit there sedentary about Asian attacks.""
Important: Here's why 'Minari' is truly an American story, even if the Golden Globes disagree
She doesn't think white Americans are educated enough about Asian history or culture – but she doesn't think
she's educated enough about Black history or culture either
""I don't think our school system is catered around educating us what we really need to know,"" she says.
She does, however, believe that racism can be unlearned. ""I believe racism is taught,"" she says. ""And it may not
be your parents sitting you down telling you specifically like, 'Don't trust those Asians. Don't be friends with
Black people.' No, I think it's in every grain of your upbringing.""
Mai's parents immigrated to the U.S. from Vietnam and escaped communism to come to a safer place.
""I've always been taught to just stay quiet, don't be the one to cause issues,"" she says.
She wants her community to know that they have a voice and need to protect one another, even if they don't
speak each other's languages. Beyond that, they should stand up for all their neighbors, too.
Mai is pleased that more Asian Americans have been appearing on television in series like ""Bling Empire"" on
Netflix and ""House of Ho"" on HBO Max. But she also wants to see programming that breaks away from the plot
points that fueled the mega hit movie ""Crazy Rich Asians.""
""Hollywood has this way of taking a stereotype and then marketing it down to the ground,"" she says. ""I would
just hope to see also a diverse depiction of what Asian Americans can look like, because not all of them are
crazy or rich.""

202006,"
BERGEN COUNTY, N.J. - Yena Choe, 16, was at Times Square on Saturday with six friends to film a video for the
Korean-American Association of New Jersey's ""Samiljeol"" event, a remembrance of Korean resistance to
Japanese rule.
As they walked with Korean flags, an unmasked, middle-aged woman glared at the teens and told them, ""Get
away from me. Stay far away from me,"" while waving her hands, Choe said.
""We did nothing to provoke this woman,"" said the Leonia High School sophomore, who said she and her friends
were all wearing double face masks. ""Yet based on our appearance, and quite possibly even based on the flags
flying in our hands, we were treated as if we were a contagious disease.
""For the rest of the day, I was afraid,"" she said. ""I was afraid that something like that could happen again, that
next time it could be worse than a glare and a rude remark.""
Days later in the city's Chinatown, Salman Muflihi was arrested after allegedly stabbing a 36-year-old Asian
man, police said. Muflihi is facing charges of attempted murder as a hate crime, assault as a hate crime, forgery
and criminal possession of a weapon, according to New York Police Department statements to USA TODAY on
Friday.
The incident is a part of a series of recent violent crimes against Asians and Asian Americans in New York and
across the country.
New York Mayor Bill de Blasio and the commander of the police department's Asian Hate Crime Task Force spoke

at a news conference Tuesday about what the city is doing to prevent anti-Asian hate crimes.
""An attack on Asian New Yorkers is an attack on all of us,"" de Blasio said.
Last year, there were 28 incidents of COVID-19 related hate crimes against Asians in New York and two so far in
2021, according to Deputy Inspector of the city's Anti-Asian Hate Crimes Task Force Stewart Loo.
A string of high-profile attacks on Asian Americans are surfacing from coast to coast a year into the pandemic.
In January, an 84-year-old San Francisco immigrant from Thailand died after he was shoved to the ground on
his morning walk. In February, a Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in San Jose and a
Filipino man was slashed with a box cutter on the subway in New York City.
The head of Oakland's Chinatown Chamber of Commerce has collected more than 20 incident reports and videos
of small businesses getting robbed and owners and customers assaulted, he told San Francisco's KGO-TV.
Attacks like these have continued despite President Biden's executive order banning the federal government
from using racist language to discuss the pandemic, a turnaround from months of his predecessor mocking the
""China virus"" and ""kung flu.""
Around the world, as coronavirus has devastated the economy, Asians have become targeted for the pandemic
that started in Wuhan, China. They have been yelled at, spat on and beaten up, according to media reports
across the globe.
Perpetual foreigner
In Wyckoff, New Jersey, last June, a Chinese restaurant was vandalized with the words ""coronavirus"" and ""go
home"" spray-painted on the windows and sidewalk.
North Jersey is home to one of the state's largest populations of Asian Americans with 17% of Bergen County
identifying as Asian. In towns such as Leonia and Fort Lee, Asian Americans make up about 40% of the
community.
There were 47 race-based incidents against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in New Jersey from March 19
through Dec. 31, the eighth most of any state, according to the advocacy group Stop AAPI Hate. Of the cases,
64% were verbal attacks while 13% were physical assaults. In New York City, 259 incidents were recorded
against Asian Americans in the same period with 81% being verbal and 12% physical.
Burdened by the model minority myth, Asians are easy targets in times of downturn, said Russell Jeung, co-
founder of Stop AAPI Hate and professor at San Francisco State University. Despite their deep roots in the U.S.
Asian Americans will forever be considered foreigners by some people, he said, a stereotype that has persisted
since the first immigration of Asians in the 19th century to help build the Transcontinental Railroad.
""Since we don't belong, we can be spat on,"" Jeung said.
U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, who represents New Jersey's Third District, says the hate crimes seen over the past weeks
are reprehensible.
""Seeing our elders targeted and attacked has been hard to watch and difficult to explain to my two boys,"" said
Kim, whose sons are 3 and 5. ""New Jersey has been a place where generations of Asian immigrants have found
open arms and incredible opportunities.
""We cannot put an end to this hate until we see tangible results at all levels of government and society,"" Kim
said. He called for executive actions from the administration and legislation from Congress.

Asian community activists in New Jersey are aware of the rise in hate crimes. While they are vigilant and
cautious, they feel the Garden State is a welcoming place for immigrants.
""We are in a much better situation than in New York City,"" said Michelle Song, executive vice president of the
Korean-American Association, who lives in Somerset. New Jersey values diversity, said Song, who emigrated
from South Korea in 1995. It's also a suburban environment where automobiles are the main mode of
transportation, she said, leaving fewer chances for random encounters that can flare into harassment.
""We hardly walk here, we don't see people face to face,"" added Kirby Tan, a Chinese community group
organizer who lives in Tenafly.
Tan has lived in New Jersey for 35 years. After arriving from Malaysia to study in San Diego at a time when
there were few Asians, he recalls developing a buddy system for safety when he went outside. His
neighborhood in Tenafly is populated with many Asian American families and there is a sense of community,
Tan said.
A history of outcasts
As businesses have shut down, Asians have become a convenient scapegoat for troubles. It has happened
before: Consider the 1982 case of Chinese American Vincent Chin, who was beaten to death by two
autoworkers who were frustrated at losing jobs because of competition from Japanese car manufacturers.
Following a plea bargain, the men received no jail time. “These weren’t the kind of men you send to jail,”
wrote Michigan Judge Charles Kaufman.
This month, Congress' Asian Pacific American Caucus held a day of remembrance on the 79th anniversary of
President Franklin D. Roosevelt ordering more than 100,000 Japanese Americans into internment camps
during World War II, another dark period in this country’s history.
Meanwhile, the young American-born sons of Japanese immigrants – known as Nisei –were eager to show
their patriotism and shed racist stereotypes. They volunteered to serve in the military during the war. But
again, the government distrusted them, so they weren’t allowed to serve in the Pacific. The estimated 33,000
Japanese American soldiers were sent to serve in Europe to fight for the U.S., even as many of their families
were held in internment camps.
The Nisei soldiers became known for their bravery. The 100th/442nd Infantry Regiment was comprised
almost entirely of second-generation Japanese Americans, and they became the most decorated unit of its
size in U.S. military history.
Choe is well aware that while born in this country, she is still sometimes perceived as an outsider.
""As angry as I was, I was hesitant to respond,"" she said of the Times Square incident. ""The videos and
images of violent anti-Asian hate crimes that I had seen on the news and on social media rushed through my
head, making me feel almost embarrassed, almost scared to hold the flag of my own ancestors.""
Choe blames social media and comments from elected officials, including former President Donald Trump,
who seemed to direct responsibility for the global pandemic toward Asians.
""Looking back, I wish I would have said something,"" Choe said. ""I wish I didn't have to feel scared about
standing up for myself. But this is the sad reality of the injustices that continuously face Asian Americans in
our society.""

202006,"
DENVER – Helen Oh was walking down the sidewalk of the downtown 16th Street pedestrian mall in April when two young men approached from the other
direction.
The coronavirus pandemic had been spreading in the United States for a month, and Asian American community groups were warning of a disconcerting surge
of hateful and racist language directed toward them, tied to the virus’ origins in China. Oh, an attorney, was on her guard.
The two men drew closer.
“Infected and disgusting,” one called out as they passed, she said.
Heart racing, she ducked into a drugstore.
“I didn't think to say anything back when I heard it,"" she said. ""It really only sunk in as I was walking away.""
Stepping back onto the street, Oh, 30, walked toward her car as an older couple approached. The woman made a show of detouring around her, she said.
“The woman literally walked off the sidewalk to be as far from me as possible,” Oh said. “There was no one else around and it was so obnoxious.”
One incident, she might have written off as the kind of casual racism she has encountered all her life as the daughter of Korean immigrants. But two, in such a
short time? It was clear, she said, that she was being targeted because she is Asian.
“You could feel the sense of hatred and scapegoating that was being built,” Oh said. “I avoided going out by myself for a while.""
Asian Americans across the United States are reporting a significant increase in hate crimes, harassment and discrimination tied to the spread of the COVID-19
pandemic. More than a year after these attacks began, the pandemic has galvanized Asian Americans, many of whom have long felt invisible, to speak out
about the hatred and racism being directed their way.
Community leaders are calling for greater enforcement of existing hate-crime laws, better connections with local police departments charged with investigating
hateful incidents, and other Americans to consider the impact of their words and actions on the country’s estimated 21 million Asian Americans. Asian American
entertainers are using their platforms to highlight the issues, Asian American journalists are sharing their own stories of discrimination on social media and a
growing chorus of federal lawmakers are demanding action.
The pandemic has especially “struck a nerve” for the Asian American community, which has forced many to realize that simple discrimination can turn violent,
said Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who is a member of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. The fight against the “bamboo ceiling” is now
also about physical safety, he said.
“For a large number of Asian Americans, especially the young generation, they’re now seeing for the first time actual violence directed at them or their
grandparents,” Lieu said. “It’s highly disturbing.”
In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the attacks – and without naming them, criticizing former President Donald Trump and
other federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the “China virus” or the “Kung flu.” The order calls for better data collection about hateful
incidents, and mandates federal agencies to fight “racism, xenophobia, and intolerance” directed at Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, or AAPI.
“The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including
references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin,” Biden said in his order. “Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and
perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI
persons.”

Among recent incidents: In January, an 84-year-old Thai American man was brutally shoved in San Francisco and later died. That same month, police in
Oakland, California, said a young man shoved three elderly people to the ground from behind in the city's Chinatown neighborhood, knocking out one. And this
week, a 36-year old Asian man in New York’s Chinatown neighborhood was stabbed and taken to a hospital in critical condition. The suspect in that assault
faces charges that include attempted murder as a hate crime and assault as a hate crime, among other charges, the New York Police Department said.
The surge in hate incidents against the Asian American community since the start of the pandemic was set aflame last winter when Trump began scapegoating
Chinese people for the explosion of coronavirus in the United States.
“It gave a lot of people permission (to act on) their prejudice,” said Mabel Menard, president of OCA Chicago, a chapter of OCA, a Washington, D.C.-based
nonprofit that advocates for civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.
The racism and discrimination accompanying the pandemic comes atop the devastation the disease has had on some portions of the Asian and Pacific Islander
community, including health-related business closures and the deaths of at least 67 Filipino registered nurses – a staggering 31% of all nursing deaths, even
though Filipinos make up only 4% of registered nurses in the United States, according to National Nurses United. Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of
coronavirus deaths, behind Native Americans and Black Americans.
More data on Asian hate crimes needed
The San Francisco-based group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander attacks, and other community groups, such as Asian
Americans Advancing Justice, based in Washington, D.C., have collectively recorded more than 3,000 anti-Asian attacks nationwide since March, when the
COVID-19 pandemic exploded onto U.S. shores. That’s compared to about 100 such incidents that community trackers have recorded annually in the years
prior, said Cynthia Choi, 54, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.
Because communities of color are often scapegoated during national crises, “we knew it was going to get bad very quickly,” Choi said, “and we wanted to
document it in order to understand the severity of it, who was being targeted, where and the magnitude of this problem so we could develop effective
responses.”
The group tracks reports from 47 states plus the District of Columbia. California accounts for roughly 40% of all incidents, where nearly a third of all Asian
Americans live, Choi said. Among cities with large Asian communities, the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York City have the highest numbers of incidents.
Many Asian immigrants who fled to the United States to avoid dictatorship or Communist rule consider the casual racism they encounter to be the price of
admission to this country, said Cat Shieh, an anti-hate coordinator with Asian Americans Advancing Justice of Chicago.
And while roughly 90% of the incidents don’t rise to the level of criminally prosecutable hate crimes, “they’re dehumanizing,” Choi said.
“It’s been a cold, sobering reminder that regardless of your immigration status, how many generations you’ve been here, we continue to have conditional status
and to be 'otherized,'” she said.
More recently, a series of high-profile incidents captured on video by bystanders helped bring fresh awareness to hateful attacks on Asian Americans, including
the 84-year-old Thai American man’s death, which went viral on social media. It spurred the creation of Compassion in Oakland, a group of hundreds of
volunteers who now help chaperone elderly Asian American community members on errands.
A federal report released last week warned that at least 40% of hate crimes and bias-motivated incidents went unreported to authorities, and that victims
commonly said it's a low priority for police to investigate.
The report published by the Justice Department’s Hate Crimes Enforcement and Prevention Initiative pointed out that 87% of police agencies participating in
the FBI's voluntary Hate Crime Statistics said they had no hate crimes in 2017, even though that's statistically unlikely.
The report compared data from a national crime victim survey to federal statistics, highlighting that while there was an average of 204,600 hate crimes
experienced by the public, only 7,500 victims were counted by the FBI because the incidents were either not reported to police, not investigated by officers, or
not submitted to the national database. The report, based on data from 2009 through 2017, urged law enforcement leaders to emphasize to frontline officers
that hate crimes should be taken as seriously as shooting, assaults, rapes, robberies or school violence.
Because federal hate-crime data takes time to collect, the FBI has not yet released official statistics about hate-related incidents nationally for 2020.
Compounding the difficulty: States often use different criteria to categorize incidents. Federal officials only began tracking hate crimes in the 1990s.
Despite the lack of data, some police departments and law enforcement agencies are already responding. The NYPD last year created an Asian hate crimes task
force, and Oakland police assigned a new liaison officer to the city’s Chinatown neighborhood. New York state Attorney General Letitia James launched a hotline
for victims to report harassment or intimidation, and on Monday, California allocated $1.4 million to track anti-Asian bias and hate crimes through the Stop AAPI
Hate tracking group.
In Houston, police have seen little evidence of an increase in hate crimes directed at Asian Americans, said Lt. Kevin Gallier, who oversees the hate crimes unit
for the country’s fourth-largest city. Gallier said his unit reviews every report taken by an officer where there’s an indication of racial motivations. Police officers,
he said, sometimes see “awful but lawful” speech – hate speech isn’t illegal and a racial slur isn’t necessarily a crime unless it causes someone to feel
specifically at risk of harm.
""Even when it's not welcome speech, you're still able to say what you want in many cases,"" said Gallier, 52. “But thoughts lead to words, and sometimes words
lead to actions, and those actions can become criminal.""
A long history of racism against Asians
Asian Americans have long faced discrimination and hate crimes in the United States, including the Chinese Exclusion Act, which in 1882 banned Chinese
immigrants from entering the country.
During World War II, the federal government imprisoned about 120,000 American citizens of Japanese descent solely because of their race, destroying

communities across California, Washington and Oregon by forcing business owners to shutter their doors and residents to give up their homes, and locking
them up in “relocation centers” in rural areas of Colorado and Wyoming, among others.
In addition to federally sanctioned discrimination, the Asian American community has long suffered hate crimes that remain bitterly remembered, including
attacks by members of the white supremacist group Order of Caucasians, who murdered four Chinese men – tying them up and dousing them with kerosene
to burn them to death – in the early 1800s in Chico, California.
More recently, the brutal 1982 baseball-bat murder of Chinese American autoworker Vincent Chin by two white autoworkers in Detroit who were allegedly
upset about competition from Japanese automakers prompted the creation of the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which now has chapters
nationally.
And for years, the stereotype of an Asian carrying cash resulted in Asian Americans being targeted for robberies and carjackings, which by and large aren't
categorized as hate crimes despite their racial element, said Debbie Chen, OCA’s executive vice president and a civil engagement programs director for the
greater Houston chapter.
Today, Asian American leaders are urging their community to report any incidents, even those that might not meet the bar for prosecution, and regardless of
personal embarrassment or lack of details, such as the perpetrator’s identity.
Assailants have historically often targeted women, people over 60 years old and limited English proficient immigrants, considering them easier targets,
according to experts.
""Before COVID-19 had even hit us in New York, we had already seen our members and small businesses fight the pandemic of anti-Asian hatred,” said U.S.
Rep. Grace Meng, a New York Democrat.
For Hong Lee, 35, declining a man’s offer to get lunch led to her public humiliation as he spewed vulgarities. She had been on a lunch break last August
waiting to order at her regular Mexican spot in Los Angeles’ Koreatown neighborhood.
On the Instagram video, which garnered millions of views, the man is seen cursing at Lee, who is Vietnamese American, as she cries and begs bystanders to
intercede.
“Can you help me?” she asks repeatedly, as he calls her an Asian f*ck.
“Yeah, help her, help her go back to f*cking Asia,” the man screams, his 6’3"" frame physically towering over her.
As patrons and restaurant workers stood and stared, Lee turned on her camera, fearful that the man would corner her and turn violent.
In an interview this week with USA TODAY, Lee said, “I’ve never been told to go back to Asia. I’m an American.”
Something else bothered her.
“At no point in time did anyone in the restaurant come up to ask me if I was OK, if I needed anything, never once acknowledged my existence, there was a
definite lack of sympathy and compassion,” said Lee, even after the man left.
For a month or so after the hate incident, her life was a blur of paranoia, insomnia and fear, she said. When she finally felt more like herself, she realized the
level of trauma and PTSD she had been dealing with whenever she left home.
The video spurred other victims of the same alleged assailant to come forward to police, and Lee is now a county ambassador for an anti-Asian hate
program, helping other victims tell their stories.
Myth of 'model minority' harms Asians, others
Many Asian Americans feel their communities have long been ignored by mainstream politics, media and entertainment, especially when coupled with the
myth of Asians as a “model minority” who are more successful than Blacks or Latinos.
That myth has long been used by white Americans to pit and separate Asian Americans from other people of color, and to justify institutional racism. It may
also account for the fact that according to one of the few existing research reports on anti-Asian hate, published this January in the U.S. National Library of
Medicine, Asian Americans have a relatively higher chance than Blacks or Latinos of experiencing hate crimes perpetrated by non-white offenders.
The report found that despite hate crimes against Asian Americans being on the rise, studies rarely look at such incidents. They are “largely ignored"" by
researchers, and as a result the nature and characteristics of the offenders, victims and situations are largely unknown, the report says.
“The outrage, the decrying of these recent incidents, is because of centuries of invisibility, of feeling like the history of anti-Asian racism is not known, that
what happens to our community is minimized, is overlooked,” said Choi, of Stop AAPI Hate.
Compounding the challenge, the Asian American community is not monolithic. Instead, it’s broad and encompasses people who trace their ancestry from
China, Japan, the Philippines, Korea and other countries, all with their own distinct languages and cultures.
Shieh, of Asian Americans Advancing Justice of Chicago, said it’s often hard to persuade victims of racial harassment or hate crimes to come to police
because they speak a language other than English, or worry about their immigration status. Chicago alone has 19 separate Asian communities.
""We're not even a singular group that can unite,” said Shieh, 28. “We forget that our country is not necessarily a black-and-white paradigm or dichotomy.""
Chen, of OCA, said Asian immigrants might worry about causing ""trouble.""
“They're being targeted as Asians because they (perpetrators) don’t think Asians are going to make as big as a fuss. It goes along with the stereotype that
Asians are less likely to be vocal about things,” Chen said. “That’s changing as we have more and more young people growing up here, but so long as your

202006,"
DENVER – Helen Oh was walking down the sidewalk of the downtown 16th Street pedestrian mall in April when
two young men approached from the other direction.
The coronavirus pandemic had been spreading in the United States for a month, and Asian American community
groups were warning of a disconcerting surge of hateful and racist language directed toward them, tied to the
virus' origins in China. Oh, an attorney, was on her guard.
The two men drew closer.
""Infected and disgusting,"" one called out as they passed, she said.
Heart racing, she ducked into a drugstore.
""I didn't think to say anything back when I heard it,"" she said. ""It really only sunk in as I was walking away.""
Stepping back onto the street, Oh, 30, walked toward her car as an older couple approached. The woman made

a show of detouring around her, she said.
""The woman literally walked off the sidewalk to be as far from me as possible,"" Oh said. ""There was no one else
around and it was so obnoxious.""
One incident, she might have written off as the kind of casual racism she has encountered all her life as the
daughter of Korean immigrants. But two, in such a short time? It was clear, she said, that she was being
targeted because she is Asian.
""You could feel the sense of hatred and scapegoating that was being built,"" Oh said. ""I avoided going out by
myself for a while.""
Asian Americans across the United States are reporting a significant increase in hate crimes, harassment and
discrimination tied to the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a year after these attacks began, the
pandemic has galvanized Asian Americans, many of whom have long felt invisible, to speak out about the hatred
and racism being directed their way.
Community leaders are calling for greater enforcement of existing hate-crime laws, better connections with local
police departments charged with investigating hateful incidents, and other Americans to consider the impact of
their words and actions on the country's estimated 21 million Asian Americans. Asian American entertainers are
using their platforms to highlight the issues, Asian American journalists are sharing their own stories of
discrimination on social media and a growing chorus of federal lawmakers are demanding action.
The pandemic has especially ""struck a nerve"" for the Asian American community, which has forced many to
realize that simple discrimination can turn violent, said Democratic Rep. Ted Lieu of California, who is a member
of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus. The fight against the ""bamboo ceiling"" is now also about
physical safety, he said.
""For a large number of Asian Americans, especially the young generation, they're now seeing for the first time
actual violence directed at them or their grandparents,"" Lieu said. ""It's highly disturbing.""
In January, President Joe Biden issued an executive order condemning the attacks – and without naming them,
criticizing former President Donald Trump and other federal officials who repeatedly referred to COVID-19 as the
""China virus"" or the ""Kung flu."" The order calls for better data collection about hateful incidents, and mandates
federal agencies to fight ""racism, xenophobia, and intolerance"" directed at Asian Americans and Pacific
Islanders, or AAPI.
""The federal government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments
through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic
location of its origin,"" Biden said in his order. ""Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated
stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying,
harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons.""
Among recent incidents: In January, an 84-year-old Thai American man was brutally shoved in San Francisco
and later died. That same month, police in Oakland, California, said a young man shoved three elderly people to
the ground from behind in the city's Chinatown neighborhood, knocking out one. And this week, a 36-year old
Asian man in New York's Chinatown neighborhood was stabbed and taken to a hospital in critical condition. The
suspect in that assault faces charges that include attempted murder as a hate crime and assault as a hate
crime, among other charges, the New York Police Department said.
The surge in hate incidents against the Asian American community since the start of the pandemic was set
aflame last winter when Trump began scapegoating Chinese people for the explosion of coronavirus in the
United States.

""It gave a lot of people permission (to act on) their prejudice,"" said Mabel Menard, president of OCA Chicago,
a chapter of OCA, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that advocates for civil rights of Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders.
The racism and discrimination accompanying the pandemic comes atop the devastation the disease has had
on some portions of the Asian and Pacific Islander community, including health-related business closures and
the deaths of at least 67 Filipino registered nurses – a staggering 31% of all nursing deaths, even though
Filipinos make up only 4% of registered nurses in the United States, according to National Nurses United.
Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of coronavirus deaths, behind Native Americans and Black Americans.
More data on Asian
hate crimes needed
The San Francisco-based group Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander
attacks, and other community groups, such as Asian Americans Advancing Justice, based in Washington,
D.C., have collectively recorded more than 3,000 anti-Asian attacks nationwide since March, when the
COVID-19 pandemic exploded onto U.S. shores. That's compared to about 100 such incidents that community
trackers have recorded annually in the years prior, said Cynthia Choi, 54, a co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate.
Because communities of color are often scapegoated during national crises, ""we knew it was going to get bad
very quickly,"" Choi said, ""and we wanted to document it in order to understand the severity of it, who was
being targeted, where and the magnitude of this problem so we could develop effective responses.""
The group tracks reports from 47 states plus the District of Columbia. California accounts for roughly 40% of
all incidents, where nearly a third of all Asian Americans live, Choi said. Among cities with large Asian
communities, the Bay Area, Los Angeles and New York City have the highest numbers of incidents.
Many Asian immigrants who fled to the United States to avoid dictatorship or Communist rule consider the
casual racism they encounter to be the price of admission to this country, said Cat Shieh, an anti-hate
coordinator with Asian Americans Advancing Justice of Chicago.
And while roughly 90% of the incidents don't rise to the level of criminally prosecutable hate crimes, ""they're
dehumanizing,"" Choi said.
""It's been a cold, sobering reminder that regardless of your immigration status, how many generations you've
been here, we continue to have conditional status and to be 'otherized,'"" she said.
More recently, a series of high-profile incidents captured on video by bystanders helped bring fresh awareness
to hateful attacks on Asian Americans, including the 84-year-old Thai American man's death, which went viral
on social media. It spurred the creation of Compassion in Oakland, a group of hundreds of volunteers who
now help chaperone elderly Asian American community members on errands.
A federal report released last week warned that at least 40% of hate crimes and bias-motivated incidents
went unreported to authorities, and that victims commonly said it's a low priority for police to investigate.
The report published by the Justice Department's Hate Crimes Enforcement and Prevention Initiative pointed
out that 87% of police agencies participating in the FBI's voluntary Hate Crime Statistics said they had no
hate crimes in 2017, even though that's statistically unlikely.
The report compared data from a national crime victim survey to federal statistics, highlighting that while
there was an average of 204,600 hate crimes experienced by the public, only 7,500 victims were counted by
the FBI because the incidents were either not reported to police, not investigated by officers, or not
submitted to the national database. The report, based on data from 2009 through 2017, urged law

enforcement leaders to emphasize to frontline officers that hate crimes should be taken as seriously as
shooting, assaults, rapes, robberies or school violence.
Because federal hate-crime data takes time to collect, the FBI has not yet released official statistics about
hate-related incidents nationally for 2020. Compounding the difficulty: States often use different criteria to
categorize incidents. Federal officials only began tracking hate crimes in the 1990s.
Despite the lack of data, some police departments and law enforcement agencies are already responding.
The NYPD last year created an Asian hate crimes task force, and Oakland police assigned a new liaison
officer to the city's Chinatown neighborhood. New York state Attorney General Letitia James launched a
hotline for victims to report harassment or intimidation, and on Monday, California allocated $1.4 million to
track anti-Asian bias and hate crimes through the Stop AAPI Hate tracking group.
In Houston, police have seen little evidence of an increase in hate crimes directed at Asian Americans, said
Lt. Kevin Gallier, who oversees the hate crimes unit for the country's fourth-largest city. Gallier said his unit
reviews every report taken by an officer where there's an indication of racial motivations. Police officers, he
said, sometimes see ""awful but lawful"" speech – hate speech isn't illegal and a racial slur isn't necessarily a
crime unless it causes someone to feel specifically at risk of harm.
""Even when it's not welcome speech, you're still able to say what you want in many cases,"" said Gallier, 52.
""But thoughts lead to words, and sometimes words lead to actions, and those actions can become
criminal.""
A long history of racism
against Asians
Asian Americans have long faced discrimination and hate crimes in the United States, including the Chinese
Exclusion Act, which in 1882 banned Chinese immigrants from entering the country.
During World War II, the federal government imprisoned about 120,000 American citizens of Japanese
descent solely because of their race, destroying communities across California, Washington and Oregon by
forcing business owners to shutter their doors and residents to give up their homes, and locking them up
in ""relocation centers"" in rural areas of Colorado and Wyoming, among others.
In addition to federally sanctioned discrimination, the Asian American community has long suffered hate
crimes that remain bitterly remembered, including attacks by members of the white supremacist group
Order of Caucasians, who murdered four Chinese men – tying them up and dousing them with kerosene to
burn them to death – in the early 1800s in Chico, California.
More recently, the brutal 1982 baseball-bat murder of Chinese American autoworker Vincent Chin by two
white autoworkers in Detroit who were allegedly upset about competition from Japanese automakers
prompted the creation of the nonprofit Asian Americans Advancing Justice, which now has chapters
nationally.
And for years, the stereotype of an Asian carrying cash resulted in Asian Americans being targeted for
robberies and carjackings, which by and large aren't categorized as hate crimes despite their racial
element, said Debbie Chen, OCA's executive vice president and a civil engagement programs director for
the greater Houston chapter.
Today, Asian American leaders are urging their community to report any incidents, even those that might
not meet the bar for prosecution, and regardless of personal embarrassment or lack of details, such as the
perpetrator's identity.

Assailants have historically often targeted women, people over 60 years old and limited English
proficient immigrants, considering them easier targets, according to experts.
""Before COVID-19 had even hit us in New York, we had already seen our members and small businesses
fight the pandemic of anti-Asian hatred,"" said U.S. Rep. Grace Meng, a New York Democrat.
For Hong Lee, 35, declining a man's offer to get lunch led to her public humiliation as he spewed
vulgarities. She had been on a lunch break last August waiting to order at her regular Mexican spot in
Los Angeles' Koreatown neighborhood.
On the Instagram video, which garnered millions of views, the man is seen cursing at Lee, who is
Vietnamese American, as she cries and begs bystanders to intercede.
""Can you help me?"" she asks repeatedly, as he calls her an Asian f*ck.
""Yeah, help her, help her go back to f*cking Asia,"" the man screams, his 6'3"" frame physically towering
over her.
As patrons and restaurant workers stood and stared, Lee turned on her camera, fearful that the man
would corner her and turn violent.
In an interview this week with USA TODAY, Lee said, ""I've never been told to go back to Asia. I'm an
American.""
Something else bothered her.
""At no point in time did anyone in the restaurant come up to ask me if I was OK, if I needed anything,
never once acknowledged my existence, there was a definite lack of sympathy and compassion,"" said
Lee, even after the man left.
For a month or so after the hate incident, her life was a blur of paranoia, insomnia and fear, she said.
When she finally felt more like herself, she realized the level of trauma and PTSD she had been dealing
with whenever she left home.
The video spurred other victims of the same alleged assailant to come forward to police, and Lee is now
a county ambassador for an anti-Asian hate program, helping other victims tell their stories.
Myth of 'model minority'
harms Asians, others
Many Asian Americans feel their communities have long been ignored by mainstream politics, media and
entertainment, especially when coupled with the myth of Asians as a ""model minority"" who are more
successful than Blacks or Latinos.
That myth has long been used by white Americans to pit and separate Asian Americans from other
people of color, and to justify institutional racism. It may also account for the fact that according to one
of the few existing research reports on anti-Asian hate, published this January in the U.S. National
Library of Medicine, Asian Americans have a relatively higher chance than Blacks or Latinos of
experiencing hate crimes perpetrated by non-white offenders.
The report found that despite hate crimes against Asian Americans being on the rise, studies rarely look
at such incidents. They are ""largely ignored"" by researchers, and as a result the nature and
characteristics of the offenders, victims and situations are largely unknown, the report says.

202006,"
WASHINGTON – It has been over a year since Asian American lawmakers first sounded the alarm on a potential
rise in anti-Asian hate and violence amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since then, Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks discrimination against Asian and Pacific Island Americans, said it
received more than 3,000 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian American harassment or attacks compared to roughly
100 incidents annually in previous years.
In the beginning, Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said it was ""important"" to condemn the hate incidents, even if it was
""symbolic."" But as the incidents continued to rise, ""it's time to take it to the next level to make sure that we are
using all the tools in our toolbox to help curb this problem,"" she said.
That includes legislation.
Democratic lawmakers said they would introduce a new bill addressing a rise in hate incidents directed at Asian
Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. The bill, a revised version of legislation introduced but not passed in
the last Congress, would create a new position at the Department of Justice to facilitate the review of hate
crimes and provide oversight of hate crimes related to COVID-19.
Meng, the lead sponsor of the legislation in the House, told USA TODAY the bill would make it ""easier for us to
have a more complete and accurate picture"" of hate crimes and incidents.
Among other provisions, it would issue guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies to establish their
own hate crime reporting systems and education campaigns about hate crimes, provided in multiple languages.

A San Antonio man whose restaurant was vandalized with racist graffiti days after he criticized Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's decision to rescind a statewide mask
mandate says he has no regrets and will continue to speak out.
Mike Nguyen appeared on CNN last week, saying his stance was based on the safety of his staff, himself and the community. Since that interview, he said he has
faced death threats on social media. On Sunday, Nguyen arrived at his Noodle Tree restaurant to find ""no mask,"" ""go back 2 China"" and other hateful messages
scrawled in red paint on his storefront.
""I was born here and I'm not Chinese,"" Nguyen, whose background is half Vietnamese and half French, told USA TODAY on Monday. ""It's not right that as an
American I can't state my opinion without being attacked.""
A string of attacks against Asian Americans has rattled California's Bay Area: This group of 700 volunteers is taking action
More than 535,000 Americans have died from the virus, including more than 46,000 Texans. Abbott, however, cited declining numbers of deaths, hospitalizations and
infections in announcing earlier this month he was going to ""open Texas 100%."" No masks required, no restrictions on businesses.
Nguyen said he believes more confrontations are ahead in Texas as shop owners try to protect employees by requiring customers to wear masks without a mask
mandate from Abbott.
""Instead of being a leader, he wants us to deal with it,"" Nguyen said. ""The blood is on his hands if anything happens.""
Neighbors came to Nguyen's aid, helping him clean up the mess. Mayor Ron Nirenberg thanked them, saying the effort ""proved that we're better than this one
hateful act.""
""We must work together to eradicate racism from our city,"" Nirenberg said.
'It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop': President Biden denounces attacks
The Chinese American Citizens Alliance and the Asian American Alliance of San Antonio released a joint statement denouncing the ""ugly display of hate.""
""This ignorant act had not only damaged a business, but it also dishonored the distinguished reputation of San Antonio,"" the groups said.
Incidents of hate against Asian Americans have risen sharply during the pandemic, sparking outrage and activism in the Asian American community and spurring
some lawmakers and organizers to respond to the threat.
""Racially motivated violence and other incidents against Asian Americans have reached an alarming level across the United States since the outbreak of COVID-19,""
a United Nations report released last year found. It cited increases in vandalism, physical assaults and robberies against people, businesses and community centers.
Last week, President Joe Biden condemned the violence Asian Americans have endured throughout the pandemic, saying ""it's wrong, it's un-American and it must
stop.""
Nguyen said he is encouraged by the support he received. He had to open late Sunday due to the cleanup, but said he was overwhelmed with customers. When he
sold out, some just left a donation.
""The day started with negativity but ended positive,"" he said. ""People here, we are not going to tolerate racism and hate.""

The three shootings Tuesday that killed eight people, six of them Asian women, has dramatically increased the sense of
fear in the Asian community, which has already been experiencing an increase in violence and hate incidents.
Police arrested a suspect in the shootings at three spas in Atlanta and a northern suburb Tuesday night. Atlanta police
said Wednesday that it was too early to determine the motive; Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said the
suspect told authorities he had a sex addiction.
Even if the incident is not determined to be racially motivated, community leaders and experts say a series of violent
attacks this year and a rise in hate incidents are fueled by racist rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic and are
""distinct but related trends.""
""Asian American communities were already set on edge. We were alarmed by the rate of violence and hate directed
towards us,"" said Russell Jeung, who created Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks incidents against Asian American Pacific
Islander communities. ""The shooting is again the worst type of violence we could go through. ... It can't continue.""
More: Will Atlanta shootings spur action on anti-Asian hate crime laws?
Spa shootings: Suspect arrested after 8 people killed; most victims were Asian

shooting speaks to a larger problem of violence in America.
“The investigation is ongoing, we don’t yet know, we’re not yet clear about the motive,"" she said. ""But I do want to say
to our Asian American community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and
outraged all people.”
U.S. Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., offered his condolences to the victim's family's on Twitter, highlighting that the shootings
occurred during a spike in anti-Asian violence. Lieu said racist phrases used byformer President Donald Trump

""inflamed discrimination against the Asian American community.""
""Was this a hate crime? We need more evidence,"" Lieu said on Twitter. ""But we do know the alleged murderer targeted
three locations where the victims would disproportionately be Asian women.""
Leaders of Asian American Advancing Justice-Atlanta called on local and state government officials to provide crisis
intervention resources and ""address the root causes of violence and hate.""
“That the Asian women murdered yesterday were working highly vulnerable and low-wage jobs during an ongoing
pandemic speaks directly to the compounding impacts of misogyny, structural violence and white supremacy,” said Phi
Nguyen, the group's litigation director, in a statement.
Anti-Asian violence, hate incidents on the rise
Violence against Asian Americans sharply increased in March 2020 as COVID-19 began spreading across the country,
Jeung told USA TODAY last month.
Stop AAPI Hate, which includes a self-reporting tool for harassment, discrimination and violent attacks, recorded 3,795
incidents of anti-Asian discrimination across the U.S. from its inception on March 19 to Feb. 28, 2021, according to data
released Tuesday before the Georgia shootings.
Women report hate incidents 2.3 times more than men, and Koreans are the second-largest ethnic group that reports
experiencing hate, according to the new data. The South Korean Foreign Ministry said Wednesday that its diplomats in
Atlanta confirmed four of the women killed Tuesday were of Korean descent.
""There is what we call intersectional oppression, that they're seen as vulnerable both because they’re Asian and
because they’re women,"" Jeung said.
Hate crimes against Asian Americans are on the rise: Here's what activists, lawmakers and police are doing to stop the
violence
Another organization, Asian Americans Advancing Justice-Asian American Justice Center, recorded more than 3,000
hate incidents in its self-reporting system since late April 2020 – by far the highest number in the tool's four-year
history.
The FBI collects national hate crime data, but data for 2020 and 2021 has not yet been released. In 2019, 216 anti-
Asian hate crimes were reported, according to the latest data available.
That number may be just a fraction of the true total given that fewer than half of the victims of a hate crime ever
report it to the police, according to data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics.
In Georgia, 32 anti-Asian hate incidents were reported between March 20 and Oct. 28, 2020, mirroring the nationwide
trend, according to Stop AAPI Hate.
Georgia was one of only a handful of states without hate crimes laws until Gov. Brian Kemp signed legislation in June
imposing additional penalties for crimes motivated by bias and requiring data collection on hate crime incidents in the
state. Kemp signed the legislation weeks after Black jogger Ahmaud Arbery was shot by armed white men in what
many called a modern-day lynching.
Recent violent attacks draw outrage
A series of violent crimes against Asians and Asian Americans this year caused concern on social media and prompted
activists and experts to call for more to be done to address violence against the community
In San Jose on Feb. 3, a 64-year-old Vietnamese woman was assaulted and robbed of $1,000 in cash she had
withdrawn for Lunar New Year. No arrest has been made, and there is no indication the robbery was race-related, public
information officer Sgt. Christian Camarillo said.

In New York that same day, 61-year-old Noel Quintana, who is of reportedly Filipino descent, was slashed in the face
with a box cutter on the subway. Quintana told The Washington Post a suspect has been arrested and charged with
assault. Spokesperson Detective Denise Moroney told USA TODAY the NYPD’s Hate Crime Task Force is investigating
the incident as a possible bias crime.
In San Francisco on Jan. 28, Vicha Ratanapakdee, a Thai man, was attacked and later died. Eric Lawson, his son-in-
law, told USA TODAY last month that he believes the 84-year-old was targeted because he was Asian. Lawson added
that his wife, who is Thai, was verbally assaulted twice and told to ""go back to China"" before the attack.
""Everyone is dancing around the issue, and no one's addressing it,"" he said.
'Stop killing us': Attacks on Asian Americans highlight rise in hate incidents amid COVID-19
San Francisco District Attorney Chesa Boudin filed murder and elder abuse charges against Antoine Watson, but his
office has ""no evidence of what motivated this senseless attack,"" spokesperson Rachel Marshall told USA TODAY in
February.
Although it's unclear whether these particular cases are racially motivated, they are certainly ""related"" and ""horrific,""
Jeung told USA TODAY last month.
""What makes it worse is we see our elderly and youth also targeted,"" he said. ""It seems like people are attacking
vulnerable populations.""

against Asian Americans who've been attacked, harassed, blamed and scapegoated.""
""At this very moment, so many of them, our fellow Americans, are on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save
lives,"" Biden said. ""And still, still they are forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down streets in America.
It's wrong, it's un-American and it must stop.""
Biden signed a memorandum in late January denouncing xenophobia and violence against Asian Americans and
Pacific Islanders. Lawmakers from the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, a group of lawmakers
representing the interests of Asian Americans, have requested a meeting with the administration to discuss the
orders' implementation, though the meeting has not yet been scheduled.

202010,"
ATLANTA – Authorities on Wednesday said a gunman suspected of killing eight people, six of whom were Asian women, at three spas may
have frequented the businesses but that it was too early to determine if the shootings would be considered a hate crime.
At least four of the victims of the Atlanta-area spas shootings were women of Korean descent, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said
Wednesday. Two others were of Asian descent, police said.
Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it was too soon in the investigation to say whether the shootings were a hate crime. ""We are just not
there as of yet,"" Bryant said in a news conference early Wednesday.
The suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long of Woodstock, Georgia, was charged with eight counts of murder Wednesday in all three
shootings. Four of the counts against Long are related to shootings at two spas in Atlanta. The other four are related to shootings at a spa in
Cherokee County.
Long has not been charged with a hate crime, a specific charge that authorities must prove a crime was committed on the basis of race,
color, religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation. He purchased a firearm Tuesday – the day of the attacks – from Big Woods Goods, a
sporting good story in Cherokee County. Matt Kilgo, the shop's attorney, said his clients are ""fully cooperating"" with police. ""Everything they
have will be turned over,"" Kilgo said.
Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday that Long told authorities that his actions were not racially motivated and that he
had a sex addiction.
""These locations, he sees them as an outlet for him, something that he shouldn't be doing,"" Cherokee County sheriff’s Capt. Jay Baker said.
""He was attempting to take out that temptation.""
All three spas are listed on Rubmaps.ch, an erotic review site that allows users to search for and review illicit massage parlors. The site is the
most popular of its kind, where buyers who call themselves “hobbyists” or “mongers” looking for sex go to find and share information,
according to a study by Polaris, a nonprofit group that operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline.

latest posted in February.

when the then-19-year-old ran off with his girlfriend. ""Their son sent them a text stating he was not returning home and wanted a fresh
start,"" the report says.
Authorities note in the 2019 report that his parents said Long was ""not suicidal, did not take any medication, and had no mental illnesses.""
Long never really made an impression in school, a former classmate said.
""He was always very reserved and quiet for the most part,"" said Emily Voigt, who attended elementary, middle and high school with Long.
""Never really stood out and a lot of us (who went to school with him) never really got the chance to know him deeper because he was very
shy.""
Long and his father attended church most Sundays, services during the week and went on mission trips at Crabapple First Baptist Church in
Alpharetta, about 30 miles north of Atlanta, Brett Cottrell, a former youth minister told the Washington Post.
Elders at the church said in a statement that they were “grieved” to learn about the shooting Tuesday and are “heartbroken for all involved.”
Baker said Long indicated he intended to travel to Florida to carry out similar acts at ""some type of porn industry"" there. A 9mm firearm was
recovered from the suspect's car when he was arrested, Baker said.
There's been a rise in anti-Asian attacks. Here's how to be an ally to the community.
A visual timeline: What happened at Atlanta spa shootings
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said the spas in Atlanta were not on police's radar.
She acknowledged that the shootings are the latest incident in a string of violence nationwide against Asian Americans amid the COVID-19
pandemic.
""This is an issue that is happening across the country. It is unacceptable. It is hateful. It has to stop,"" Lance Bottoms said.
In Cherokee County, the victims were identified as Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49,
of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44.
Four others were killed at the two Atlanta spas, but police have not yet identified them.
Michels' younger brother, John Michels, 52, said he believes his brother was ""just in the wrong place at the wrong time."" He said they grew
up with a total of nine siblings in Detroit, riding dirt bikes and spending summer weekends at a lake and getting into mischief together. They
both served in the U.S. Army at the same time and his brother served as an infantryman in the late 1980s.
""I'm the closest in age, so we were basically like twins,"" John said. ""We did everything together growing up.""
John said Paul Michels owned an alarm company in Atlanta, where he and his wife, Bonnie, have lived 26 years. ""He was just a very hard-
working Republican,"" John added, ""and a very strong Trump supporter.""
Even in grief, John insisted on putting out a message to the alleged slayer: ""Although this is a tragedy, I forgive that man and so will Jesus
Christ... I cannot hate him for it. I pray for his repentance.""
What we know about the Atlanta shootings: Suspect arrested after 8 people killed at 3 spas parlors
Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks incidents of discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, called the
incident an ""unspeakable tragedy.""
""This latest attack will only exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure,"" the group said.
Vice President Kamala Harris, the first African American and South Asian American woman to be elected vice president, called the incident
""tragic.""
""The investigation is ongoing, we don’t yet know, we’re not yet clear about the motive. But I do want to say to our Asian American
community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people.""
The shootings first unfolded Tuesday evening in Acworth, about 30 miles north of Atlanta. Baker said five people were shot at Young's Asian
Massage Parlor. Two people were found dead on the scene. Three victims were taken to a hospital, where two later died.
About an hour after the shooting in Acworth, Atlanta police responded to a report of a robbery at Gold Spa in northeast Atlanta. Three women
were found dead there, Atlanta Police Sgt. John Chafee said. While police were responding, there was a report of shots fired across the street
at Aromatherapy Spa, where police found one woman dead, Chafee said.

Shortly after the first shooting, Cherokee County sheriff's officials released photos of the suspect, Reynolds said. Long's family immediately
contacted the department and helped authorities in tracking him.
Reynolds said authorities anticipated the suspect's next moves and called sheriff's officials in Crisp County, who worked with Georgia State
Patrol to stop Long. Long is to be arraigned Thursday morning, Reynolds added.
Lance Bottoms praised the swift coordination among law enforcement agencies.
Youngs Asian Massage, the scene of the first attack, is on a strip mall with five other shops, settled between a salon and a boutique. The
strip is on a busy road lined with similar strips malls.
A smoke shop, record store and tool shop sit farther down the strip. There is a vacant shop between Smoke South and RetroSound
Records.
Rita Barron, owner of Gabby’s Boutique, sits next door to the spa and described the owners and employees as hardworking.
Barron was in the shop with her husband and customers the night of the shooting. One of the bullets was shot through the shared wall,
near the baseboard of a wall lined with jackets for sale.
She said her husband noticed the suspect had been sitting in his vehicle outside the spa for about an hour before the attack.
Barron saw workers run out of the store, so she sent her husband to investigate. When he discovered what happened, they called 911.
She said they were not the first to call 911, and police showed up shortly after.
""I feel confused,"" she said, adding she'd never heard gunshots before and wondered what the noises were.
Barron said she knew several of the victims. Aside from the workers, one of those shot was a customer of hers who was in critical
condition, she said. Another is a waitress at a nearby Waffle House. She was killed.
The two spas in Atlanta, Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa, are two of several neighborhood businesses that are frequented during late
nights. Their customers and services remained discreet behind blacked out windows and parking lots behind buildings.
Gold Spa has a blacked-out glass door which prevents visibility from the outside. The windows are concealed by shutters that appear
rusted. At least one set of window covers appear to be held together with duct tape. The only thing visible inside is an LED ATM near the
front entrance.
Mallory Rahman and her 4-year-old daughter, Zara, left flowers on the steps of Gold Spa in Atlanta to pay respects to the young women
who were murdered there the night before.
“I told her that some people were hurt here that should not have been hurt. Some people were hurt by a bad person,” Rahman said. “I
know she’s young, but I also want to teach her from a young age.”
She said her family lives walking distance from the two spas on Piedmont Road, the site of the shootings. While she has not supported the
spas as a customer, she is sickened by the events.
“My mom is in town from out of state and we just cried. It’s just terrible,” Rahman said.
Nearby Aromatherapy Spa, Craig Barnes owns G Salon, a day spa he opened in this Piedmont Heights neighborhood in 1999.
The spas and strip clubs that share the Atlanta thoroughfare with Barnes were here when he arrived more than two decades ago, he said.
The immediate area includes a Mexican restaurant and pizzeria, auto repair shops, medical offices, a psychic and apartment lofts.
“Twenty-one years, no issues,” Barnes said. “I’ve never met anyone, never seen anyone there (at the site of Tuesday’s shooting) in 21
years. They’re quiet. They don’t do business at the same time I do.”
When Barnes shuts his doors to customers at 7 p.m. on weekdays and 6 p.m. on Saturdays, the 24-hour spas are preparing for a rush of
late-night guests.
Shannon Gott, owner of Backwoods Bowstrings, a hunting supply shop north of Atlanta, said Long shopped there about once a year for
arrows, and the store posted a photo of Long this past year on the store's web gallery after he ""harvested an animal"" during deer season.
""Apart from that, I know nothing about this idiot,"" Gott said.
According to Stop AAPI Hate, violence against Asian Americans has sharply increased since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic
began. The group said Asian Americans have been blamed for the pandemic and connected the attacks to racist rhetoric from politicians,
including former President Donald Trump.

202010,"
WASHINGTON – Lawmakers called for action in the aftermath of a shooting in Atlanta that left at least eight
people dead, the majority of whom were Asian American, raising fears among top Asian American lawmakers
about the shooter's motivations amid a nationwide rise in hate incidents.
Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., the chairwoman of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, said the ""crimes
are beyond terrifying, but it just brings home to so many Asian Americans that they are fearful of their lives and
circumstances"" as they faced both the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise in hate incidents.
She said her group of lawmakers met with the Department of Justice to discuss a nationwide rise in hate
incidents and ""we are right now determining actions against AAPI hate."" She called for the passage of legislation
to improve hate crime reporting and also for the establishment of a national day to speak out against anti-Asian
American hate on March 26.
And Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said the killings could spur legislation against hate crimes and for gun
control. He is seeking Republican co-sponsors for legislation to create Justice Department grants aimed at
improving reporting of hate crimes.
“This latest series of murders in Atlanta reflects a rising surge of hate crimes, particularly now directly against
Asian Americans,” Blumenthal said. “Americans should be absolutely revolted and outraged, but more
importantly, do something.”
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement, ""answers are urgently needed to determine whether
this deadly attack was a hate crime, and what can be done to prevent such an act from ever again happening.""
“Our entire nation must come together to speak out to Stop Asian Hate,"" Pelosi said. Chu's caucus would help
lead efforts to ""continue our work to end violence and bigotry in America,"" Pelosi continued.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the first Asian American in the role, told reporters Wednesday that the killing
""speaks to a larger issue, which is the issue of violence in our country and what we must do to never tolerate it
and to always speak out against it.”
Stop AAPI Hate, an advocacy group tracking hate incidents, said it had received nearly 3,800 reports of hate
incidents across the country since March 2020, compared with roughly 100 incidents annually in previous years.
Advocates have sounded the alarm on recent violent attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-
year-old Thai American Vicha Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against senior citizens across the
country.

Congress was set to debate the issue this week. A House panel will hold a hearing Thursday addressing the rise
in anti-Asian American hate and discrimination, its first on the issue since 1987, with testimony from lawmakers
and advocates including Chu. An anti-hate crime bill proposed by Chu and other lawmakers is likely to come up
during the hearing as lawmakers consider their response to the rise in hate.
The shootings could breathe new life into efforts to pass legislation addressing the hate incidents. Asian
American lawmakers introduced legislation addressing the issue in the last Congress, but other than the House's
passage of a nonbinding resolution condemning anti-Asian bigotry and discrimination during the COVID-19
pandemic, no legislation was signed into law.
""We stand in full and complete solidarity with our Asian American brothers and sisters throughout the country,
and we will not rest until we stop Asian hate in America,"" said Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., a member of House
Democratic leadership.
Democrats have blamed much of the increase in hate incidents on former President Donald Trump, citing his use
of derisive terms for the coronavirus. Trump ""clearly stoked the flames of xenophobia against AAPIs with his
rhetoric,"" Chu said, and ignored warnings from advocates and lawmakers and ""doubled down"" on the rhetoric.
The result was the shooting, the latest in a string of racially motivated incidents against Asians nationwide, Chu
said.
""It's clear the individuals were targeted because they are amongst the vulnerable in our country, immigrant
Asian women,"" Chu told reporters.
Local police said Wednesday that it was too soon to tell whether the killings at the massage parlors were racially
motivated, saying they could have been linked to sex addiction.
Yale University Sociology Department chair Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies, said it was hard to
disentangle race from the killings.
The shooter had targeted Asian American women, and given how ""Asian American women have been viewed as
exotic and feminine objects in U.S. mass media and suspected of prostitution from the earliest U.S. immigration
restrictions,"" the suspect could easily have viewed Asian American women in the same manner, she said.
""If you talk to the average Asian American woman, most of us have been subject to varying degrees of sexual
harassment that targets our gender and racial identities,"" Kao said. ""They do not exist separately in the lives of
individuals.""

202010,"
Eight people, mostly women, were killed in three shootings within an hour of one another at spas in Atlanta on
Tuesday night. A 21-year-old suspect is in custody.
Six victims are Asian, four of them of Korean ethnicity, and two are white. The killings followed a recent wave of
attacks against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.
Georgia law enforcement officials say it’s too early in the investigation to determine if the shootings constitute a
hate crime, but they have not ruled it out.
Officials say the suspect, Robert Aaron Long, of Woodstock, Georgia, told them the acts were not racially
motivated. Long told them he has a sexual addiction and frequently visited spas and wanted to eliminate them
as a source of temptation. Authorities say they believe Long acted alone.
FBI Director Christopher Wray told NPR on Thursday that the investigation continues but said, ""at the moment it
does not appear that the motive was racially motivated.""
However, Grace Kao, an expert on Asian American studies and the sociology department chair at Yale University,
told USA TODAY it’s hard to disentangle race from the killings.
Cherokee County authorities charged Long with four counts of murder and one count of assault on Wednesday.
He's expected to face additional charges in Atlanta.
Police arrested Long on his way to Florida, where, he told police, he intended to do “more acts.” He is being held
at the Cherokee County Adult Detention Center. He waived his right to an initial court appearance on Thursday.

The shootings and arrest took place in a three-hour period. Police made the arrest 150 miles from the shooting
sites.
Here is what happened Tuesday:
4:50 p.m.
YOUNG’S ASIAN MASSAGE | Acworth, Georgia
Police find five people shot at the spa. Two are dead inside and two others die later at a hospital. A fifth victim, a
man, remains hospitalized in stable condition.
The spa is in a commercial area about 30 miles north of Atlanta.
5:47 p.m.
GOLD MASSAGE SPA | Atlanta
Atlanta police find three women shot dead inside the spa, located about 27 miles south of the first shooting.
Moments later
AROMATHERAPY SPA | Atlanta
Police at Gold Massage Spa receive reports of shots fired at a third spa across the street. They find one woman
fatally shot.
6-8 p.m.
Police recover video images of a suspect from surveillance cameras of nearby businesses. Police post them on
social media and are contacted by members of the suspect’s family.
The family gives police the suspect’s mobile phone number and police begin tracking his movements. The
highway patrol monitors Interstate 75.
8 p.m.
I-75, about 150 miles south of Atlanta
Georgia State Patrol and deputies from Crisp County are alerted that the suspect is traveling south on I-75 in a
black 2007 Hyundai Tucson.
They use a PIT maneuver – a Precision Immobilization Technique in which an officer bumps the rear of a vehicle
to force it off the road – to stop the suspect.
The suspect is arrested without further incident. A 9mm firearm is found inside the vehicle.
How a PIT maneuver works
One method police officers can use to slow and stop a fleeing vehicle in a high-speed chase is called the PIT
(aka Pursuit Intervention Technique) maneuver. Here's how it works:

202010,"
On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon
everyday scenes of older people’s integration into the fabric of the city and community life.
People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating
meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the
street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of
diabolo.
After three days of walking around Shanghai’s teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing’an Sculpture Park.
An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He’d studied English
in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and
smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.
Asian elders in America are vulnerable
Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older
men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco’s Japantown and a trio of
elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach’s Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of
the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I’ve
not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my hlau modeled
aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.
Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders
that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing

of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days
later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland’s Chinatown. Other violence against
Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and
75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.
Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as
hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren’t a cure-all, and
public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.
COVID: Forget about the frenzy over COVID-19 variants, viral evolution is normal
These attacks haven’t occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity.
Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer
“eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as
vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic’s acute
economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.
Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to
community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, “We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime
rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in
these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and
more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.”
'Bullets flying by your house'
Re-imagining community safety doesn’t mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in
jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and
programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction
efforts targeted towards young people.
In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence
prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming
new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school’s mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer
witnessing this small but important step forward.
“Even if you’re not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,” says Loren Taylor, a city
council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday
afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No
one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings,
I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their
intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.
'China virus' redux: For Trump and Republicans, it's open season on Asian Americans like me
Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID
vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their
activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn’t lose sight of public acts of
interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public
spaces and communities free from racial harm.
When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco’s Japanese Cultural Center in
January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements,
but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for

Celebrities are speaking out about the latest tragedy in the Asian community.
Seven women and one man, most of them of Asian descent, were killed Tuesday night in three Atlanta-area spa
shootings. Two shootings were in northeast Atlanta and the third in Cherokee County. Police arrested 21-year-old Robert
Aaron Long as the suspected gunman. Police said Long told authorities his actions were motivated by a sex addiction,
not race, and he may have frequented some of the spas where the shootings happened.
While police said Long told authorities his actions were motivated by sex addiction, many experts and top Asian
American lawmakers say it's hard not to see racism inextricably tied to the killings due to a recent wave of attacks
against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.
Trevor Noah agrees. The ""Daily Show"" host slammed claims that the shootings weren't racially-charged on his
Wednesday segment.
""Your murders speak louder than your words,"" Noah said.
""Don't tell me that this thing had nothing to do with race, even if the shooter said that. He thinks it had to do with his
sex addiction."" he added. ""This guy blamed a specific race of people for his problems and then murdered them because
of it. If that's not racism then the word has no meaning.""
Trevor also criticized Cherokee County sheriff spokesperson Capt. Jay Baker who said the shooter had a ""bad day"" in a
press conference Wednesday.
""No, yesterday was a 'bad day' for the people who lost their lives. It's always interesting who police try and find the
humanity in,"" Noah said.

What to know about Atlanta shootings: Suspect charged with murder; killings inextricably tied to race, experts say
Olivia Munn, more stars call to #StopAsianHate
Olivia Munn, who recently called out new Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Alexi McCammond for her past racist tweets against
Asians, said she's ""struggling"" with the latest act of violence.
""We are being targeted, we are living in a country that is attacking us simply just for being us,"" Munn said Wednesday
during an interview with Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC's ""Deadline: White House.""
Munn said the Asian-American community needs ""more people to care about us"" and ""amplify"" opposition to such
attacks. She added, ""We need people on social media to denounce this kind of stuff that is happening against us. It’s so
important that we are heard because we have been so invisible for so long.""
She also shared the #StopAsianHate hashtag on Twitter.
Actor Daniel Dae Kim said: ""The race of the person committing the crime matters less than the simple fact that if you
act with hate in your heart, you are part of the problem. And to those with the power to help and yet sit idly by, your
silence is complicity. #StopAsianHate.""
A rise in anti-Asian attacks: Here's how to be an ally to the community
Lana Condor calls for Asian community allies
Some took to social media to spread awareness about the event, with ""To All the Boys I Loved Before"" actress Lana
Condor urging her followers to ""wake up"" and encouraging people to be allies to the Asian community.
""Your Asian friends and family are deeply scared, horrified, sick to their stomachs and wildly angry. Please please please
check in on us, please please please stand with us. Please. Your Asian friend needs you, even if they aren't publicly
grieving on social media.""
Comedian Mindy Kaling urged people to fight against the normalization of anti-Asian rhetoric.
""The targeting of our Asian brothers and sisters is sickening, but not surprising given the normalizing of anti-Asian hate
speech in the past year. We have to #StopAsianHate, enough is enough!""
""Asians are not a monolith,"" Padma Lakshmi tweeted, adding that ""the continent includes around 48 countries and 3
territories, all with unique cultures, food customs and traditions."" But she declared, ""A racist attack against one of us is
an attack against all of us.""
George Takei, Jamie Chung call on leadership for changes
George Takei called the shooting ""a hate crime.""
Takei also urged GOP leaders to ""stop fanning violence with anti-Asian rhetoric."" On March 9, House of Representatives
minority leader Kevin McCarthy shared online COVID-19 resources, but used the term ""Chinese coronavirus.""
""Words have consequences, especially those from our leaders,"" Takei continued. ""Reporters: Ask politicians who trade in
racism if they feel responsible or remorseful for violence committed in the wake of their words.""
Speaking up: Jeannie Mai 'filled with so much anger' over rise of attacks on Asian Americans
Actress Jamie Chung said ""using (Asian Americans) as a scapegoat for a global pandemic"" needs to ""end now.
""These murders and countless acts of violence and the destruction of businesses and white terrorism in our communities
are the direct cause of politicians and leaders fanning the flames of anti Asian rhetoric,"" she wrote on Instagram.
""Historically Asian immigrants have been the scapegoat for others misfortunes.""

She continued: ""It starts by calling it what it is. MEDIA YOU NEED TO DO BETTER, CALL IT WHAT IT IS, DOMESTIC
TERRORISM HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIANS.""
""Crazy Rich Asians"" star Gemma Chan asked her Instagram followers to ""please pay attention to what is happening,
adding ""don’t be silent.""
""We need to stop the (dehumanization) of Asians. We need to stop the scapegoating of Asians for Covid. We need to
unite against all forms of hate,"" she wrote. ""Please spread awareness, check in on your Asian friends because we are
not ok.""
""Shang Chi"" star Simu Liu described ""feeling overwhelming grief at the senseless murder of 8 people in Atlanta.
""Still much we don't know, but it's clear to me that the shooter specifically targeted Asian women. Praying for the
victims' families, and for my Asian sisters. Action to follow,"" he said.
This is America: Stop gaslighting me with the Asian 'model minority' myth
Kahmora Hall, a Season 13 contestant on ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" wrote, ""Every day I worry about if it were my parents,
sisters, cousins & friends in that heartbreaking situation. My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their
families. #STOPAsianHate.""
Celebrities 'stand in solidarity' with the Asian community
Pharrell Williams tweeted a post writing, ""Enough is enough. Last night was another instance of innocent lives being
lost to domestic terrorism. We must protect our Asian brothers and sisters.""
Singer Rihanna posted a tweet calling the Atlanta shooting ""brutal, tragic"" and ""disgusting."" ""AAPI hate has been
rampantly perpetuated & it’s disgusting! I’m heartbroken for the Asian community & my heart is with the loved ones
of those we lost,"" she wrote.
""There is no place for racism, violence, prejudice, or misogyny of any kind, towards any one,"" Jimmy Fallon tweeted.
Camilla Cabello, who had been accused in 2019 of using racial remarks and has since apologized, tweeted: ""We need
to do everything in our power to stand up against hate. Listen to the AAPI community, take their direction, share
resources if you can.""
Kim Kardashian West said ""Asians are human and deserve to be treated as such.""
Her mother, Kris Jenner, added: ""I stand in solidarity with the Asian community, and with any individuals who feel
attacked or marginalized because of the color of their skin. We are one world, one humanity, and one community.""
John Legend said he is ""sending love to all the loved ones of those whose lives were taken.
""Absolutely horrible,"" the ""All of Me"" singer wrote in response to Tuesday night's shooting. ""Our nation needs to
reckon with the increased threats being directed at our Asian-American brothers and sisters.""
""This escalation of attacks on Asian Americans is horrifying. STOP IT. Stop this sickness America. Stop this brutality,""
Patricia Arquette tweeted.
Alyssa Milano showed her support by writing that she stands with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community,
and singer Sara Bareilles described hate toward Asian Americans as ""loud,"" ""exhausting"" and ""destructive.""
""The Asian hate crime tonight in Atlanta-Buckhead and Cherokee County is just so (expletive) appalling and so sad,""
Florence Pugh wrote on her Instagram story.
""Everytime (sic) there's a mass shooting it's so heartbreaking and so destructive and yet America just shakes it's (sic)
head as if that's just part of being in America and carries on. It doesn't have to be. This was targeted. This is white
supremacy. This was targeted Asian murder.""

I genuinely want President Trump to succeed in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus, and will do everything I can to help him in this effort. At stake are the lives of my
elderly parents, my family, my constituents and many Americans. But Trump's repeated insistence on calling coronavirus the ""Chinese virus"" is more than just xenophobic; it
causes harm both to Asian Americans and to the White House's response to this life-threatening pandemic. I served on active duty in the U.S. military to defend the right of any
American to make politically incorrect statements, but as a public figure, I cannot stand idly by while the president uses his pulpit to exacerbate xenophobia in a time of crisis.
Trump claims that in using the phrase ""Chinese virus,"" he's just trying to be ""accurate"" in describing where it's from. But there is a difference between saying the virus is from
China and saying it is a Chinese virus. In a time of unease and uncertainty, such language stokes xenophobic panic and doesn't get us closer to eradicating this virus. Asian
Americans have been assaulted or otherwise discriminated against because of such rhetoric. In New York, a man assaulted an Asian woman wearing a face mask and called her
a ""diseased b---h."" Also in New York, a man on the subway sprayed an Asian passenger with Febreze and verbally abused him. On the subway in Los Angeles, a man ranted at
an Asian American woman, claiming Chinese people are putrid and responsible for all diseases. (The woman happened to be Thai American.)
Trump's rhetoric adds fuel to the growing fire of hatred being misdirected at Asian Americans. The fact that he is the president of the United States, who is responsible for the
well-being of all Americans, only makes his rhetoric even more disturbing. The leaders of both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization
have warned that we should not use terms such as ""Chinese virus."" The novel coronavirus already has an official name, SARS-CoV-2, and an unofficial name, covid-19. Injecting
an ethnic qualifier to the virus is unnecessary and can stigmatize Asian Americans.
Against the backdrop of Trump's unnecessary language lies the history of discrimination against Asian Americans in our country. From the Chinese Exclusion Act to the
internment camps of World War II to the murder of Vincent Chin , Asian Americans are particularly susceptible to being discriminated against by the mistaken belief that we
somehow are foreigners or have foreign ties.
It was myopic thinking to pretend this was a foreign virus that wouldn't become our problem, and it has contributed to our present frantic efforts to play catch-up. On Jan. 22,
Trump was asked on CNBC, ""Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?"" He responded: ""No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in
from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.""
Trump's weak initial response of only barring foreign nationals - either from China or who had visited China - from entering the United States allowed Americans traveling from
China and anyone from Europe to enter the United States with the virus. The president's view that the virus was a Chinese problem contributed to his failure to understand the
importance of testing people domestically for the virus and of having enough medical equipment to deal with the outbreak.
We are still woefully short of test kits across the United States as well as the chemical reagents necessary to process tests. The coronavirus has spread exponentially as a result,
and if that is not mitigated, we will not have enough ventilators for the patients who need them to stay alive. Hospitals and first responders are starting to run out of personal
protective equipment - essential for keeping them healthy and safe.
One country that can help happens to be China. Though the Chinese government certainly made mistakes at the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, we can learn a lot from
Chinese doctors and scientists who were on the front lines of this crisis and also cooperate and get vital medical equipment and supplies. China recently sent doctors,
ventilators, face masks and protective suits to Italy.
For the president to continue using rhetoric that the Chinese find insulting is not helpful. It is not one country's problem to solve. We are in a worldwide, life-threatening
pandemic, and we all need to work together. I wish the president could set aside his xenophobia for the moment while we try to keep Americans from dying.

202108,"
Last week, I was shopping for groceries and preparing to hole up at home with my wife, Evelyn, and our two boys. There was an eerie, peculiar aura in the parking lot in upstate
New York as night fell and shoppers wheeled out essentials and snacks.
Three middle-aged men in hoodies and sweatshirts stood outside the entrance of the grocery store. They huddled together talking. One looked up at me and frowned. There was
something accusatory in his eyes. And then, for the first time in years, I felt it.
I felt self-conscious - even a bit ashamed - of being Asian.
It had been years since I felt that way. I grew up with semi-regular visitations of that sense of racially tinged self- consciousness. It didn't help that I was an awkward kid. But
after adulthood, marriage, a career, parenthood, positions of leadership and even a presidential run, that feeling had disappeared - I thought.
My place in this country felt assured. I have it better than the vast majority of Americans of any background. When comedian Shane Gillis slurred me by name, I did not think
he deserved to lose his job. It barely registered when a teenager yelled ""Chink"" at me from the window of his car in New Hampshire a number of months ago. My only reaction
was to think, ""Well, I'm glad that neither of my sons was around because, then I might have to explain to them what that word means.""
But things have changed.
Over the past few weeks, the number of reported physical and verbal attacks on Asian Americans has increased dramatically. The percentage of Asians who use the not-for-
profit Crisis Text Line to speak with a counselor has shot up from 5 percent of callers - about in line with our share of the population - to 13 percent, an increase of 160 percent.
Some level of background disdain or alienation has grown into outright hostility and even aggression.
And we all know why. The coronavirus is devastating communities and lives. People's livelihoods and families are being destroyed. And people are looking for someone to blame.
Before covid-19, too many Americans were already living paycheck to paycheck, working long hours just to get by. Now, we all are even more fearful for the future, worried
about our parents, grandparents and children. We are anxious about our jobs, bills and next month's rent or mortgage payment.
In early February, when I was still running for president, someone asked me, ""How do we keep the coronavirus from inciting hostility toward Asians in this country?""
I responded, ""The truth is that people are wired to make attributions based on appearance, including race. The best thing that could happen for Asians would be to get this virus
under control so it isn't a problem anymore. Then any racism would likely fade."" This was weeks before ""Chinese virus"" became a thing.
Now it is, and we have to figure out how to combat that, too. I'm an entrepreneur. In general, negative responses don't work. I obviously think that being racist is not a good
thing. But saying ""Don't be racist toward Asians"" won't work.
I have been thinking about ways to improve that encounter at the grocery store. People are hurting. They look up and see someone who is different from them, whom they
wrongly associate with the upheaval of their way of life.
Natalie Chou, a UCLA basketball player, said she felt better when she wore her UCLA gear, in part because the association reminded people that she was an American.
During World War II, Japanese Americans volunteered for military duty at the highest possible levels to demonstrate that they were Americans. Now many in the Asian American
community are stepping up, trying to demonstrate that we can be part of the solution. Some 17 percent of U.S. doctors are Asian and rushing to the front lines.
We Asian Americans need to embrace and show our American-ness in ways we never have before. We need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white
and blue, volunteer, fund aid organizations, and do everything in our power to accelerate the end of this crisis. We should show without a shadow of a doubt that we are
Americans who will do our part for our country in this time of need.
Demonstrate that we are part of the solution. We are not the virus, but we can be part of the cure.

202108,"
In his April 3 op-ed, ""We are not the virus, but we can be part of the solution,"" Andrew Yang failed to recognize the fundamental reality of the racism that drives a teenager to
call him by a slur, or the three men who glared at him with the accusatory look that he is to blame for the novel coronavirus. Those actions against him were not something he
will be able to prove to those people to be wrong; they come from a fundamental dehumanizing perspective held by those people.
Mr. Yang said Japanese Americans proved their loyalty and demonstrated our American-ness by serving in the military. The service of Japanese Americans in World War II was
out of a deep love for our country and its ideals. But the families of those who died in battle were still informed of their loss behind the barbed wire of American concentration
camps.
More insidious was his promotion of the model minority myth. If we can prove our worth to white American society, then we will be accepted - at the expense of other minority
groups ostensibly not as worthy of acceptance. Though Asian Americans are taking the brunt of the discrimination, immigrants have also been scapegoated, and anti-Semitic
conspiracy theories abound about the spread of the coronavirus.
Fear of covid-19 is inflaming fear of those of us who seem different. That doesn't mean we need to change who we are, nor do we need to disprove someone else's prejudices.
We need allies to call out those who exhibit prejudice.
I am a proud American; I don't need to prove it to anyone.
David Inoue, Washington
The writer is executive director for the Japanese American Citizens League.
As a first-generation Chinese American, I am appalled and outraged by Andrew Yang's comments on recent racist attacks against Asian Americans. Mr. Yang bent over backward
to sympathize with and excuse the behavior of people making such attacks and insisted that Asian Americans must disarm such racism by becoming more visibly American: ""We
need to step up, help our neighbors, donate gear, vote, wear red white and blue, volunteer.""
Asian Americans have been doing, and are continuing to do, those things and more, but those acts of being ""more American"" have zero impact on people with bigotry and racial
hatred in their hearts. Does Mr. Yang really believe that the 2-year-old Asian American girl and her 6-year-old sibling who were recently stabbed at a Sam's Club in Texas would
have been spared if only they had been wearing more patriotic clothing?
It is especially telling that Mr. Yang mentions Japanese Americans during World War II, who ""volunteered for military duty at the highest possible levels to demonstrate that they
were Americans."" Yes, they did, and what did it get them? Internment in concentration camps.
Mr. Yang was blaming the victim at a time when Asian Americans are at their most vulnerable position in decades. It is not the job of victims of racism to act in a more pleasing
way. It is the job of everyone to stand up to and fight racial injustice for all races and stop giving excuses for not doing so.
April Lee, Ellicott City
I need a new thesaurus to describe President Trump's continued retaliation against and firing of patriotic Americans. Grotesque, disgusting, repellent, frightening, horrifying -
these words just aren't sufficient anymore.
Call the roll: Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman - who testified truthfully about Mr. Trump's egregious corrupt behavior - and his twin brother, Yevgeny Vindman, who did nothing more
than be his brother's twin. Capt. Brett Crozier of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, who was desperate to save his sailors' lives. Michael Atkinson, inspector general for the
intelligence community, who was the conduit for the whistleblower complaint that led to Mr. Trump's impeachment. Former FBI director James B. Comey; former FBI deputy
director Andrew McCabe; former European Union ambassador Gordon Sondland; former Ukraine ambassador Marie Yovanovitch. Mr. Trump is firing anyone whose actions result
in something negative for him.
Where is the hue and cry from the GOP senators and representatives? Is there not one spine among them?
As I said, I need a new thesaurus.

Fears of the coronavirus have fueled rising anti-Chinese sentiment online as a combination of traditional slurs and new terms such as ""kungflu"" conflate the
pandemic with ethnic and national identity, say social media researchers who tracked surging expressions of hostility for papers published Wednesday.
The researchers fear online hatred and distrust toward China and people of East Asian descent are contributing to an increasingly well-documented rash of
real-world incidents, including verbal attacks, violence and boycotts of Asian-owned businesses.
""The words are like a virus,"" said Joel Finkelstein, director of the Network Contagion Research Institute, a New Jersey-based nonprofit group that tracks hate
speech online. ""That leads to actions that are visible.""
Finkelstein's group, which reports its findings as alerts to government officials, documented a rise of conspiracy theories featuring both anti-Chinese sentiment
and words such as ""bioweapon"" on 4chan's notoriously racist ""Politically Incorrect"" message board and, to a lesser extent, on Twitter, according to one of the
papers.
That paper detailed ""acute increases in both the vitriol and magnitude of ethnic hate"" and said they fueled the spread of misinformation from remote corners
of the Internet into the mainstream. It also noted that an Instagram post last week called for shooting ""every Asian we meet in Chinatown, that's the only way
we can destroy the epidemic of coronavirus in NYC!"" (Instagram removed the post as a violation of its policies.)
A second research group, featuring an international team of scholars from China, Cyprus, Italy, Germany and the United States, published separate research
showing that anti-Chinese slurs on 4chan grew sharply at key moments in the pandemic. It also found less pronounced rises in hostile references to China and
Chinese people on Twitter.
The title of that paper highlighted one of the many anti-Asian comments the team captured from 4chan, "" 'Go eat a bat, Chang!': An Early Look on the
Emergence of Sinophobic Behavior on Web Communities in the Face of COVID-19."" Another 4chan post was even blunter, saying ""THIS IS BIOTERRORISM
NUKE CHINA NOW."" (The paper has not yet been peer-reviewed, a process that typically takes months.)
Both research groups, which include some overlapping members, charted rises in these slurs near the peak of the outbreak in Wuhan, China, where the
pandemic began, and again last month when President Trump used the term ""Chinese Virus"" on Twitter.
The research does not seek to evaluate whether Trump's comments caused the surge of ethnic slurs on 4chan, but ""that was a legitimizing moment,"" said
Jeremy Blackburn, an assistant professor of computer science at Binghamton University who studies online hate. He was a co-author for both papers.
Beyond the Internet, anti-Chinese rhetoric already has had real-life implications in the United States, despite warnings from experts that prolific use of such
language could endanger millions of Asian Americans.
""When it becomes normalized . . . it dehumanizes Chinese and Asians,"" said Russell Jeung, chair of San Francisco State University's Asian American studies
department. ""It's like equating them to a face mask and equating them to the disease, so it's easy to scapegoat and attack them.""
People who look Chinese, particularly those wearing masks, are at increased risk of experiencing the same discrimination faced by people wearing turbans in
the aftermath of the 9/11, attacks, said Jeung, who recently started tracking bias incidents against Asian Americans amid the ongoing pandemic.

202108,"
Fear sent Mei Chau's restaurant spiraling well before New York City halted in-person dining - as much as 20 percent of her business was gone each week
starting in late January, until one day there were just three orders.
It was people's fear of coming to Manhattan's Chinatown, Chau believes, but also Asian families' fears of going out as they watched the coronavirus upend
China's most important holiday. It was fear, she says, of being punched, spat on or glared at because of her race or mask on the subway. It was fear of
bringing covid-19 to the older generation in an immigrant family's cramped apartment.
Each on its own was terrifying. But the combination, the 56-year-old says, ""is just impossible."" Now a banner on Chau's website declares that her decades-
old Malaysian-French restaurant is ready to ""REOPEN!"" - but staff who have to commute from outside the neighborhood won't come back yet to Aux Epices,
Chau says, and she wakes up sweating from nightmares about crowds.
Asian-owned businesses are facing a crippling pileup of pressures during the coronavirus pandemic, advocates and researchers say - pressures that won't all
ease with the country's piecemeal reopening. They've been hurting longer, seeing their group's unemployment rate skyrocket faster, and struggling like many
minority-owned shops to access government aid, often in industries with especially uncertain roads to recovery.
Layered on top as they struggle to reopen: anxiety about attacks and discrimination, as Asian Americans get caught up in a political fight.
For some who think national leaders are encouraging people to link Asians and the coronavirus - blaming China for the pandemic has become a full-fledged
Republican political strategy - the stakes are higher than the fate of family businesses and already-threatened Chinatowns. They're about what kind of
country the United States wants to be.
""Across the nation . . . there is this rise of this blame game,"" said Wellington Chen, who heads Chinatown Partnership, a nonprofit group supporting the
district in New York City. ""This is this legacy moment. . . . What did you guys do? Did you beat up on your neighbors? Is that what you're proud of?""
Economic devastation
In mid-February in Houston, when analysts were still predicting ""very isolated"" damage to the restaurant industry, business owners in that city's Chinatown -
falsely rumored to have a coronavirus outbreak - were talking about hits to businesses worse than after Hurricane Harvey. Even Chinese American medical
practices struggled in New York City, where one doctor attributed 10 to 15 percent drops in traffic to patients' fears of public transportation.
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) went to San Francisco's Chinatown early this year to urge customers back.
The struggles of Asian American businesses have faded from the national spotlight as the pandemic takes hold all over the country, even as these businesses
happen to concentrate in industries facing extended shutdowns, thinner margins and risky futures in the era of social distancing.
As of last month, nearly 10 percent of Asian-owned companies in the United States were restaurants or other food businesses, a share far higher than any
other group, according to an analysis by Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California at Santa Cruz.
Asian business owners are important employers for their communities, experts said, meaning losses radiate outward.

While the coronavirus has hit black and Latino communities especially hard, statistics in New York City also point to a dramatic fallout for Asians, who have
seen the sharpest increase in unemployment nationwide since February.
Less than half of Manhattan Chinatown's restaurants remained open for takeout after mid-March, when the city announced its sweeping shutdown, said
Chen, of Chinatown Partnership. Business advocates in several immigrant communities said it's tough to know yet how many are closed for good, when calls
go unreturned and it can feel rude to even raise the possibility of no return.
""I wish there was more attention from our elected officials,"" said Jennifer Tam, a Chinatown resident who launched a volunteer effort there.
'Their words carry a lot of weight'
With anti-Asian racism flaring during the pandemic, many fear leaders' rhetoric against China could make the return to normal more perilous.
Business after business has forgone even online orders and pickup both ""out of fear of the virus and out of fear of retaliation because of the virus,"" said
Vicente Reid, CEO of Arizona's Asian Chamber of Commerce.
In Georgia, where the push to reopen has been especially aggressive, the couple that owns Chong Qing Hot Pot in Chamblee, Ga., a suburb of Atlanta, has
the same worries as everyone else. What if they get sick? What if a resurgence of the virus shuts them down?
It's the racism piled onto Asian owners' anxieties that makes Gina Rivers cry. She said she thinks President Trump is enabling it.
Trump once made a point of referring to ""the Chinese virus,"" a phrase he has defended as describing the disease's origin, and a strategy memo instructed
Republicans seeking election to the Senate to ""attack China"" rather than speak to the president's handling of the coronavirus. Conservative candidates for
office across the country are taking up similar messages, with one divisive ad in Texas accusing China of having ""poisoned our people"" and leading some to
denounce ""race baiting.""
""I worry for my husband's well-being in this climate,"" said Rivers, who is white. Her husband, Liang Rivers, is from China.
Liang, who has cooked the same Szechuan menu for a decade, says he doesn't pay the president's word choices much mind. He's more worried, he said,
about the people who come in without masks and the fact they're doing half their normal business.
Historian Ellen Wu, who studies the Asian experience in America, worries public information campaigns promoting the Asian community will be undermined
by ""all this messaging right from the top - the really dispiriting messages about the 'China virus.' ""
""The people in power, their words carry a lot of weight,"" said the assistant professor at Indiana University in Bloomington.
Even an offhand comment can unintentionally stoke fears of racism. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sowed panic last week in Vietnamese salon circles
when he said the state's first community transmission of the coronavirus occurred through a nail business.
""We're not Chinese, but we're still Asians, right?"" said Tracy Tran, who used to employ more than 50 people at several salons in Southern California. ""It will
affect us,"" she said.
'Every day is a new day'
In New York City, people in Chinatown are trying to help each other. A volunteer effort of about 20 Asian American professionals has raised more than
$100,000 to buy meals for front-line workers from Chinatown restaurants starved for orders, while the nonprofit Chinatown Partnership worked with local
lawmakers last month to kick off a campaign called Show Some Love in Chinatown. Children are helping parents: One son built Asian-Veggies.com for his
father, who started taking produce orders through WeChat and a glut of text messages.
Some see an opportunity for the Asian diaspora in the United States to marshal strength in a new way. Shirley Tang, who teaches Asian American studies at
the University of Massachusetts at Boston, said collaboration across generations and cultures can help mobilize Asian Americans to produce not only stronger
businesses but stronger communities.
""In order to survive and thrive, they need to know how to not just build their own business but find a way to enliven their whole block,"" Tang said.
Chau's restaurant, Aux Epices, is a testament to the resilience of those immigrant communities on the brink - the culmination of years of passion and
hardship overcome on the way to financial security in America. She's pushed her 10-table business through the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, natural
disasters and a landlord who hiked her rent.
Her restaurant's future, though, has never been more uncertain.
""Every day is a new day,"" she said.
Chau started what would become Aux Epices in 1993 after emigrating from Malaysia and struggling to survive on a waitress's paychecks, begging start-up
money from family and driving a hard bargain on the lease.
The naive plan, she said, was to support her painting career, the ambitions that brought her to New York City in 1986. Then the restaurant took over. She
fiddled with the menu, hung the walls with art and joined a ""sandwich renaissance,"" offering fancy rolls instead of Wonder Bread.
Chau thinks it's ""crazy"" to reopen now even for takeout, with business still dismal and the pandemic raging. But last week, she did it anyway. It felt like the
right thing to do, she said, when governors everywhere were pushing for a restart and when friends who also love Chinatown were trying so hard.
""My heart wanted to come back,"" Chau said.
A table at her entrance blocks people from coming too close in her narrow space, and she wears the face masks her staff had earlier abandoned as they
heard about attacks on Asians with covered faces. She waits for orders, though some days there are zero. Chau says she's given up on a government loan -

Lucy Li tries not to let fear dictate her interactions with patients as she makes the rounds in the covid-19 intensive care unit. But the anesthesiology resident at Massachusetts
General Hospital cannot erase the memory of what happened after work at the start of the pandemic.
A man followed the Chinese American doctor from the Boston hospital, spewing a profanity-laced racist tirade as she walked to the subway. ""Why are you Chinese people killing
everyone?"" Li recalled the man shouting. ""What is wrong with you? Why the f--- are you killing us?""
Stunned at first, then relieved she was not physically attacked, Li is now saddened and angered by the irony that she spends her days and nights helping to save lives. Her work
inserting tubes in patients' airways has grown riskier since the coronavirus emerged - each procedure releasing droplets and secretions that could carry viral particles.
""I'm risking my own personal health, and then to be vilified just because of what I look like,"" said Li, 28, who is wary that one of her patients, too, could harbor such prejudices.
""I try not to think about that possibility when I'm at work taking care of patients. But it's always there, at the very back of my mind.""
Across the country, Asian American health-care workers have reported a rise in incidents of bigotry. The racial hostility has left Asian Americans, who represent 6 percent of the
U.S. population but 18 percent of the country's physicians and 10 percent of its nurse practitioners, in a painful position on the front lines of the response to the coronavirus
pandemic. Some covid-19 patients refuse to be treated by them. And when doctors and nurses leave the hospital, they face increasing harassment in their daily lives, too.
Asian Americans have experienced a sharp increase in racist verbal abuse and physical attacks during the pandemic, with the FBI warning of a potential surge in hate crimes
against Asians as the coronavirus death toll mounts and stay-at-home orders are lifted.
""People are worried about transmission of a disease that they associate with foreignness and Asian faces,"" said Grace Kao, a Yale University sociologist. ""Nothing erases what we
look like.""
There is no comprehensive data measuring anti-Asian bias during the pandemic. An analysis of self-reported incidents by Russell Jeung, chairman of the Asian American studies
department at San Francisco State University, shows a steady rise in reports of harassment and assaults against Asians since mid-March, with twice as many women as men
saying they have been mistreated.
Jeung, who is researching racism and xenophobia amid the coronavirus pandemic, said a multilingual website set up by his department in a partnership with civil rights groups
to document anti-Asian harassment has recorded more than 1,800 incidents since its March 19 launch. Victims said they were spat on, stabbed while shopping, shunned for
wearing masks and barred from entering ride-hailing vehicles.
Some academic experts on race say President Trump's rhetoric regarding the virus and China has contributed to the rise in racial harassment. For weeks, Trump deliberately
referred to the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus"" despite guidance from public health officials to avoid attaching locations or ethnicity to a disease. He has since tweeted that
Asian Americans are not to be blamed for the virus's spread.
""Words matter. People are making that close association between the virus and Chinese people because he insisted on using that term,"" Jeung said.
During a media briefing last week, Trump lashed out at CBS News White House correspondent Weijia Jiang, who is Chinese American, telling her to ""ask China"" after she
questioned him on why he insisted on making testing a global competition at a time when so many lives are being lost. Jiang previously tweeted that a White House official had
called the virus ""the Kung-Flu"" to her face.
White House adviser Peter Navarro, in an ABC News interview Sunday, accused China of sending ""hundreds of thousands of Chinese"" to ""seed"" the coronavirus around the
world. And Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) drew criticism after he blamed the virus's spread on ""thugs in China"" in a high school graduation speech over the weekend.
Jeung said he expects harassment and violence against Asian Americans to grow in coming months as states reopen their economies and people return to work, school and
public life.
""With the China-bashing and with the economy tanking and more deaths from covid-19, we expect anti-Asian bias to only increase,"" Jeung said. ""People make automatic
assumptions, especially in times of threats, and go into fight-or-flight mode. The fight mode is attacking or harassing Asians, and the flight mode is shunning Asians.""

Americans were already struggling with historic levels of mental health problems amid the coronavirus pandemic. Then came the video of George Floyd's death at the hands of
police.
Within a week, anxiety and depression among African Americans shot to higher rates than experienced by any other racial or ethnic group, with 41 percent screening positive
for at least one of those symptoms, data from the Census Bureau shows.
The findings - from a survey launched by the federal government originally intended to study the effects of the novel coronavirus - indicate that the recent unrest,
demonstrations and debate have exacted a disproportionate emotional and mental toll on black and Asian Americans, even as rates of anxiety and depression remain relatively
flat among white Americans and decreased among Latin Americans.
The rate of black Americans showing clinically significant signs of anxiety or depressive disorders jumped from 36 percent to 41 percent in the week after the video of Floyd's
death became public. That represents roughly 1.4 million more people.
Among Asian Americans, those symptoms increased from 28 percent to 34 percent, a change that represents an increase of about 800,000 people.
The data comes from an emergency weekly survey of U.S. households launched by the Census Bureau at the end of April to measure the pandemic's effects on finances,
housing, education and health. In the most recent data release, more than 1 million households were contacted through email and text, and more than 100,000 responded,
creating a robust sample size for the findings. Analysis of the data was conducted by multiple federal agencies including the Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics.
Included in the 20-minute survey - called the Household Pulse Survey - were questions from two screening tools used by doctors to help determine whether patients might have
major depressive disorder or generalized anxiety disorder. The results provide a real-time window into the country's collective mental health.
Data collected in 2019, released two weeks ago by the CDC, allows for the most accurate comparison to date of America's mental health from before the pandemic to after.
And that comparison is stark: Rates of depression and anxiety symptoms have more than tripled since the coronavirus hit.
But the increases have hit black Americans especially hard.
""When we think about the impact of covid-19 among black Americans and other underserved populations - they have had to remain in the workforce or they have felt the effect
of unemployment,"" said Erlanger Turner, a licensed psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Pepperdine University. ""When you add the police killings from the last
couple of weeks, it makes sense that you would see additional stress among the black community.""
The census survey collects data over a six-day period weekly, from Thursday to the following Tuesday. The video of George Floyd's death began circulating widely online May 26,
the last day of data collection for Week 4. The following week, May 28 to June 2, mass protests spread across the country.
In the wake of such incidents - as images keep replaying and debates ignite throughout the country - ""it can feel like it's happening to you over and over,"" said Wizdom Powell,
director of the University of Connecticut's Health Disparities Institute. ""You start seeing symptoms of hyper vigilance, emotional numbing and secondary trauma.""
A 2018 study in the journal Lancet found that following police shootings, African Americans suffer higher levels of psychological distress than white people even when they live
in the same community.
""It's hard for others outside of the community to understand the level to which we feel each others' pain. With the George Floyd killing and other killings, we don't have a
personal connection to those individuals. But it could have been us or someone we know, and that does lead to additional stress and anxiety around these incidents,"" said
Turner, author of ""Mental Health Among African Americans.""
One surprising finding in the new census data was that Asian Americans experienced the largest one-week change in anxiety and depression symptoms of any racial or ethnic
group. Asians had the lowest rates of depression in 2019 - just 3 percent screened positive - but that rate has soared during the pandemic.

had faced racism before, but xenophobia driven by the virus made her fear violence for the first time
When the coronavirus started spreading across the United States, triggering a surge in anti-Asian hate crimes, I
began feeling uncharacteristically anxious. As a Korean American, I was used to microaggressions - being
complimented on my English (though I was born and raised in the States), being asked where I really came
from - but this felt different. For the first time in my life, I feared for my physical safety. I feared becoming a
target of violence because of my race.
Sometimes my eyes would well up with tears as I read reports from across the country of Asians and Asian
Americans being assaulted, spat on, stabbed and even burned with chemicals by people who associated them
with the virus. In early March, only a block away from my Manhattan workplace, a Korean woman was punched
in the face by a stranger who said ""You've got coronavirus"" and cursed at her; the woman was taken to the
hospital with a possible dislocated jaw. As the spring went on, I heard about two Asians being stabbed and
another getting severely beaten in racially motivated incidents in my Queens neighborhood.
The pandemic has made me more aware of racism - how it bubbles beneath the surface of everyday life and can
erupt at any time, even in a cosmopolitan place like New York. It also has given me a new sense of some of the

anxiety that black people face on a regular basis. One mother recently told NPR about how, upon spotting two
white men laughing with one another, her son commented: ""It must be nice to wake up in the morning and feel
safe, to not be afraid to go out and do what you have to do for the day, to hang out with your friends, not be
afraid of the police. I wonder what that is like."" Though in my case I was more afraid of racist civilians than of
law enforcement, such accounts resonated with me more deeply than before.
I felt nervous going to my local pharmacy or grocery store, afraid that some malicious stranger might accost me
on the sidewalk and harass or harm me. Before stepping outside to run an errand, I would always weigh the
potential trade-offs: Do I really need a new jug of milk? Is it worth the risk? When I did venture out, I became
painfully aware of people's wary glances and nasty stares, or how they walked away when they saw me headed
in their direction. After only a few months of this, I felt exhausted. What would it feel like to deal with it for a
lifetime? And what would it feel like to endure not only random, individual confrontations but systemic
discrimination? Anti-black racism influences matters from housing to the air quality in your neighborhood, from
access to health care to whether your doctor treats you well. It shapes how you are viewed in professional
settings and by police, teachers and bankers. Though the glimpse I got into black people's experience of racism
was eye-opening, my understanding of it was still limited.
As protests against racial inequality and police brutality gathered in New York and nationwide, I received text
messages from some of my Asian friends urging me to stay inside, where it's safe. They told me that Asians
should not get involved in these struggles - that these matters didn't concern us. That if violence were to break
out during the protests, we would end up becoming ""collateral damage.""
I understand where they may have been coming from. Asian Americans occupy a murky space in America's
racial hierarchy: We can't claim white privilege, but we're not consistently or definitively considered people of
color, either, and so sometimes we don't know if we even have the right to raise our voices; we don't know what
our role in the conversation should be. Some people in my community believe that it's natural for us to stay
detached and uninvolved. We're used to being invisible, and that invisibility has often felt safe.
But America's racial narrative does involve us. It created the model-minority myth - the notion that Asian
Americans are successful because we're hard-working, obedient and don't complain - which many within our
community bought into over the years. But that myth is not an honest compliment: The U.S. government used
it to discredit the civil rights movement and to win allies in the Cold War. It's also been wielded against us to
keep Asian Americans in line, to prevent us from entering certain professions, and to pit us against black people
and other people of color. Meanwhile, it was largely because of black activists' efforts during the civil rights
movement that the Immigration and Naturalization Act of 1965 was passed, removing immigration quotas based
on national origin and ushering in a wave of Asian immigrants. The Black Power Movement also helped spark
Asian American advocacy - in fact, the term ""Asian American"" was coined in 1968 by University of California at
Berkeley students Emma Gee and Yuji Ichioka, who drew inspiration from the Black Power Movement.
As sociology professor Anthony C. Ocampo recently told Time magazine, by taking a stand against anti-black
racism, Asian Americans send an urgent message: ""The same racist logic schemes that are keeping our
communities down might look different in Black communities than they look in Asian American communities, but
it's still the same system"" - one that puts Asian Americans ""in a position where we can't write our own stories in
this country."" For some Asian Americans, taking a stand has meant attending protests. Others have organized
fundraisers for racial justice organizations and bail funds. And many have grappled with how to educate our
relatives and friends, asking them to think about their own experiences with oppression and to draw connections
to America's past and present.
Perhaps the single biggest realization I've had over the past few months is that our experiences dealing with
racism are not merely individual: They're different manifestations of an overarching injustice. The pandemic has
initiated Asian Americans like me into the experience of feeling personally endangered by racism. But though it'd
be a natural first instinct to retreat, to seek refuge in invisibility and silence, our vulnerability should instead
inspire us to reach out - to others in our community, and to people beyond it - so that we can collectively

After Trump's diagnosis, hostility spread anew on Twitter, analysis finds
News of President Trump's coronavirus diagnosis is fueling renewed attacks against Asian Americans and
hostility toward China across social media, according to researchers with civil rights group the Anti-Defamation
League.
In an analysis of 2.7 million tweets in the three days after Trump announced his and first lady Melania Trump's
diagnosis on Twitter, the ADL found elevated language associated with hostility against Asians, compared with
the previous day. In the 12 hours after Trump's announcement, ADL saw an 85 percent spike in such language.
The announcement sparked thousands of online conversations blaming China for trying to purposefully infect the
president, the researchers found.
For example, in one since-deleted tweet to her 394,000 followers, pro-Trump former congressional candidate
DeAnna Lorraine said that ""China must pay for giving Trump COVID"" and swore that ""we will have justice.""
Another Twitter user with 114,000 followers blamed Chinese President Xi Jinping for trying to assassinate
Trump.

Public Concern About Violence, Firearms, and the Covid-19 Pandemic in California
JAMA Network Open
The pandemic presents an unprecedented danger to human health - and not just because of covid-19. New
research suggests the pandemic has stoked rising worries about violence and fueled gun ownership.
Published in the journal JAMA Network Open, the study relies on data from the 2020 California Safety and Well-
Being Survey, which covers topics related to firearm ownership, practices and exposure to violence. The 2,870
California adults surveyed reported rising concern about violence during the pandemic. About 1 in 10 were
concerned someone they know might harm themselves.
About 7 percent of respondents who reported they had experienced unfair treatment believe it occurred because
of the pandemic.

Recent attacks on
Asian Americans renew worries over lack of data
A spate of high-profile assaults on Asian Americans has renewed long-standing criticism from Democrats and
civil rights groups that the U.S. government is vastly undercounting hate crimes, a problem that they say has
grown more acute amid rising white nationalism and deepening racial strife.
The attacks - including several in Northern California over the past month that attracted national attention -
followed months of warnings from advocates that anti-China rhetoric from former president Donald Trump over
the coronavirus pandemic was contributing to a surge in anti-Asian slurs and violence.
Although President Biden last month signed an executive action banning the federal government from employing
the sort of ""inflammatory and xenophobic"" language Trump used to describe the virus - such as ""China plague""
and ""kung flu"" - Asian American leaders said the recent attacks demonstrate a need for greater urgency in
dealing with such threats.

Among other incidents, Vicha Ratanapakdee, an 84-year-old San Francisco resident who had emigrated from
Thailand, was killed in late January, in a brazen attack captured on a video that went viral on social media.
Antoine Watson, a 19-year-old African American man, was charged in connection with Ratanapakdee's death
and has pleaded not guilty.
Biden administration officials said they are working to address the problem, pointing to a section in the
executive memo that instructed the Justice Department to expand its reporting, tracking and prosecutions of
""hate incidents."" Officials said those efforts could go beyond hate crimes to include episodes of harassment and
discrimination.
During his Senate confirmation hearing Monday, Merrick Garland, Biden's nominee for attorney general, pledged
to support such efforts.
""Hate crimes tear at the fabric of our society. They make our citizens worried about walking the streets and
exercising even the most normal rights,"" Garland said. ""The role of the [Justice Department's] Civil Rights
Division is to prosecute those cases vigorously, and I can ensure you that it will if I am confirmed.""
A 1990 federal law mandates that the FBI collect data specifically on hate crimes each year, but the effort has
long been plagued by incomplete and inconsistent data provided by the nation's estimated 18,000 state,
municipal and tribal law enforcement agencies.
The administration is in the early stages of identifying strategies to compel broader participation. Among the
ideas advocates have pushed for is tying federal funding from the Justice Department's extensive grant
programs to increased training and reporting on hate crimes.
In 2019, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued a report recommending Congress adopt legislation to
provide funding for incentives and calling on local police to establish dedicated hate-crime units. Catherine E.
Lhamon, who chaired that commission, now serves as deputy director for racial justice and equity on the White
House domestic policy council.
At a news conference last week, Rep. Judy Chu (D-Calif.), chair of the Asian Pacific American Caucus, said she is
requesting a meeting with Justice Department leaders to discuss what she called a ""crisis point"" for the Asian
American community in dealing with ""an alarming surge of anti-Asian bigotry across the nation.""
Chu added that the 1990 law on reporting of hate crime data ""doesn't have any teeth"" because it does not
compel localities to comply or to do so in a consistent and thorough manner.
Last fall, the FBI reported 7,314 hate crimes nationwide in 2019, the most in a decade - but experts said the
statistics were woefully inadequate because too few local law enforcement agencies fully participate in federal
data collection efforts.
The FBI said that 15,588 law enforcement organizations participated in the 2019 hate crimes study, but just
2,172 agencies reported the total number of incidents contained in the report. Civil rights advocates called that
scenario implausible, pointing out that the entire state of Alabama reported no hate crimes to the FBI in both
2018 and 2019.
""The FBI reports help us identify trends, but their data is so woefully inadequate that it can't be relied on for
much,"" said civil rights lawyer Arjun Singh Sethi, author of ""American Hate: Survivors Speak Out.""
Some big-city law enforcement agencies have publicly reported an increase in bias attacks against Asian
Americans. For example, New York City's hate crimes task force investigated 27 incidents in 2020, including 24
tied to the coronavirus, a ninefold increase from the previous year.
But experts said local police agencies lack training and funding to properly investigate hate crimes, and many

treat it as a low priority. Some conservative Republicans have opposed more stringent reporting requirements
to determine whether crimes are motivated by hate, arguing that such measures are redundant.
Yet advocates have pointed to a 2013 study from the Justice Department's Bureau of Justice Statistics that
found an average of 259,700 violent and property-related hate crimes from 2003 through 2011 after
assessing data from the annual National Crime Victimization Survey of American households.
In a statement, the FBI said participation in its data program is ""voluntary."" The agency added that it
anticipates the reporting methods would improve in the coming years as a greater percentage of local police
agencies transitions into the National Incident Based Reporting System, which requires more detailed and
consistent data.
In a bipartisan vote last year, the House approved the Jabara-Heyer No Hate Act, which aimed to bolster
federal aid to localities for hate-crime training and reporting. The GOP-controlled Senate refused to vote on it.
The legislation is named after Khalid Jabara, a man of Lebanese descent shot to death by a White neighbor in
Oklahoma in 2016, and Heather Heyer, a counterprotester killed at a white-supremacist rally in Charlottesville
in 2017. Neither of their killings was included in the FBI's hate crime reports.
With Democrats in control of both chambers, Chu said she hoped to revive the legislative effort. Rep. Ted Lieu
(D-Calif.) said he expects to gain bipartisan support for a letter to the Justice Department's new leadership
team similar to the one he sent last year with 150 co-signers from both parties asking then-Attorney General
William P. Barr to ""forcefully condemn anti-Asian bias."" Barr did not respond to that letter, Lieu's office said.
Advocacy groups have sought to fill the breach through websites and hotlines that allow Asian Americans to
self-report hate incidents, projects that share similarities to efforts from Muslim American groups to
document bias crimes after the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001.
Stop AAPI Hate, a West Coast-based collective founded last spring in response to the pandemic, reported
2,808 ""hate incidents"" nationwide aimed at Asian Americans from March through December 2020. For months
leading to the November election, Trump sought to deflect blame over his management of the pandemic
response by blaming China and using xenophobic and racist language to describe the virus on social media, in
televised interviews and at campaign rallies and White House coronavirus task force briefings.
The group said verbal harassment made up 71 percent of the incidents, while physical assaults made up
about 9 percent. Organizers said the effort has helped raise media awareness and drawn celebrities to amplify
the message, but some experts cautioned that the data is largely unvetted.
""It's incredibly important for organizations to provide those kinds of narratives about the impact of hate, but
at the end of the day it's anecdotal and cannot displace the onus on our government to provide accurate
data,"" said Maya Berry, executive director of the Arab American Institute, which helped draft early versions of
the No Hate legislation.
John C. Yang, executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice-AAJC, which has collected self-reported
incidents of anti-Asian bias since 2017, said his group also has tallied a spike in the past year. But he
acknowledged that it is difficult for advocacy organizations to adequately analyze such information.
""Some recent incidents, whether they are anti-Asian or something else, is hard to tell,"" Yang said. ""As the
pandemic has worn on, the economic disparity has really played out and the physical and mental anxieties
are playing out as well, and it's probably all contributing.""

They gather almost every night at San Francisco's Dragon Gate, the ornately decorated entrance to the nation's
oldest Chinatown. Armed with only whistles and pamphlets, the volunteer neighborhood patrol roams the
streets, checking out ATMs and mom-and-pop shops in areas where Asian residents have experienced attacks
that have left this neighborhood on edge.
Some volunteers drive more than an hour to walk these blocks - largely deserted by a combination of fear and
pandemic lockdown - to hand out bilingual fliers that explain how to report a crime to police. Similar patrols
have sprouted in Asian neighborhoods in Oakland, Calif., Los Angeles and New York City, a response to what
these communities say is a wave of racist violence and harassment since headlines about a virus from China
began appearing in U.S. media a year ago.
Data is scant, but at least two U.S. cities logged an increase in hate crimes against Asian Americans in 2020.
The New York Police Department reported at least 28 hate crimes that targeted Asian American victims last year,
compared with three the previous year. San Francisco's preliminary data shows that nine hate crimes targeted
Asian Americans in 2020, up from six the year before and four in 2018.

Several viral videos of attacks on Asian pedestrians this month have heightened concerns: a Filipino man
slashed with a box cutter on a New York City train; a 52-year-old woman shoved to the ground in Flushing,
Queens; a woman punched in the face on a New York subway platform; and a Los Angeles man beaten with his
own cane at a bus stop.
It's unclear whether the violence in each of those viral videos was racially motivated, but the incidents have left
Asian Americans feeling not only under attack but also largely alone in addressing neighborhood crime, with
many of the assailants remaining elusive. While some residents have joined neighborhood patrols, others are
arming themselves for protection. And still others have pushed for law enforcement to create task forces and
liaisons to better address neighborhood concerns.
""People are fed up about not being heard, not being seen and waiting for help,"" said Will Lex Ham, an activist
who has participated in the San Francisco Chinatown street patrols and organized rallies in New York. ""We're not
getting the allyship we need, the resources we need. We have to pick ourselves up by the bootstraps.""
Public attention to attacks on Asian Americans soared after 84-year-old Vicha Ratanapakdee was assaulted in
San Francisco last month. According to his son-in-law Eric Lawson, he was on his daily neighborhood walk and
recovering from multiple heart surgeries when he was shoved so violently that he later died.
""Thai grandpa,"" as he was known by community activists, became a rallying cry for celebrities and other Asian
Americans who added his face to their social media profile pictures. His daughter Amy Ratanapakdee believes it
was a hate crime.
""It's like a senseless act of violence and could happen to any one of us,"" she said, adding that her own children
have been called racial epithets on the street during the past year. ""I want everyone to know how my father
died and hope that in his memory, people will join me to hope that justice presides.""
A 19-year-old man has pleaded not guilty to murder in Ratanapakdee's attack. And a suspect has been arrested
in the case of Noel Quintana, the 61-year-old Filipino man whose face was slashed on a New York City subway
train as he traveled to work earlier this month.
""Nobody came, nobody helped, nobody made a video,"" he said.
Quintana reported the crime to police, and the suspect has been charged with assault. But many cases never
get that far.
Victims from marginalized communities can be reluctant to engage with police because of cultural differences,
language barriers or distrust. Even when they do report, proving that they were targeted because of their race is
difficult.
To fill in the data gap, some Asian American organizations are tracking these incidents on their own. Stop AAPI
Hate was launched last March to collect information on suspected cases of racially motivated violence and
harassment. (AAPI stands for Asian American Pacific Islander.) It received more than 2,808 self-reported
incidents from across the country by year's end.
Of those incidents, 9 percent were physical assaults and 71 percent were verbal attacks. Among the victims,
most were women, and about 126 reported being older than 60.
""We were flooded immediately with hundreds of incidents,"" said Russell Jeung, a professor of Asian American
studies at San Francisco State University, who helped launch the site. ""We have large numbers of elderly
reporting that you wouldn't think would complain, but they knew racism when they experienced it.""
Of the self-reported victims, 41 percent were Chinese, 15 percent were Korean, 8 percent were Vietnamese and
7 percent were Filipino. States with higher Asian populations report more incidents, with California most

represented followed by New York at about 13 percent.
But some Asian communities suspect that the rash of attacks is even worse than the data suggests. The
tendency to underreport is why Iona Cheng thinks her community in Oakland has become a target.
""They're attacking Asian women, often for cultural reasons. They don't speak out. They don't press charges.
They don't speak English well in some cases,"" said Cheng, who is Chinese American.
The 48-year-old cancer epidemiologist had just delivered a Christmas gift in late December when a group of
preteens tackled her to the ground, punched and robbed her. Police believe the same group stomped on an
Asian woman in her 60s later that night, breaking her kneecap.
""I can't walk outside the door of my house and feel safe,"" said Cheng, who added that someone called her
""coronavirus"" while she was jogging last March in Oakland. ""I just feel like that was taken from me.""
Gun ownership has become a solution for some. David Liu, owner of Arcadia Firearm and Safety in the
predominantly Asian city of Arcadia, Calif., said his 2020 sales soared four times higher than in a typical year.
Liu said he saw an uptick in Asian Americans interested in purchasing firearms, but interest has been
skyrocketing among ""basically everybody.""
National gun sales are not tracked by race or ethnicity, but in a survey by the National Shooting Sports
Foundation last year, gun retailers estimated a nearly 43 percent average increase in sales to Asian customers
in the first half of 2020 - the smallest jump among the four reported racial or ethnic groups. By comparison,
the survey estimated an average sales increase of 52 percent to White customers and 58 percent to Black
customers.
San Francisco social worker Jason Gee decided to buy a handgun in the spring after a series of incidents that
included an assault, a home invasion and the breaking of his car windows. And on his way to buy the gun, in
the parking lot, four White men called him and his friend ""the coronavirus"" and ""chinks.""
While in line to buy the firearm, Gee said, he noticed that most of the customers were also Asian.
But he soon started to worry that his purchase was ""playing to fear"" and ultimately making his community
less safe, and decided to sell the firearm back.
""If you show up here . . . expecting violence, that may put you in a certain mind frame where you may
misread a situation and respond to it with violence.""
Local leaders have made similar pleas, including Oakland Police Chief LeRonne Armstrong, who expressed
concern about civilian gun owners creating ""unintended victims.""
He held a news conference on Feb. 16 after a Chinatown shopkeeper was jailed for allegedly firing his weapon
at a man he believed was robbing a woman on the street. ""We don't want people to fire weapons into our
community,"" he said. ""While we appreciated people's interest in keeping our community safe, we want them
to observe and report.""
That sentiment makes San Francisco gun owner Chris Cheng furious. Cheng, who describes himself as a
Second Amendment advocate, has owned a gun since 2008 and said friends and strangers have been
reaching out to him about gun ownership in response to the attacks.
""I think a lot of Asian Americans are realizing that the police can only do so much and that the police are not
always there to protect us,"" Cheng said. ""They're only there to take the report.""
Some law enforcement agencies have been trying to do more. Police departments in San Francisco and New

York City have set up task forces to focus on the issue and increased police presence in predominantly
Asian neighborhoods.
The 25 detectives on the NYPD's all-Asian task force speak 11 languages among them. In July, when an
89-year-old woman whose face had been slapped and shirt set on fire didn't initially cooperate with the
investigation, Deputy Inspector Stewart Loo, commanding officer of the task force, sent a detective who
speaks Cantonese to talk to her.
""She saw him, and it was like seeing her grandkids or something like that. She opened up,"" Loo said. ""The
details [she gave] were very precise, very clear. And from that interview, she was able to ID the people
that tried lighting her on fire, which led to an arrest.""
At least 18 people have been arrested in suspected hate crimes against Asian Americans in New York since
the attacks began in 2020, Loo said.
Many have placed blame for anti-Asian violence on former president Donald Trump, who repeatedly called
the coronavirus the ""China virus"" and ""kung flu"" during his time in office. The Anti-Defamation League
found that anti-Asian sentiment on Twitter spiked after Trump's October covid-19 diagnosis. Even before
that, about a third of Americans in a survey released in April reported witnessing someone blame Asian
people for the pandemic.
But Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) says the problem runs deeper than the former president. During House
Democrats' roundtable discussion Friday about the attacks, Takano noted that ""this sort of bias is latent
throughout American society, and it gets worse or less worse depending on the moment.""
As far back as the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned Chinese laborers from immigrating to the
United States, insidious ideas about Asian people's influence have fueled racist sentiments in the country.
The act was a product of the ""yellow peril,"" a paranoia that Chinese immigrants were a threat to White
Americans' jobs and other aspects of Western life.
These ideas carried into the 20th century, when Chinese American Vincent Chin was fatally beaten in
Detroit in 1982 after two men allegedly mistook him for Japanese, a group that was being blamed for the
decline of U.S. automakers. Chin's assailants received a fine and probation for his death.
Tensions between Asian and Black communities also date back decades and have been reignited by videos
that show Black perpetrators in many of the recent attacks on Asian Americans. Those tensions are rooted
in the proximity in which the two under-resourced communities often live and work, while ""fighting for
crumbs,"" said John C. Yang, president and executive director of Asian Americans Advancing Justice in
Washington.
That mutual suspicion has boiled over several times in recent history. In 1991, a Korean American
convenience store owner in Los Angeles accused 15-year-old Latasha Harlins of shoplifting before fatally
shooting her. The shopkeeper was convicted of voluntary manslaughter but served no jail time. A year
later, the acquittal of the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney King set off riots in the city, during
which many Korean shops were burned and looted.
""There was a sense that the shopkeepers were not respectful of the Black clientele, didn't trust the Black
clientele, and also overcharged the Black clientele,"" said Brenda Stevenson, a history professor at UCLA
and author of ""The Contested Murder of Latasha Harlins: Justice, Gender and the Origins of the L.A. Riots.""
""On the other side, the Korean American shopkeepers at the time felt that the clientele were dangerous
and untrustworthy. Some of them had been assaulted, some had been killed.""

Families fear infection in multigenerational homes, harassment at school
It's happening in well-to-do Pakistani households in the suburbs of Washington and among Chinese restaurant
workers in Philadelphia. It's happening among weary Filipino nurses in Queens, Hmong refugee families in
Minneapolis and in Silicon Valley's Asian American community.
As school buildings start to reopen, Asian and Asian American families are choosing to keep their children
learning from home at disproportionately high rates. They say they are worried about elderly parents in
cramped, multigenerational households, distrustful of promised safety measures and afraid their children will
face racist harassment at school. On the flip side, some are pleased with online learning and see no reason to
risk the health of their family.
In New York City, Asian American children make up the smallest share of children back in classrooms - just
under 12 percent - even though they represent 18 percent of all students. In Tennessee, less than half of Asian
families enrolled in Metro Nashville Public Schools opted for in-person learning, compared with nearly two-thirds
of White children.

In Chicago, two-thirds of White students chose in-person learning, while just a third of Asian, Black and Latino
students decided to head back. And in Fairfax County Public Schools, the largest district in Virginia, just over 30
percent of Asian families selected face-to-face instruction this spring, by far the smallest return rate reported
among any racial group.
The academic consequences could be devastating, warned Mya Baker of education nonprofit TNTP, which works
with school districts across the country to boost achievement among low-income and minority students. This is
especially true in communities of immigrant and refugee Asian families, she said, who are often overlooked due
to the pervasiveness of the ""model minority myth.""
In reality, many Asian communities face the same kinds of challenges that hold back Black and Latino students,
including poverty, language barriers and under-resourced schools. In New York City, more than 1 in 5 Asians live
in poverty, the second highest of any racial or ethnic group, according to city data.
According to the Pew Research Center, nearly 30 percent of Asians in the United States live in intergenerational
households, almost double the percentage of White households. And Asian Americans represent the most
economically divided racial group in the nation, with the success of the affluent obscuring the plight of the least
fortunate.
""Everyone makes assumptions that, 'Oh, Asian kids are doing better with virtual learning,' "" Baker said. ""The
reality is we're talking about families living in multigenerational households, families where English is not spoken
at home, so we're increasing barriers for those students who are already not performing well.""
Baker said that is why it is essential for schools to work doubly hard to reach Asian families - about a third of
Asians in the United States have limited English proficiency - and to reassure them that their children will not be
targeted.
In Virginia and Maryland, Asian American students seem to be suffering smaller academic losses than their
Black and Latino classmates. But in other places, like Minneapolis, where the Southeast Asian refugee
community faces steep rates of poverty, students appear to be losing ground as fast or even faster than other
students of color. In fall 2019, about 7 percent of grades given to Asian students were F's. That percentage
more than quadrupled - to 30 percent - in the fall of 2020, according to the Sahan Journal, which reports on
Minneasota's immigrant communities.
Anxiety about being targeted
Many Asian Americans have been anxious of being targeted after President Donald Trump used racist language
to describe the coronavirus. Critics warned his repeated use of phrases like ""Chinese virus"" and ""kung flu"" could
escalate attacks on Asian Americans, who reported rising instances of harassment. Now, a spate of high-profile
attacks on Asian Americans has many in the community on edge.
In New York City, a Filipino man was slashed with a box cutter on the subway, an Asian woman was punched in
the face on a subway platform, and another woman was shoved to the ground in Flushing, a predominantly
Asian community in Queens. In Los Angeles, a man at a bus stop was beaten with his own cane, and a Thai
grandfather died after being pushed to the ground in San Francisco. It's unclear whether race motivated all the
crimes, but the incidents, combined with increasing reports of harassment and bullying, have heightened
anxiety in many communities.
The ripple effects among families weighing whether to send their children back are far-reaching.
In New York City, Liz OuYang, a Columbia University adjunct professor and civil rights attorney who specializes
in combating hate crimes, said some Asian American families are fearful about setting foot outside their homes.

American Advocates, said parents and kids have shared stories of strangers harassing them, yelling at them
to ""speak English"" or ""go back to your home country.""
It has made some families fearful of sending their children on solo commutes to school. So instead, they keep
them home, learning remotely.
In New York City's Chinatown, a school principal said one mother moved her child from in-person learning to
remote learning after she and her child were harassed on the subway. Some families are so worried about
leaving their apartments that the school has shelled out funds to ship or hand-deliver supplies and packets to
them.
Parents have relayed the same fears in Philadelphia. Anna Perng, co-founder of the Chinatown Disability
Advocacy Project, said parents reported their children were being harassed on city buses. Then, over the
summer, police arrested a homeless woman for attacking a pregnant woman in Chinatown, calling her a slur
and punching her in the face.
That sent the anxiety in Philadelphia's Asian American communities into overdrive, Perng said, and now
threatens to deprive them of access to school-provided resources they badly need.
""Families have told me they're afraid to go to the school district to get things like worksheets, learning
supplies and the free meals the school district has been handing out since the pandemic started,"" Perng said.
Lisa Liu, whose two children attend Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland, said she saw little reason
to send them back to classrooms when virtual learning seemed to be working well for them. But fear that
they would face harassment also played into her decision.
""Maybe if they go back, the other kids will say, 'You're the reason we didn't go to school for a year,' "" Liu said.
""I don't want my kids to experience hatred.""
Many in medical fields
But it is not just harassment that families worry about. Asian Americans are overrepresented in medical
fields, making up 6 percent of the population but 18 percent of the nation's doctors and 10 percent of its
nurse practitioners. It means they are more likely to have had firsthand experience with the virus.
Suzanne Lirazan, a 30-year-old nurse from the Philippines who lives in Queens, has seen the devastation of
the pandemic firsthand. She works as a private nurse, and in April the patient she was caring for fell ill after
contracting the coronavirus. She was at his bedside as he took his final breaths. Then she and the rest of the
household fell ill. She was unable to see her 9-year-old son, Gabriel De La Cruz, for an entire month as she
recovered and quarantined.
Lirazan worries her son could bring home the virus from school, a prospect that would not only be dangerous
for her, but for her patients, too.
""It's the fear of him getting sick, and transmission-wise, I don't want to get sick and transmit it with my
patients,"" Lirazan said. ""My son, he's very social, he likes to study in school. But I just can't bring myself to
bring him there.""
Lirazan said that sentiment is common in Filipino communities in New York and New Jersey, where many work
in health-care in jobs that put them in close contact with patients.
Preexisting conditions
For Nancy Lin, a Philadelphia mother of two who was laid off from her restaurant job when the pandemic
struck, the decision to keep her children remote was driven by something else: the school building. According

to her dispatches with other parents over the messaging app WeChat, many other Chinese families are
making the same decision.
They had complaints about the condition of the school even before the pandemic, of mold in the basement,
that bathrooms were dirty, and that heating and cooling systems were not in working order. They are the
same factors that are keeping other families of color - and teachers - out of school buildings.
Their concerns are not unfounded. An investigative series in 2017 by the Philadelphia Inquirer and Daily
News found widespread issues with asbestos and paint laced with lead. When the teachers union pushed
the school system to delay the start date of in-person classes, its leader cited the district's ""absolutely
abysmal track record when it comes to addressing health and safety.""
At Hmong International Academy in Minneapolis, Principal Jamil Payton said only a third of students in
prekindergarten through fifth grade have come back to the school building since they reopened last month.
The school serves a mix of students from the city's refugee communities - Hmong, Laotian, Cambodian and
Sudanese students. There were fewer than 100 students in the building the last week of February, a group
whose demographics roughly matched the school's.
The Hmong community has been hard-hit by the coronavirus. In June, Marny Xiong, a Hmong woman who
chaired of the St. Paul Board of Education, succumbed to the virus at the age of 31, devastating the
Hmong community. Xiong had worked as an administrator at Hmong International Academy and her loss
was felt deeply.
""We were hit like a ton of bricks by the passing of this staff member who was so beloved in our building
and our community,"" Payton said. He believes it is contributing to the reluctance of Hmong families to send
their children back to school buildings.
Swapping information
The decision for almost any family to send their children back to school can be wrenching, as they attempt
to balance the benefits of sending their children back to school with the risks - all while the death toll from
the pandemic mounts. So many are relying on parents from their own communities, swapping information
in group chats to make decisions.
Mehvish Ali, who is Pakistani American, had a lot to weigh when trying to decide whether to send her two
sons back to school in Loudoun County, a Northern Virginia suburb. Her oldest son, a seventh-grader, was
eager to get back to school to see his friends. But he also has a medical condition that makes him more
susceptible to the virus.
She is close with her neighbors, most of whom are Indian American, and her children are friends with their
children. The group chat had become a key source of support and information during the pandemic.
On WhatsApp, the consensus was clear.
""Everybody in the neighborhood that I know of said they were doing distance learning,"" Ali said. It made
the decision easier for her and for her son, who learned his friends would also be staying home from
school.
When it came time for Filipino American Julius Paras to decide whether to send his child back to school
outside San Jose, he and his wife, who is Chinese American, decided to convene a Zoom meeting with
relatives nearby. Many of them had come together as a pandemic pod, allowing the parents to split child-
care duties and the cousins to continue to see each other. They realized sending their children back to
classrooms could shatter their support system and possibly endanger his in-laws, who they visit for socially
distanced picnics in the elderly couple's driveway.

Family and friends have 'been treated pretty terribly,' he tells CNN
Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday morning that anti-Asian harassment during
the coronavirus pandemic has been ""a serious problem"" for his wife, Yumi, an immigrant from South Korea, and
her three adult daughters.
""They have felt some discrimination personally,"" he said on Tapper's State of the Union talk show, describing
experiences within his own family and among their close friends, whom he said have ""been treated pretty
terribly.""
""We feel it personally with my daughter, who sort of is sometimes afraid to come visit us,"" Hogan said, ""with
people who had best friends that were being harassed at the grocery store, or being called names, and people
yelling about the 'China virus,' even though they're from Korea and born in America.""
In 2020, reports of hate crimes were down 7 percent nationally but increased 150 percent against people in the
Asian community, according to a study released this month by the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism
at California State University at San Bernardino, which examined police records in 16 of the country's largest
