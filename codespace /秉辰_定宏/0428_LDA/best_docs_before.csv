Hi everyone! Welcome to the ""This is America"" newsletter. If you don't recognize my name, no worries, because
I'm new here! I'm Jenna Ryu, a Life and Travel editorial intern, and a senior at Georgetown University.
It's the jolly month of December, and we're still living in a revolutionary coronavirus pandemic caused by the so-
called ""China Virus,"" also known by its catchier moniker, ""Kung Flu.""
Funny, right? As punny as it sounds, this wordplay (along with the incessant bat jokes) is just one example of
the normalized racism that's come into the spotlight this year.
Often referred to as the model minority, Asian Americans are praised for things like economic success and work
ethic. The stereotypes: We're hard-working, but we don't bad-mouth the country. We economically outpace
others while staying polite and reserved. We worked our way up to the American Dream without publicly voicing
our struggles with prejudice, racism and discrimination along the way.
It feels like these microaggressions, xenophobia and the whole model minority myth have become normalized to
the point where they are overlooked. And in a year of so much reckoning – yet so much blatant racism against
Asian Americans – it has reached a breaking point for Asian Americans' mental health.
But first: Race and justice news we're watching

Black women and Latina entrepreneurs get less than 1% of venture capital
Gen Yeet: Some testimonies from jobless young adults, and a Q&A on why Gen Z is on Facebook
I should be flattered that I'm stereotyped as ""studious,"" right?
It seems like a compliment to be known as ""hard-working"" and ""good at math,"" right? Better than being
referred to as a ""thug"" or ""bad hombre.""
Here's the thing: The model minority myth inherently raises the standards for Asian Americans – both internally
and externally. It's assumed that because of how we look and where we're from, we should all be able to
achieve great feats without difficulty.
I feel an immense pressure to meet ridiculously high standards that are imposed on Asians, for the fear that if I
don't, I'm automatically ""dumb,"" ""disappointing"" and a ""failure."" Insecurity and self-doubt are all too familiar
when others express shock that math isn't my strong suit, or that my English is surprisingly ""good"" for an Asian.
Dr. Derek Iwamoto, an Asian American counseling psychologist, notes that some Asian Americans may ""crumble
under the pressure"" and experience depression and anxiety when failing to meet expectations such as attending
a prestigious university or becoming a successful doctor.
Asian Americans are three times less likely to seek mental health services compared with their white
counterparts, despite similar rates of depression and anxiety. Iwamoto attributes this not only to cultural
differences, but also the model minority trope, which encourages Asians to be successful while being
independent.
""If you believe all Asian Americans are successful, but you're Asian with unemployment issues, you might not
seek help because you feel you must be self-reliant,"" he said. ""It's hard to live up to an unrealistic notion to
achieve all of these things when it's really difficult given all the barriers Asian Americans experience.""
Asians are not exempt from racism
So let's talk about those ""barriers,"" as Iwamoto calls them.
Assumptions that we're intelligent and successful often overshadow a reality in which our cuisines are seen as
""weird"" and ""smelly,"" or that our eye shape is considered ugly for not conforming to Eurocentric beauty
standards. Worst of all, we're taught that these insensitive behaviors are less serious, and therefore more
acceptable.
When I've complained about those moments of harmful microaggressions, I've been told to shut up.
This summer, in a trend that spanned the country, students and alumni of color at my private high school turned
to Instagram to expose racism we'd experienced on campus.
My voice finally felt heard when I shared my story about a dorm head who made little effort during my first year
to learn my name and mistook me for another Asian girl for over a month.
But my pride in sharing was soon overshadowed. The faculty member's friends and family members began
invalidating my experience, questioning my authenticity and sarcastically mocking what happened and how it
made me feel.
Being told that the appropriate response to racism is to lighten up, laugh and stop being sensitive is a form of
gaslighting. If Asian Americans are so successful, then how could these jokes about eye shape or accents
actually be harmful?

President Donald Trump said he did not believe the term ""kung-flu"" and other discriminatory phrases would put Asian Americans at risk of xenophobic
attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The disparaging term was privately used by a White House official to CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, a Chinese American, on Tuesday morning.
""I wonder who said that,"" Trump said to reporters at the White House on Wednesday. ""You know who said that? Say the term again.""
Trump said he did not believe Asian Americans would be negatively affected by the use of the phrase.
President Donald Trump said he did not believe the term ""kung-flu"" and other discriminatory phrases would put Asian Americans at risk of xenophobic
attacks amid the coronavirus pandemic.
The disparaging term was privately used by a White House official to CBS News reporter Weijia Jiang, a Chinese American, on Tuesday morning.
""Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back,"" Jiang said in a tweet.
Trump pressed for more details when he was asked if he believed Asian Americans could be subjected to increased racist attacks because of similar terms.
""I wonder who said that,"" Trump said to a reporter at the White House on Wednesday. ""You know who said that? Say the term again.""
After the reporter repeated the phrase, it was still not clear if Trump understood the belittling implication and the relationship it has with Asians.
Trump said he did not believe Asian Americans would be negatively affected by the use of the phrase, which he said had to do with coronavirus' origins in
China. Trump and numerous Republican lawmakers have described the coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus,"" based on the initial cases in the country. Critics —
including the Chinese government — have urged them not to use the term.
""No, not at all,"" Trump said. ""I think they'd probably would agree with it 100%. It comes from China. There's nothing not to agree on.""
Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, testified in a congressional hearing earlier in March that he agreed it was
inappropriate to describe the virus as the ""Chinese coronavirus"" because it had spread across the world.
""Public health emergencies ... are stressful times for people and communities,"" the CDC wrote on its website. ""Fear and anxiety about a disease can lead to
social stigma toward people, places, or things.""
""For example, stigma and discrimination can occur when people associate a disease, such as COVID-19, with a population or nationality, even though not
everyone in that population or from that region is specifically at risk for the disease,"" the CDC website said.
Several hate crimes and acts of discriminatory behavior against Asian Americans were documented across the US in recent weeks amid the coronavirus
pandemic. An Asian man who declined to be identified alleged a 44-year-old man named Raoul Ramos screamed at him on Saturday for not wearing a mask
while he was walking with his 10-year-old son in New York, the New York Post reported.
""The guy walked past us. That triggered him. He was screaming at us and said, 'Where the f--- is your mask?'"" the man said to the Post.

A new initiative to beef up hate crime investigations in Minnesota has stalled in the waning days of the state Legislature as lawmakers focus on a budget gap brought on by the
COVID-19 pandemic.
A proposal sparked by State Attorney General Keith Ellison and state Rep. Frank Hornstein, DFL-Minneapolis, would require new statewide training for police, new data collection
policies, criminalize hate-fueled property damage and set up a statewide blueprint for how police should respond to hate crimes.
Growing out of Ellison's statewide tour last year to shine a light on rural and urban hate crimes, the legislation hit a roadblock in recent weeks as lawmakers confront a $2.4
billion deficit stemming from economic dislocations related to the coronavirus.
Ellison said in an interview this week that a recent anti-Asian backlash during the pandemic -- which originated in China -- underscores the bill's urgency.
""I think that there aren't enough people who understand the true dangers associated with being targeted by a hate crime -- particularly for people in the Asian community right
now,"" Ellison said. ""I just think that there are too many people who think, 'Well it's not happening to me so it's not happening and it's not a priority.' And I think that's a crying
shame.""
Hornstein, sponsor of the House bill, said his proposal hit a dead end in the Senate even though it has bipartisan support. GOP state Sens. Karin Housley, of St. Marys Point, and
Paul Anderson, of Plymouth, are co-sponsors of a similar bill introduced by Sen. Ron Latz, a St. Louis Park Democrat.
During a House hearing on the bill last week, some Republican legislators mainly cited fiscal concerns. Hornstein's proposal was expected to cost Minnesota $854,000 next year.
That would pay for five new full-time employees to the Human Rights Department and one to the Peace Office Standards and Training Board. It would also cover improved data
collection and work on a new law enforcement training course.
""I can't vote for this bill because it still has a significant cost and we don't have any money,"" said Marion O'Neill, R-Maple Lake. ""So I would love to vote for this bill, I think it's a
great bill, but unless the Department of Human Rights can just shift staff to do this, I can't support it. It's just too expensive.""
Hornstein, the son of Holocaust survivors, noted that his bill passed its first committee unanimously before the virus hit Minnesota. He also pointed out that GOP opposition in a
House judiciary committee this month stemmed largely from fiscal concerns.
Hornstein described the bill's reporting, training and property crime provisions as a ""comprehensive"" change to how Minnesota responds to hate crimes.
""Those are three significant steps forward and those passed two House committees,"" Hornstein said.
""I think we're well-positioned to build on this success for next year.""
But backers of the legislation say the pandemic continues to highlight the need for quicker action.
Last month, Gov. Tim Walz launched a discrimination helpline over reports of bias against Asian-Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the complaints have
involved people being harassed at grocery stores by other customers.
Another incident involved an Asian-American couple in Woodbury who received an anonymous letter telling them to ""take the chinese virus back to china.""
Ellison said he had to abruptly end a recent Zoom conference call with Hmong community leaders when someone infiltrated the call with blasts of hate-filled messages.
Minnesota law enforcement reported 126 hate crimes to the FBI last year, its lowest total since 2016 and first decrease since 2014.
But nine out of every 10 Minnesota police departments -- including those in cities like Duluth and some of the largest suburban cities -- reported zero bias crimes for the year.

When President Donald Trump stood before the microphone during a White House briefing about the coronavirus on Wednesday in which he declared himself a ""wartime
president,"" it only required a slight adjustment of reality as far as he was concerned.
He had already laid the groundwork in a press conference the day before when he told reporters that contrary to what they had seen, heard and reported for weeks, he never
called the coronavirus a ""hoax.""
""This is a pandemic,"" he said Tuesday. ""I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic. All you had to do was look at other countries.""
Mr. Trump assumed that just because the heads of the reporters didn't explode from the weight of sheer cognitive dissonance, his Jedi mind trick had somehow worked. It
hadn't.
Everyone knew that every word he said was in direct conflict with reality. With several members of the coronavirus task force flanking him, Mr. Trump declared war on an
""invisible enemy"" he could barely acknowledge weeks before.
So on Wednesday, the task force did not applaud or pin epaulettes on Mr. Trump's shoulder, but they did not embarrass him with gentle rebukes for wasting weeks of precious
time that has endangered the public's health, either.
After only a few weeks of working with the Trump administration, these learned men and women have already taken the lessons of George Orwell's ""1984"" to heart: ""The past
was alterable. The past has never been altered. Oceania was at war with Eurasia; therefore, Oceania had always been at war with Eurasia.""
While Mr. Trump's position on the legitimacy of fears concerning the coronavirus could charitably be described as ""fungible"" over time, he and his allies have been remarkably
consistent about one element - the open embrace of anti-Asian xenophobia and racism for geopolitical advantage.
While everyone is keenly aware of Mr. Trump's clumsy attempts to distract from his administration's incompetence in rallying the nation and marshaling its resources to combat
COVID-19, his attempts to racially brand a global disease still can't go unaddressed.
Racism matters. It is only those who have benefited most from the privileges afforded by racism who insist with a straight face that ""rising to the Trump administration's bait""
by even objecting to it at this time endangers the public health.
It is possible to do two things at once - call out the president's incompetence while also pointing out his racism and those of his surrogates who are trying to rebrand COVID-19
the ""Chinese virus"" in the middle of a global pandemic.
Bear in mind, these are members of a political party that, until a few days ago, wasn't willing to entertain the possibility that COVID-19 was anything more than an elaborate
media hoax concocted to embarrass Mr. Trump, tank the economy and steal the election for the Democrats.
Sen. John Cornyn, one of Texas' two Republican senators, spelled it out for a reporter who quizzed him about the cost of demonizing Asians in a land that has been historically
intolerant of them, especially during pandemics.
""That's where it came from,"" Mr. Cornyn said, as if geographic origin was anything more than a twirl of the dice. ""I think China is to blame because the culture where people eat
bats and snakes and dogs and things like that, these viruses are transmitted from the animal to the people and that's why China has been the source of a lot of these viruses
like SARS, like MERS, the Swine flu, and now the coronavirus,"" he said. ""So I think they have a fundamental problem, and I don't object to geographically identifying where it's
coming from.""
Mr. Cornyn and his ilk would've objected strongly if the strain of deadly Creutzfeldt-Jakob bovine disease, otherwise known as ""Mad Cow disease,"" that re-emerged on an
American farm and in Canada in 2003, had been re-dubbed ""North American Mad Cow disease."" That's because the Republican senator and all of those eager to paint a

A rise in hate crimes toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Dodgers manager Dave Roberts to send an email to the entire organization decrying the wave of bullying and violence as ""cowardice.""
Roberts, the son of a Japanese mother and Black father, said the email, the contents of which were first reported by the Athletic on Monday, was prompted not by a specific event but by ""something that was on my heart that needed to be shared."" The five-paragraph note was sent earlier this spring.
""I just think there's a lot of things going on inside and outside of our country toward Asians -- racist, bullying acts,"" Roberts said before Monday's exhibition game against the Chicago White Sox at Camelback Ranch.
""It obviously hit close to home for me, and I wanted to address it internally and show my support for the Asian Americans in our organization ... just [to let them know] we're all aware of it.""
The Times reported last week that in a survey of police departments in 16 major U.S. cities, the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, a research office at Cal State San Bernardino, found a total of 122 anti-Asian hate crimes last year -- a 149% increase from the 49 in 2019.
The numbers climbed in 15 of the 16 cities, with New York, Los Angeles, Boston, Seattle and San Jose experiencing the most significant increases and their highest tallies in at least five years.
The rise in crimes, harassment and bigotry toward Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders is almost certainly related to the COVID-19 pandemic, which originated in China and which former President Trump took to calling the ""Wuhan virus"" and the ""Chinese virus.""
Stop AAPI Hate, a tracker supported by Asian American advocacy groups, logged 1,990 anti-Asian harassment incidents and 246 assault cases in the first 10 months since it launched in March 2020.
""Unfortunately, anti-Asian sentiment is a part of American history (see 1880s, 1940s or the 1980s as examples) and it has resurfaced again during the pandemic, as some seem to blame the world's problems on one ethnic group,"" Roberts wrote in his email. ""To blame Asian Americans at all for the global pandemic is just plain wrong.""
Roberts, who last summer supported his team's refusal to play an August game against the San Francisco Giants in protest of the police shooting of Jacob Blake, a Black man, in Wisconsin, wrote that he was ""proud that the Dodgers organization, with its forward-thinking ways, has transformed its work environment by establishing better ways for all employees to be heard.""
He said Monday that his email was well-received throughout the organization.
""I think a lot of people felt heard and supported, and that was really important to me,"" Roberts said. ""It's not right treating anyone of any race that way.""

The new coronavirus is spreading fast around the world and so is racism against Asian people.
TV personality and Korean-American lawyer Suh Dong-joo, 36, lashed out at the increasing number of racially motivated attacks against Koreans and other Asians in the United
States amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
'Do you want us to wear a mask or not wear a mask? I'm getting mixed messages here,' Suh, who lives in San Francisco, wrote on Instagram. 'If Asians get beat up for both
wearing a mask and not, what do you expect us to do?'
The comment comes five days after she posted the photo of herself wearing a face mask, saying she was concerned about growing racism.
Asians see increase in racially motivated attacks against them
As the virus from the Chinese city of Wuhan continues to affect people around the world, concerns have been growing over xenophobic and racist attacks against people
'whoever look Chinese.'
Earlier in February, a video posted on Twitter of a women wearing a mask being punched, kicked and called a 'diseased b****' by a man in a New York City subway went viral.
On Feb. 24, Jonathan Mok, a 23-year-old Singaporean, was attacked while walking down the streets in London by a group of four men who said: 'we don't want your
coronavirus in our country.' The attack resulted in a broken bone near his eye.
On Mar. 6, another disturbing video was widely circulated on social media, in which a black man sprayed Febreeze air freshener at an Asian guy after having an argument on a
New York City train.

WASHINGTON – Lawmakers representing groups of minority members of Congress and top House Democratic
leaders Friday denounced a ""crisis point"" of attacks against Asian Americans and called for action to prevent
future attacks.
Speaking at a virtual press conference, Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairperson Rep. Judy Chu,
D-Calif., said the Asian American community had ""reached a crisis point that cannot be ignored"" amid reports of
a rise in violence and hate incidents against Asian Americans in the last several weeks.
Chu and other lawmakers said the attacks are part of a rise in anti-Asian American bias and xenophobia amid
the COVID-19 pandemic. Stop AAPI Hate, a group tracking anti-Asian discrimination, said it had received more
than 2,808 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian hate from mid-March 2020 through the end of 2020.
Many of the lawmakers speaking Friday laid the blame at the feet of leaders like former President Donald Trump,
who has blamed China for the pandemic and used derisive terms for the coronavirus. Advocates and Asian
American lawmakers warned the language would inflame anti-Asian American sentiment.
""What started as dirty looks and verbal assaults"" at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic had ""escalated to
physical attacks and violence against innocent Asian Americans,"" Chu said. ""Just as many Asian Americans were
preparing for the Lunar New Year over the past few weeks, we saw a surge in anti-Asian violence.""

3,0.9538879,112,"
WASHINGTON – It has been over a year since Asian American lawmakers first sounded the alarm on a potential
rise in anti-Asian hate and violence amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
Since then, Stop AAPI Hate, which tracks discrimination against Asian and Pacific Island Americans, said it
received more than 3,000 firsthand accounts of anti-Asian American harassment or attacks compared to roughly
100 incidents annually in previous years.
In the beginning, Rep. Grace Meng, D-N.Y., said it was ""important"" to condemn the hate incidents, even if it was
""symbolic."" But as the incidents continued to rise, ""it's time to take it to the next level to make sure that we are
using all the tools in our toolbox to help curb this problem,"" she said.
That includes legislation.
Democratic lawmakers said they would introduce a new bill addressing a rise in hate incidents directed at Asian
Americans amid the coronavirus pandemic. The bill, a revised version of legislation introduced but not passed in
the last Congress, would create a new position at the Department of Justice to facilitate the review of hate
crimes and provide oversight of hate crimes related to COVID-19.
Meng, the lead sponsor of the legislation in the House, told USA TODAY the bill would make it ""easier for us to
have a more complete and accurate picture"" of hate crimes and incidents.
Among other provisions, it would issue guidance for state and local law enforcement agencies to establish their
own hate crime reporting systems and education campaigns about hate crimes, provided in multiple languages.

SAN FRANCISCO – Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the
young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough.
About the series
Racist policies have made Americans of color poorer and sicker. COVID-19 made these inequities deadly. This is
the third in our investigative series deadlydiscrimination.usatoday.com.
""Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?"" asked Amy Rong.
The mother and daughter, along with Rong's parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-
occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways
are cramped, bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the spread of the highly contagious
novel coronavirus.
That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy's forehead, wondering if her child would

die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the
lone sofa bed.
In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless
night. Rong made soup, but Amy wouldn't eat it.
Getting tested for COVID-19 didn't seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were
expensive. Rong also feared the reaction from neighbors.
""If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,"" said Rong. ""Everyone would think you are the devil.""
It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts
a bustling Chinatown, as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians
and Filipinos also have made their homes here. All told, Asians in San Francisco represent upward of 20
countries.
But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with
the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 123 COVID-19 deaths reported by the San Francisco Department of
Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.
Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher
than the 12% reported, a by-product of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes
this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused
segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing,
employment and health.
San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a
time when officials don't know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation's 7.8 million
coronavirus cases. Around 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.
In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language
about testing, safety tips, housing and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the
community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line
employment and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.
""This model minority thing, that's not us,"" said Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian
Development Center, a San Francisco nonprofit that helps area residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
""There is the language barrier and our community is small,"" Young said. ""So the city doesn't think we have any
problems when we do.""
That risk of invisibility is only heightened by the pandemic. Since city health officials do not break down
COVID-19 statistics beyond ""Asian American,"" many advocates for the city's various groups said they are left to
speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities. How many people are
dying, and are those people Japanese Americans? Vietnamese? Filipino?
""There's this feeling that there's excess death out there,"" said Jeffrey Caballero, executive director of the
nonprofit Association of Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. ""That high mortality rate among Asian
Americans means either there isn't enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.""
What is the model minority myth?
For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the corrosive
and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California, San Francisco

professor of medicine.
Nguyen co-authored a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to
the fact that 50% of San Francisco's 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans,
disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.
To be sure, the fortunes and contributions of many Asian Americans have skyrocketed in past decades. The
median annual income of households headed by the nation's 22 million Asian Americans is $73,060,
compared with $53,600 for all U.S. households, according to the Pew Research Center.
A closer look at San Francisco's two dozen Asian ethnicities reveals many groups within this broad
categorization are struggling financially and remain outside the mainstream. About 43% are non-English
speakers, according to a USA TODAY analysis of U.S. census data. About a third of San Franciscans are
foreign-born, and 13% are not U.S. citizens.
""With Asian Americans, the average always is pulled way up by those doing very well, which means you miss
the groups who clearly are not,"" said Margaret Simms, a nonresident fellow with The Urban Institute in
Washington, D.C., who specializes in race and labor economics. The think tank found nearly 13% of Asian
American senior citizens live in poverty compared to a 9% national average.
Discrimination also is keeping some Asian Americans from getting tested for COVID-19. The website Stop
AAPI Hate, the acronym for Asian American Pacific Islander, has logged more than 2,500 incidents of
discrimination across the U.S. since mid-March. The attacks have ranged from verbal assaults to acts of
physical violence.
When Asian Americans hear President Donald Trump, who contracted COVID-19 in October, repeatedly call
the virus the ""China virus"" and ""Kung Flu,"" ""it makes them less likely to seek help, a bit like early in the AIDS
epidemic when the gay community was stigmatized,"" said Karthick Ramakrishnan, professor of public policy
at the University of California, Riverside and chair of the California Commission on Asian and Pacific Islander
American Affairs.
Decades of racist policies
Chinese citizens began passing through San Francisco's then bridgeless Golden Gate en masse during the
Gold Rush of 1849.
By the late 1800s, the Chinese were not just vilified but outright barred from entering the country, with few
exceptions, by the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. White officials charged they were taking jobs from other
Americans, despite having been integral to the Gold Rush's boom and the construction of the Transcontinental
Railroad.
At the height of World War II, Japanese Americans around the country were rounded up and sent to
internment camps, feared as the traitorous ""yellow peril"" after years of citizenship. Despite painful and
humiliating treatment at the hands of the U.S. government, many Asians resolved to engrain themselves in
the society at large with an image of themselves as patriotic, hardworking Americans.
The model minority image gained momentum during the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Asian American
success stories were highlighted by white U.S. officials both as a way of signaling to other nations, namely
the Soviet Union, that America was not racist, but also to shame other ethnic groups, notably Black
Americans.
The logic went that if Asian Americans were doing so well, surely failure on the part of other ethnic groups
was their own fault.

Then came the Vietnam War, a quagmire that resulted in a U.S.-sponsored evacuation of 125,000 refugees
followed by countless others who escaped Southeast Asia in rickety boats. Many landed in San Francisco.
California Assemblymember David Chiu, a Democrat who represents the eastern half of San Francisco and
chairs the California Asian & Pacific Islander Legislative Caucus, said lawmakers must recognize that Asian
Americans are a loosely linked group of immigrants with distinct challenges and needs.
""The attention being paid to the disparities endured during the pandemic by Black and Latinos is important,
but our issue hasn't gotten the attention it deserves,"" he said.
One small demographic victory for Asian Americans came in 1997 when President Bill Clinton directed the
Office of Management and Budget to expand its data classification system to break out ""Native Hawaiian or
Other Pacific Islanders"" from the Asian American group. That geographic list includes countries such as
Micronesia, Tonga, Vanuatu, Guam, the Marshall Islands and Fiji.
As a result, we know today that Pacific Islanders rank third in terms of COVID-19 deaths, behind Native
Americans and Black Americans.
A COVID-19 language barrier
Asian American communities in San Francisco speak a range of languages including Mandarin, Cantonese,
Japanese, Korean, Tagalog, Laotian, Samoan, Tongan, Vietnamese and Hindi. The city's website notes that
COVID-19 information is available in English, Chinese, Filipino and Spanish.
Efforts by city health officials to inform Asian residents about COVID-19 safety precautions and testing in
their native languages have sometimes resulted in confusing or alienating translations.
For example, information about pop-up virus testing sites sometimes can come across as demands, while
in other cases the language is just plain confusing.
One flyer written in the Filipino language of Tagalog told people to ""cover their entire face,"" said Luisa
Antonio, executive director of the Bayanihan Equity Center, a Filipino American support group.
Department of Public Health officials declined an interview request about outreach efforts.
In California, about 5 million of 40million state residents are Asian American, and in three-quarters of
those homes, languages other than English are spoken regularly, according to the U.S. Census.
Even some Asian Americans who speak fluent English said government officials have not made it easy to
get information about the virus.
Huiting ""Rita"" Huang grew alarmed when her mother-in-law told her that there had been a positive
coronavirus case among the Chinese emigres to whom she was providing nursing services. The mother-in-
law was unsure what to do and feared her poor English would make getting information about where to get
tested even harder.
Huang felt confident she could help. Her English was solid and she had experience getting COVID-19
information as a project coordinator and health educator for the nonprofit NICOS Chinese Health Coalition.
After pursuing a series of online testing-site leads through a variety of city- and community-run websites –
all requiring fluency in English – Huang soon learned that there were no available appointments at testing
facilities close to their neighborhood.
Huang eventually found a city-run testing site near Pier 30 along San Francisco Bay. The test was negative.

SAN FRANCISCO – Mandy Rong was terrified her 12-year-old daughter had COVID-19. It was 2 a.m. and the
young girl was hours into a fierce fever and a racking cough.
""Mommy, why are my eyes on fire?"" asked Amy Rong.
The mother and daughter, along with Rong's parents, live in an 80-square-foot windowless single-room-
occupancy Chinatown building that is a home of last resort for many impoverished Asian immigrants. Hallways
are cramped; bathrooms and kitchens are communal. A ripe setting for the spread of the highly contagious
novel coronavirus.
That early March night felt endless. Rong, 42, repeatedly touched Amy's forehead, wondering if her child would
die in the small loft that the two shared. Down below, her father slept on the floor while her mother took the
lone sofa bed.
In the morning, the fever had vanished, only to return a week later. Once again, the family endured a restless
night.

Getting tested didn't seem like an option for the Rongs. The rumor was that the tests were expensive. Rong also
feared the reaction from neighbors. ""If you test positive, everyone would be scared of you,"" she said. ""Everyone
would think you are the devil.""
It is easy to mistake San Francisco for a thriving Asian American haven. The city, which is its own county, boasts
a bustling Chinatown, as well as a popular Japantown. Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, Vietnamese, Indians
and Filipinos also have made their homes here. All told, Asians in San Francisco represent upward of 20
countries.
But many Asian American immigrants in the county lead a fragile existence rendered even more precarious with
the arrival of COVID-19. So far, 38% of the 167 COVID-19 deaths reported by the San Francisco Department of
Public Health are Asian American residents, the most of any ethnicity.
Experts also are concerned that positivity rates among Asian Americans in San Francisco could be far higher
than the 13.5% reported, a byproduct of the decades-in-the-making model minority myth, which characterizes
this ethnic group as financially successful, physically healthy and upwardly mobile. This belief has caused
segments of the Asian American community to long be overlooked when it comes to social services for housing,
employment and health.
San Francisco is one of the few places in the nation tracking data on Asian Americans and COVID-19 deaths at a
time when officials don't know the ethnicity of the person affected in nearly half of the nation's 16 million
coronavirus cases. About 17 million Americans are of Asian descent, or 5.6% of the population.
In many cases, Asian Americans in this city have received imprecise or no information in their native language
about testing, safety tips, housing and other critical care services during the pandemic. At the same time, the
community is struggling with inadequate access to comprehensive health care, the need to keep front-line
employment and growing incidents of anti-Asian hate crimes.
""This model minority thing, that's not us,"" said Judy Young of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a San
Francisco nonprofit that helps area residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.
""There is the language barrier and our community is small,"" Young said. ""So the city doesn't think we have any
problems, when we do.""
That risk of invisibility is only heightened by the pandemic. Since city health officials do not break down
COVID-19 statistics beyond ""Asian American,"" many advocates for the city's various groups said they are left to
speculate about coronavirus infection and death rates within their individual communities.
""There's this feeling that there's excess death out there,"" said Jeffrey Caballero of the nonprofit Association of
Asian Pacific Community Health Organizations. ""That high mortality rate among Asian Americans means either
there isn't enough testing or people are waiting far too long to get care.""
What is the model minority myth?
For many Asian Americans in San Francisco, the high rate of COVID-19 deaths is directly linked to the corrosive
and distorting effects of the model minority myth, said Dr. Tung Nguyen, a University of California, San Francisco
professor of medicine.
Nguyen co-wrote a report in May by the Asian American Research Center on Health that called attention to the
fact that 50% of San Francisco's 31 COVID-19 deaths at that time were among Asian Americans,
disproportionately high considering they make up just over a third of the population.

Authorities are investigating a possible hate crime after a Willamette University student reported being pushed and kicked by two men in
downtown Salem while they allegedly made derogatory comments about her race.
The 21-year-old woman reported she was attacked at about noon Sunday on the corner of Capitol and Chemeketa streets while walking
to Safeway, according to Lt. Treven Upkes, a spokesperson with the Salem Police Department.
On Monday, Willamette University Vice President of Student Affairs and Dean of Students Dr. Lisa Landreman sent an email to the school
community about the incident. ""Today we were horrified to learn about a racially-motivated hate crime involving physical violence and
harassment, targeted at a Willamette student.""
University officials have not identified the student involved. But in the letter, Landreman commented on the rise in violence against Asian
American and Pacific Islander individuals since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
""It's important to acknowledge these crimes and for all members of our community to resist ill-informed, biased perspectives about
Asian people and to denounce this violence,"" she said.
The woman was approached by two men and pushed ""while derogatory comments were yelled at the student about their race,""
Landreman wrote.
The student fell to the ground and one of the suspects allegedly kicked her. She suffered minor injuries, officials said.
The student reported the incident to the Salem Police Department and Willamette University Campus Safety.
The first man is described as 5 feet 6 inches tall with a big build, long curly blond hair and facial hair. He was wearing a gray v-neck shirt
and black snow hat.
The second man is described as 5 feet 11 inches tall with a thin build and thin brown hair. He was wearing a button-down shirt and a
snow hat.
The two men could face second-degree bias crime and harassment charges, Upkes said. Police have not made any arrests.

With coronavirus concerns, stay-at-home orders, financial instability and mounting civil unrest, it is no surprise
that mothers are experiencing intensified anger.
After I wrote a personal essay on mom rage in 2019, strangers on Twitter declared me an unfit mother. But I
expected Twitter-hate. What I did not expect were the many emails I received from mothers around the world,
saying they too struggle with mom rage and my story made them feel less alone.
After the initial flood of emails, a trickle continued over the next six months. Then Covid-19 happened, and with
it, stay-at-home orders. My inbox began lighting up again, illuminating a direct correlation between mom rage
and sheltering in place.
""Mom rage"" is the colloquial term for the unrestrained anger many women experience during pregnancy,
postpartum and beyond.

It is a popular topic these days in a support group for working moms at The Motherhood Center, a clinical
treatment facility in Manhattan that offers services for pregnant and postpartum women. Paige Bellenbaum, a
group facilitator and the center's founding director, said, ""Mom rage is something we talk about all the time.
Social isolation, lack of support, managing high levels of anxiety and stress -- this is the new normal of being a
mother, and during the pandemic in particular.""
Anger and rage are waving red flags hinting at feelings below the surface. Mothers who experience rage may be
feeling alone, unheard, and unsupported, Bellenbaum said. ""But it's so much more powerful to feel angry and
rageful than to touch the vulnerability of what lives behind it.""
Between stay-at-home orders, Covid-19 health concerns, financial instability (or fear of it), and police violence
against Black people, it is no surprise that mothers are experiencing intensified rage above the surface, and
feelings of grief, fear, and loneliness below.
""We're asking all parents, but it's especially moms on the front lines, to try to do 24/7 child care without a break
at the same time that they're trying to often hold down a job,"" said Laura Markham, Ph.D., a clinical
psychologist, parenting coach and author of ""Peaceful Parent, Happy Kids: How to Stop Yelling and Start
Connecting."" ""So, is there more mom rage?"" she asked. ""How could there not be?""
Mom rage expresses itself in different ways. Anya Persaud, who has a 3-year-old and a newborn and lives in
Beacon, N.Y., could pinpoint her fury: ""Raising my voice and walking hard are signs I'm heading from frustration
to rage.""
Virginia Duan, who homeschools her four children, ages 3, 6, 8 and 10, in the San Francisco Bay Area, said: ""It
feels as if I am going to physically explode, like having an out-of-body experience where I cannot seem to
control the litany of invectives flying from my mouth.""
Molly Caro May, who lives in Bozeman, Mont., and is the author of ""Body Full of Stars: Female Rage and My
Passage into Motherhood,"" said of her rage, ""I never hurt anyone, but I was out in the forest throwing rocks at
trees.""
Moms aren't supposed to yell and stomp and throw rocks, and we aren't supposed to share our rage publicly. I
have wondered if I've been able to write openly about mom rage without much reproach because it has become
so commonplace in our lexicon, or if it is because I am white.
Nefertiti Austin, the author of ""Motherhood So White: A Memoir of Race, Gender, and Parenting in America,""
wasn't familiar with the term ""mom rage"" but acknowledged that the intense anger is somewhat universal for
moms. Of Black mothers, Austin said: ""It's tricky for us, because we are already saddled with 'angry Black
woman.' I definitely don't want to be described as having mom rage, because it's not going to play the same if I
say I have it, than if a white mom says she has it.""
Austin added that because of racist stereotypes, Black mothers are under more pressure to appear perfect. With
police violence against Black people, Austin said, Black mothers may have their ""children on a tighter leash than
white parents.""
""The whole 'kids will be kids' thing? We know that that's not true when it comes to our kids. There isn't a lot of
grace for Black children,"" Austin said.
That fear and perfectionism can only add fuel to the mom-rage fire.
Since viewing the video of George Floyd's death, Persuad said her mood and sleep have suffered. ""I've had
overwhelming anxiety and feelings of hopelessness and helplessness.""
Duan said one of the factors affecting her mom rage is ""the trauma of being Asian-American during the

pandemic,"" after some, including President Trump, have blamed China for the coronavirus outbreak. The
attack has led to a surge in xenophobia against Asian-Americans.
It's been a few months since the pandemic began and several weeks since protests against police violence
filled our neighborhoods. All the while, mothers continue to work multiple jobs at once (teacher and mom at a
minimum), and they're exhausted. May said she vacillates between ""this week, we're going to study cities of
the United States"" and ""actually, we're just going to be outside playing with sticks.""
Like May, Duan concedes her bandwidth has been lower since Covid-19. ""I think it goes hand-in-hand with my
resignation,"" she said. ""I'm fine with the kids just messing around and occasionally learning.""
Persaud is having similar throw-up-her-hands moments these days. ""Where before I might have raised my
voice, now I give in,"" she said. She will allow her son to skip a nap or eat with the television on. ""Surely, we
can't yell and scream every day, right?""
This ""laissez faire"" parenting style seems more than warranted during this strange, stuck-at-home period. But
how can mothers fill up their tanks above empty? Is self-care even possible for mothers during the
coronavirus era?
May described her self-care during the pandemic as ""feast or famine."" ""Some weeks, I'm on it,"" she said. ""I
exercise, feed myself beautiful food, get some quiet time, and I feel really good. Other weeks I'm literally
eating butter on bread in the corner of my kitchen eight times a day. It can feel like I just need to get my
basic needs met and everyone is in the way of that.""
When I asked Persaud how she makes time for herself, she answered unequivocally, ""Showers!"" Whitney
Sandoval, who lives in Wichita, Kan., with her 5- and 3-year-olds, will drive to pick up her groceries and then
hang out in her car in the parking lot. ""I listen to music or a podcast, read or just sit in silence. It's the
closest I can get to being alone.""
Eating properly, exercising, showering and getting a little alone time sound like they belong in the ""basic
health requirements"" category as opposed to ""self-care for mothers.""
Even if those bare minimum self-care needs are met, mom rage doesn't just disappear. Rage has something
to say and, according to Dr. Markham, ""Rage doesn't dissipate until it feels heard.""
Ruth King, an educator, life coach, meditation teacher and the author of many books, including ""Healing
Rage: Women Making Inner Peace Possible"" and ""Mindful of Race: Transforming Racism from the Inside Out,""
said: ""Rage sits at the crossroads of personal transformation. Rage is not to be understood as a useless
emotion, empty of knowledge. Rather, rage is fierce clarity and untapped fuel -- when we push rage away, we
can't learn from it.""
Unfortunately, many mothers are doing just that. It is a challenge to find mothers who will talk on the record
for this article. One mom eagerly emailed me about her rage, but then declined being quoted, saying, ""You
know, mom shame.""
Bellenbaum of The Motherhood Center said, ""There's so much guilt that we feel toward ourselves, and a kind
of inner-disappointment that we have these types of feelings at this intensity, especially toward our children.""
It can be challenging for partners living with those who have mom rage to be able to offer compassion and
support, especially during the pandemic, when the emotional bandwidth of all parents is stretched thin.
In support groups at The Motherhood Center, Bellenbaum has seen mothers find the nonjudgmental
witnesses they need in each other. She said, ""When we connect with other women who are having the same
feelings, that sense of community creates an initial and immediate relief.""

6,0.9641441,115,"
ATLANTA – Authorities on Wednesday said a gunman suspected of killing eight people, six of whom were Asian women, at three spas may
have frequented the businesses but that it was too early to determine if the shootings would be considered a hate crime.
At least four of the victims of the Atlanta-area spas shootings were women of Korean descent, South Korea's Foreign Ministry said
Wednesday. Two others were of Asian descent, police said.
Atlanta Police Chief Rodney Bryant said it was too soon in the investigation to say whether the shootings were a hate crime. ""We are just not
there as of yet,"" Bryant said in a news conference early Wednesday.
The suspect, 21-year-old Robert Aaron Long of Woodstock, Georgia, was charged with eight counts of murder Wednesday in all three
shootings. Four of the counts against Long are related to shootings at two spas in Atlanta. The other four are related to shootings at a spa in
Cherokee County.
Long has not been charged with a hate crime, a specific charge that authorities must prove a crime was committed on the basis of race,
color, religion, gender, disability or sexual orientation. He purchased a firearm Tuesday – the day of the attacks – from Big Woods Goods, a
sporting good story in Cherokee County. Matt Kilgo, the shop's attorney, said his clients are ""fully cooperating"" with police. ""Everything they
have will be turned over,"" Kilgo said.
Cherokee County Sheriff Frank Reynolds said Wednesday that Long told authorities that his actions were not racially motivated and that he
had a sex addiction.
""These locations, he sees them as an outlet for him, something that he shouldn't be doing,"" Cherokee County sheriff’s Capt. Jay Baker said.
""He was attempting to take out that temptation.""
All three spas are listed on Rubmaps.ch, an erotic review site that allows users to search for and review illicit massage parlors. The site is the
most popular of its kind, where buyers who call themselves “hobbyists” or “mongers” looking for sex go to find and share information,
according to a study by Polaris, a nonprofit group that operates the National Human Trafficking Hotline.

Aromatherapy Spa and Gold Spa, both in Atlanta, have around 100 reviews, many recent. A review for Gold Spa on March 9 indicated that it
was “full service,” as did a similar review from five days prior. Young's Asian Massage in Acworth, Georgia, has 39 reviews on Rubmaps, the
latest posted in February.
Long's motivations are still being investigated, and a criminal record wasn't immediately found. In 2019, Long's parents reported him missing

when the then-19-year-old ran off with his girlfriend. ""Their son sent them a text stating he was not returning home and wanted a fresh
start,"" the report says.
Authorities note in the 2019 report that his parents said Long was ""not suicidal, did not take any medication, and had no mental illnesses.""
Long never really made an impression in school, a former classmate said.
""He was always very reserved and quiet for the most part,"" said Emily Voigt, who attended elementary, middle and high school with Long.
""Never really stood out and a lot of us (who went to school with him) never really got the chance to know him deeper because he was very
shy.""
Long and his father attended church most Sundays, services during the week and went on mission trips at Crabapple First Baptist Church in
Alpharetta, about 30 miles north of Atlanta, Brett Cottrell, a former youth minister told the Washington Post.
Elders at the church said in a statement that they were “grieved” to learn about the shooting Tuesday and are “heartbroken for all involved.”
Baker said Long indicated he intended to travel to Florida to carry out similar acts at ""some type of porn industry"" there. A 9mm firearm was
recovered from the suspect's car when he was arrested, Baker said.
There's been a rise in anti-Asian attacks. Here's how to be an ally to the community.
A visual timeline: What happened at Atlanta spa shootings
Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said the spas in Atlanta were not on police's radar.
She acknowledged that the shootings are the latest incident in a string of violence nationwide against Asian Americans amid the COVID-19
pandemic.
""This is an issue that is happening across the country. It is unacceptable. It is hateful. It has to stop,"" Lance Bottoms said.
In Cherokee County, the victims were identified as Delaina Ashley Yaun, 33, of Acworth; Paul Andre Michels, 54, of Atlanta; Xiaojie Tan, 49,
of Kennesaw; and Daoyou Feng, 44.
Four others were killed at the two Atlanta spas, but police have not yet identified them.
Michels' younger brother, John Michels, 52, said he believes his brother was ""just in the wrong place at the wrong time."" He said they grew
up with a total of nine siblings in Detroit, riding dirt bikes and spending summer weekends at a lake and getting into mischief together. They
both served in the U.S. Army at the same time and his brother served as an infantryman in the late 1980s.
""I'm the closest in age, so we were basically like twins,"" John said. ""We did everything together growing up.""
John said Paul Michels owned an alarm company in Atlanta, where he and his wife, Bonnie, have lived 26 years. ""He was just a very hard-
working Republican,"" John added, ""and a very strong Trump supporter.""
Even in grief, John insisted on putting out a message to the alleged slayer: ""Although this is a tragedy, I forgive that man and so will Jesus
Christ... I cannot hate him for it. I pray for his repentance.""
What we know about the Atlanta shootings: Suspect arrested after 8 people killed at 3 spas parlors
Stop AAPI Hate, a group that tracks incidents of discrimination and xenophobia against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders, called the
incident an ""unspeakable tragedy.""
""This latest attack will only exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure,"" the group said.
Vice President Kamala Harris, the first African American and South Asian American woman to be elected vice president, called the incident
""tragic.""
""The investigation is ongoing, we don’t yet know, we’re not yet clear about the motive. But I do want to say to our Asian American
community that we stand with you and understand how this has frightened and shocked and outraged all people.""
The shootings first unfolded Tuesday evening in Acworth, about 30 miles north of Atlanta. Baker said five people were shot at Young's Asian
Massage Parlor. Two people were found dead on the scene. Three victims were taken to a hospital, where two later died.
About an hour after the shooting in Acworth, Atlanta police responded to a report of a robbery at Gold Spa in northeast Atlanta. Three women
were found dead there, Atlanta Police Sgt. John Chafee said. While police were responding, there was a report of shots fired across the street
at Aromatherapy Spa, where police found one woman dead, Chafee said.

Shortly after the first shooting, Cherokee County sheriff's officials released photos of the suspect, Reynolds said. Long's family immediately
contacted the department and helped authorities in tracking him.
Reynolds said authorities anticipated the suspect's next moves and called sheriff's officials in Crisp County, who worked with Georgia State
Patrol to stop Long. Long is to be arraigned Thursday morning, Reynolds added.
Lance Bottoms praised the swift coordination among law enforcement agencies.
Youngs Asian Massage, the scene of the first attack, is on a strip mall with five other shops, settled between a salon and a boutique. The
strip is on a busy road lined with similar strips malls.
A smoke shop, record store and tool shop sit farther down the strip. There is a vacant shop between Smoke South and RetroSound
Records.
Rita Barron, owner of Gabby’s Boutique, sits next door to the spa and described the owners and employees as hardworking.
Barron was in the shop with her husband and customers the night of the shooting. One of the bullets was shot through the shared wall,
near the baseboard of a wall lined with jackets for sale.
She said her husband noticed the suspect had been sitting in his vehicle outside the spa for about an hour before the attack.
Barron saw workers run out of the store, so she sent her husband to investigate. When he discovered what happened, they called 911.
She said they were not the first to call 911, and police showed up shortly after.
""I feel confused,"" she said, adding she'd never heard gunshots before and wondered what the noises were.
Barron said she knew several of the victims. Aside from the workers, one of those shot was a customer of hers who was in critical
condition, she said. Another is a waitress at a nearby Waffle House. She was killed.
The two spas in Atlanta, Gold Spa and Aromatherapy Spa, are two of several neighborhood businesses that are frequented during late
nights. Their customers and services remained discreet behind blacked out windows and parking lots behind buildings.
Gold Spa has a blacked-out glass door which prevents visibility from the outside. The windows are concealed by shutters that appear
rusted. At least one set of window covers appear to be held together with duct tape. The only thing visible inside is an LED ATM near the
front entrance.
Mallory Rahman and her 4-year-old daughter, Zara, left flowers on the steps of Gold Spa in Atlanta to pay respects to the young women
who were murdered there the night before.
“I told her that some people were hurt here that should not have been hurt. Some people were hurt by a bad person,” Rahman said. “I
know she’s young, but I also want to teach her from a young age.”
She said her family lives walking distance from the two spas on Piedmont Road, the site of the shootings. While she has not supported the
spas as a customer, she is sickened by the events.
“My mom is in town from out of state and we just cried. It’s just terrible,” Rahman said.
Nearby Aromatherapy Spa, Craig Barnes owns G Salon, a day spa he opened in this Piedmont Heights neighborhood in 1999.
The spas and strip clubs that share the Atlanta thoroughfare with Barnes were here when he arrived more than two decades ago, he said.
The immediate area includes a Mexican restaurant and pizzeria, auto repair shops, medical offices, a psychic and apartment lofts.
“Twenty-one years, no issues,” Barnes said. “I’ve never met anyone, never seen anyone there (at the site of Tuesday’s shooting) in 21
years. They’re quiet. They don’t do business at the same time I do.”
When Barnes shuts his doors to customers at 7 p.m. on weekdays and 6 p.m. on Saturdays, the 24-hour spas are preparing for a rush of
late-night guests.
Shannon Gott, owner of Backwoods Bowstrings, a hunting supply shop north of Atlanta, said Long shopped there about once a year for
arrows, and the store posted a photo of Long this past year on the store's web gallery after he ""harvested an animal"" during deer season.
""Apart from that, I know nothing about this idiot,"" Gott said.
According to Stop AAPI Hate, violence against Asian Americans has sharply increased since March 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic
began. The group said Asian Americans have been blamed for the pandemic and connected the attacks to racist rhetoric from politicians,
including former President Donald Trump.

Celebrities are speaking out about the latest tragedy in the Asian community.
Seven women and one man, most of them of Asian descent, were killed Tuesday night in three Atlanta-area spa
shootings. Two shootings were in northeast Atlanta and the third in Cherokee County. Police arrested 21-year-old Robert
Aaron Long as the suspected gunman. Police said Long told authorities his actions were motivated by a sex addiction,
not race, and he may have frequented some of the spas where the shootings happened.
While police said Long told authorities his actions were motivated by sex addiction, many experts and top Asian
American lawmakers say it's hard not to see racism inextricably tied to the killings due to a recent wave of attacks
against Asian Americans that coincided with the spread of the coronavirus across the United States.
Trevor Noah agrees. The ""Daily Show"" host slammed claims that the shootings weren't racially-charged on his
Wednesday segment.
""Your murders speak louder than your words,"" Noah said.
""Don't tell me that this thing had nothing to do with race, even if the shooter said that. He thinks it had to do with his
sex addiction."" he added. ""This guy blamed a specific race of people for his problems and then murdered them because
of it. If that's not racism then the word has no meaning.""
Trevor also criticized Cherokee County sheriff spokesperson Capt. Jay Baker who said the shooter had a ""bad day"" in a
press conference Wednesday.
""No, yesterday was a 'bad day' for the people who lost their lives. It's always interesting who police try and find the
humanity in,"" Noah said.

What to know about Atlanta shootings: Suspect charged with murder; killings inextricably tied to race, experts say
Olivia Munn, more stars call to #StopAsianHate
Olivia Munn, who recently called out new Teen Vogue editor-in-chief Alexi McCammond for her past racist tweets against
Asians, said she's ""struggling"" with the latest act of violence.
""We are being targeted, we are living in a country that is attacking us simply just for being us,"" Munn said Wednesday
during an interview with Nicolle Wallace on MSNBC's ""Deadline: White House.""
Munn said the Asian-American community needs ""more people to care about us"" and ""amplify"" opposition to such
attacks. She added, ""We need people on social media to denounce this kind of stuff that is happening against us. It’s so
important that we are heard because we have been so invisible for so long.""
She also shared the #StopAsianHate hashtag on Twitter.
Actor Daniel Dae Kim said: ""The race of the person committing the crime matters less than the simple fact that if you
act with hate in your heart, you are part of the problem. And to those with the power to help and yet sit idly by, your
silence is complicity. #StopAsianHate.""
A rise in anti-Asian attacks: Here's how to be an ally to the community
Lana Condor calls for Asian community allies
Some took to social media to spread awareness about the event, with ""To All the Boys I Loved Before"" actress Lana
Condor urging her followers to ""wake up"" and encouraging people to be allies to the Asian community.
""Your Asian friends and family are deeply scared, horrified, sick to their stomachs and wildly angry. Please please please
check in on us, please please please stand with us. Please. Your Asian friend needs you, even if they aren't publicly
grieving on social media.""
Comedian Mindy Kaling urged people to fight against the normalization of anti-Asian rhetoric.
""The targeting of our Asian brothers and sisters is sickening, but not surprising given the normalizing of anti-Asian hate
speech in the past year. We have to #StopAsianHate, enough is enough!""
""Asians are not a monolith,"" Padma Lakshmi tweeted, adding that ""the continent includes around 48 countries and 3
territories, all with unique cultures, food customs and traditions."" But she declared, ""A racist attack against one of us is
an attack against all of us.""
George Takei, Jamie Chung call on leadership for changes
George Takei called the shooting ""a hate crime.""
Takei also urged GOP leaders to ""stop fanning violence with anti-Asian rhetoric."" On March 9, House of Representatives
minority leader Kevin McCarthy shared online COVID-19 resources, but used the term ""Chinese coronavirus.""
""Words have consequences, especially those from our leaders,"" Takei continued. ""Reporters: Ask politicians who trade in
racism if they feel responsible or remorseful for violence committed in the wake of their words.""
Speaking up: Jeannie Mai 'filled with so much anger' over rise of attacks on Asian Americans
Actress Jamie Chung said ""using (Asian Americans) as a scapegoat for a global pandemic"" needs to ""end now.
""These murders and countless acts of violence and the destruction of businesses and white terrorism in our communities
are the direct cause of politicians and leaders fanning the flames of anti Asian rhetoric,"" she wrote on Instagram.
""Historically Asian immigrants have been the scapegoat for others misfortunes.""

She continued: ""It starts by calling it what it is. MEDIA YOU NEED TO DO BETTER, CALL IT WHAT IT IS, DOMESTIC
TERRORISM HATE CRIMES AGAINST ASIANS.""
""Crazy Rich Asians"" star Gemma Chan asked her Instagram followers to ""please pay attention to what is happening,
adding ""don’t be silent.""
""We need to stop the (dehumanization) of Asians. We need to stop the scapegoating of Asians for Covid. We need to
unite against all forms of hate,"" she wrote. ""Please spread awareness, check in on your Asian friends because we are
not ok.""
""Shang Chi"" star Simu Liu described ""feeling overwhelming grief at the senseless murder of 8 people in Atlanta.
""Still much we don't know, but it's clear to me that the shooter specifically targeted Asian women. Praying for the
victims' families, and for my Asian sisters. Action to follow,"" he said.
This is America: Stop gaslighting me with the Asian 'model minority' myth
Kahmora Hall, a Season 13 contestant on ""RuPaul's Drag Race"" wrote, ""Every day I worry about if it were my parents,
sisters, cousins & friends in that heartbreaking situation. My thoughts and prayers go out to the victims and their
families. #STOPAsianHate.""
Celebrities 'stand in solidarity' with the Asian community
Pharrell Williams tweeted a post writing, ""Enough is enough. Last night was another instance of innocent lives being
lost to domestic terrorism. We must protect our Asian brothers and sisters.""
Singer Rihanna posted a tweet calling the Atlanta shooting ""brutal, tragic"" and ""disgusting."" ""AAPI hate has been
rampantly perpetuated & it’s disgusting! I’m heartbroken for the Asian community & my heart is with the loved ones
of those we lost,"" she wrote.
""There is no place for racism, violence, prejudice, or misogyny of any kind, towards any one,"" Jimmy Fallon tweeted.
Camilla Cabello, who had been accused in 2019 of using racial remarks and has since apologized, tweeted: ""We need
to do everything in our power to stand up against hate. Listen to the AAPI community, take their direction, share
resources if you can.""
Kim Kardashian West said ""Asians are human and deserve to be treated as such.""
Her mother, Kris Jenner, added: ""I stand in solidarity with the Asian community, and with any individuals who feel
attacked or marginalized because of the color of their skin. We are one world, one humanity, and one community.""
John Legend said he is ""sending love to all the loved ones of those whose lives were taken.
""Absolutely horrible,"" the ""All of Me"" singer wrote in response to Tuesday night's shooting. ""Our nation needs to
reckon with the increased threats being directed at our Asian-American brothers and sisters.""
""This escalation of attacks on Asian Americans is horrifying. STOP IT. Stop this sickness America. Stop this brutality,""
Patricia Arquette tweeted.
Alyssa Milano showed her support by writing that she stands with the Asian American and Pacific Islander community,
and singer Sara Bareilles described hate toward Asian Americans as ""loud,"" ""exhausting"" and ""destructive.""
""The Asian hate crime tonight in Atlanta-Buckhead and Cherokee County is just so (expletive) appalling and so sad,""
Florence Pugh wrote on her Instagram story.
""Everytime (sic) there's a mass shooting it's so heartbreaking and so destructive and yet America just shakes it's (sic)
head as if that's just part of being in America and carries on. It doesn't have to be. This was targeted. This is white
supremacy. This was targeted Asian murder.""

""José Alfredo Reyes’ wife and son pulled on personal protective gear and entered his San Diego hospital room.
'Can you hear us?' Margarita Reyes said. Her husband’s eyes remained shut, but his body twitched.
""She leaned in low to his ear and told him that his elderly mother, his children and his grandchildren would all be

""Ten minutes later, José Alfredo Reyes, 59, was dead.""
This is how our story on Latino farmworkers dying of COVID-19 begins. It is heartbreaking. Raw. Real. And a
story happening over and over all across the United States, but particularly in communities of color.
Journalists have been reporting this fact since the start of the pandemic. Communities of color have
disproportionately more cases, more hospitalizations, worse outcomes and more deaths. People of color make
up the majority in 62% of counties with the highest COVID-19 death rates, according to data compiled by USA
TODAY.
In pandemic stories, you'll read this phrase, ""COVID, which disproportionally impacts communities of color,.... ""
But this tragic fact deserves far more than a clause. We set out to trace the root causes. What systems, policies
or decisions created such risk?

Reporters detailed the redlining that clustered Black families around a chemical plant in Louisiana. The poor
working conditions that led to outbreaks among Latinos in California's Imperial Valley. The chronic and historic
neglect that created anemic Native American healthcare systems in New Mexico. The discrimination and
language barriers that stop Asian Americans from getting tested or seeking help in San Francisco. The housing
segregation that forced many Black families into cramped apartments, multigenerational homes and housing
projects in New Jersey.
What they found: Systemic racism was the common preexisting condition.
Deadly discrimination.
""Melvina Musket stared at her dying father through the cellphone screen. His mouth hung open, his eyes were
clamped shut and a beard covered his chin. She heard nurses crying in the background. 'Jesus is waiting for
you,' she told him.""
This is the lede of our story on the reasons behind the spread of COVID-19 in McKinley County, New Mexico. The
county ranks first in the state and sixth nationally for COVID deaths per capita. Roughly 74% of McKinley
County’s 71,367 residents are non-Hispanic Native American, mostly Navajo and Zuni.
A few weeks after Musket said those words to her father, he was dead. Her mother would die five days after
him.
""When people get sick with COVID now, they just talk about 'Well, they had preexisting conditions,'"" said Alan
Gomez, one of the reporters on the project wrapping up this week. ""The amazing thing was figuring out why and
going back in history and kind of putting together those dots, what they did 50, 60, 70, 80 years ago that set
these people up to have those diminished health conditions.""
Investigating the history that led us today was a challenge, so was getting people to tell their stories.
""A lot of people did not want to talk,"" said Marco Della Cava, who explored COVID in San Francisco's Asian
American community. ""There's a stigma associated with even suggesting you might have been near somebody
with COVID, it might imply your job would be in jeopardy, your immigration status.""
Rick Jervis contacted dozens of people impacted by COVID to get to the four or five who would talk with him in
Reserve, Louisiana, in an area known as ""Cancer Alley.""
The story of Karen Wilson sticks with him, because of how sudden it was. She was talking to her younger
brother, Jules Duhe, about having dinner, going to a New Orleans Saints game. ""And it was literally like one day
to the next he had trouble breathing. He goes to the hospital. Within days he was on a ventilator and that's the
last she ever heard from him,"" Jervis said.
""These are not just numbers on a page. These were actual humans who have lost people really, really close to
them. And that involves a lot of human pain. It was really tough to do.""
Reporter Deborah Berry saw the pain, but also found hope as she reported from Essex County, New Jersey.
""Despite the hurt and the fear, the pastors, the activists, the mayor, the funeral director, the tenant association
leaders, stepped up to help their communities, to help families, to help themselves,"" she said.
""There was power in that and hope in that. (Videojournalist Jarrad Henderson) and I cried with some of them,
but we also smiled and took deep breaths as we watched hundreds of city workers pack up food for families and
church volunteers line up people to get free testing. These communities are still struggling, yet they were
holding on to hope. We left hopeful.""

7,0.9409655,118,"
On my walks through pre-pandemic Shanghai in late September 2019, around every corner I stumbled upon
everyday scenes of older people’s integration into the fabric of the city and community life.
People with full heads of gray hair rode bikes and sat in front of storefronts, chatting with neighbors and eating
meals from large metal bowls. An old woman whizzed by in a motorized wheelchair alongside scooters in the
street. At Fuxing Park, grandpas tended to grandchildren and older men bounced spinning disks in a game of
diabolo.
After three days of walking around Shanghai’s teeming streets, I rested my weary feet at Jing’an Sculpture Park.
An old man glanced at me writing in my notebook and struck up a conversation in English. He’d studied English
in the United States and wanted to know how old I thought he was. 70, I guessed. He threw his head back and
smiled. 85. He lived nearby and came to the park every day.
Asian elders in America are vulnerable
Such postcards echo similar scenes in Asian neighborhoods across the United States. They remind me of older
men smoking, chatting and sipping warm beverages in a plaza near San Francisco’s Japantown and a trio of
elders gathered for morning calisthenics in North Beach’s Washington Square. They spark sweet memories of
the elders I saw before the pandemic who danced at Portsmouth Square in Chinatown, reminding me that I’ve
not danced with my hula class in a year. Many Asian American and Pacific Islander elders in my hlau modeled
aging with joy, smiling as they danced through aches and pains and weathered the loss of relatives and friends.
Public outings carry extra danger for Asian people, with a spate of recent attacks targeted against Asian elders
that have resulted in racial trauma, injury, and death. In the Bay Area, viral videos showed the senseless killing

of an 84-year-old Thai man named Vicha Ratanapakdee, thrown violently to the ground in San Francisco. Days
later, another video surfaced of a 91-year-old man also shoved in Oakland’s Chinatown. Other violence against
Asian elders has involved robbery, such as the ambush of a 67-year-old man in San Francisco laundromat and
75-year-old Pak Ho robbed and killed in Oakland during his morning walk last week.
Volunteer escorts have sprung up to assist Asian elders, along with other DIY community safety efforts such as
hiring private armed security guards and providing shopkeepers with air horns. But they aren’t a cure-all, and
public safety depends on sustained government support and commitment.
COVID: Forget about the frenzy over COVID-19 variants, viral evolution is normal
These attacks haven’t occurred in a vacuum but have intersected with rising violence and economic insecurity.
Desolate cities and empty retail spaces from businesses that haven’t survived the COVID pandemic mean fewer
“eyes on the street,” increasing danger for everyone, but especially Asian elders who may be perceived as
vulnerable. Decades of structural racism and community disinvestment have exacerbated the pandemic’s acute
economic devastation and increasing gun violence across the country.
Russell Jeung, San Francisco State University Professor and co-founder of Stop AAPI Hate, has pointed to
community disinvestment in areas with Asian residents, “We live in multiracial neighborhoods with high crime
rates and in these neighborhoods everybody is attacked, everybody is vulnerable...on a day to day basis in
these high crime neighborhoods, pretty much every racial group is a target. We need more opportunities and
more resources in these under-resourced communities like mine.”
'Bullets flying by your house'
Re-imagining community safety doesn’t mean flooding streets with police officers. It does mean investing in
jobs, educational opportunities, health care and affordable housing that make healthy communities, and
programs to promote public safety such as non-police community ambassador programs and violence reduction
efforts targeted towards young people.
In Oakland, pandemic closures of schools and community spaces have hampered community violence
prevention programs. Recently, for the first time in a year I saw teenagers doing football drills on a gleaming
new field at Fremont High School, benefiting the school’s mostly Black and brown student body. I felt safer
witnessing this small but important step forward.
“Even if you’re not directly impacted, having bullets flying by your house is traumatic,” says Loren Taylor, a city
council member representing East Oakland. Last month I experienced this trauma during a quiet Sunday
afternoon interrupted by the firecracker sound of spraying bullets across the street from my Oakland home. No
one was harmed, but as I watched police officers place at least 10 yellow evidence markers near bullet casings,
I worried about the Chinese grandmother who often sits with her grandson on the porch of their
intergenerational home two doors down. Fortunately, she was safe.
'China virus' redux: For Trump and Republicans, it's open season on Asian Americans like me
Racism and violence are twin public health crises that require a response as urgent as our investment in COVID
vaccine development. Living in a fortress is not a solution, nor should we expect anyone to restrict their
activities and movement due to fear and racism. In this tense time we mustn’t lose sight of public acts of
interracial solidarity, such as rallies against anti-Asian violence. We have a collective interest in safe public
spaces and communities free from racial harm.
When vandals destroyed treasured cherry blossom trees outside San Francisco’s Japanese Cultural Center in
January, I reflected on how much we have already lost to hate. The community raised funds for replacements,
but unless we root out the seeds of hate, we will be replanting trees and mourning lives needlessly lost for

As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the state and the country last year, the number of anti-Asian bias incidents —
which includes shunning, racial slurs and physical attacks — went up by nearly 75% within the past year, data released by
the New Jersey State Police show.
COVID-19's origin in Wuhan, China, has caused a significant backlash against Asian Americans across the United States for
the past year and New Jersey has seen its fair share of discrimination toward Asian Americans, said U.S. Rep. Andy Kim, an
Asian American Democrat representing New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District.
Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic did not start this new trend of discrimination toward the Asian American community,
but rather gave people an ""excuse"" to target them and highlights the long history of bigotry against them.
""I believe those statistics are being under-reported and that discrimination against Asian Americans in our country existed
far before COVID-19 and it will last after COVID-19,"" Kim said.

Anti-Asian bias reports, which involve Asian or Pacific Islander individuals, jumped 74%, from 39 in 2019 to 68 in 2020
across the state, according to preliminary data compiled from the New Jersey State Police. However, these statistics are
based off what is only reported to police, as experts and officials believe there are more cases that go underreported.
""I am terrified,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and a Shanghai native who lives in
Cherry Hill. ""I think a lot of my friends feel the same way, you know, is this safe anymore? Yes, a lot of these attacks you see
happening in the city, but if it doesn't stop, is it going to happen tomorrow or a year down the road in the suburbs?""
Here is a breakdown of reported bias incidents against Asian Americans by county across New Jersey:
Bergen: 14
Burlington: 1
Camden: 2
Essex: 1
Gloucester: 1
Hudson: 4
Mercer: 7
Middlesex: 14
Monmouth: 10
Morris: 1
Passaic: 2
Somerset: 5
Sussex: 1
Union: 3
Warren: 1
Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Ocean, and Salem counties did not see any incidents of bias against Asian
Americans over the past year, according to New Jersey State Police. The report did not specify type of incident by county.
Asian Americans reside in all 21 counties and in every part of the state. There are approximately 960,000 Asian American
residents, or 10% of the total New Jersey population.
The number of reported incidents seem to track by population: In Middlesex County, about 25% of the total county
population is Asian American as of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bergen has an Asian population of 16%,
while Hudson, Somerset, Mercer and Monmouth have populations of more than 10%.
Across New Jersey, bias incidents among all groups — not just Asian American and Pacific Islanders — involving aggravated
assault rose by 18% from 2019 to 2020. Incidents involving a tactic of intimidation rose by 7.5%, while terroristic threats
skyrocketed by more than 103% from 32 reports in 2019 to 65 made in 2020.
The State Police report also detailed an increase in incidents targeting Black, Latino and LGBTQ communities, showing that
incidents of harassment and discrimination rose for the second straight year. In 2020, New Jersey recorded 1,441 bias
incidents, which was the highest total ever recorded and a 45% increase from 2019's total.
But nothing stood out more than incidents involving harassment, as New Jersey saw an increase of more than 72% in this
category — 421 in 2019 and then up to 726 incidents in 2020. Additionally, ""other"" forms of bias incidents, which includes
desecration of venerated objects, significantly rose by more than 278%, from 34 to 129 this past year.
For all race groups across New Jersey, simple assaults fell by about 4%, while bias incidents involving destruction, damage or
vandalism to one's property fell by 3.5%, according to the annual report.

Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate (Stop AAPI Hate), a nonprofit organization in California, recorded 3,795 incidents
of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States — a 26% increase from the prior year's 2,808 incidents. Some 42% of
the incidents were reported by Chinese Americans.
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were all in the top 10 for most reported incidents, the group's data showed.
Between March 19, 2020, through Feb. 28 of this year, shows that more than 500 incidents took place so far.
Below is a breakdown of the top 10 states with highest number of bias incidents against Asian Americans over the past year,
according to Stop AAPI Hate's report:
California: 1,691
New York: 517
Washington: 158
Texas: 103
Pennsylvania: 97
Massachusetts: 96
Illinois: 92
Florida: 59
New Jersey: 59
Maryland: 51
The most common types of discrimination involved harassment and shunning, which made up 68% and 20.5% of the group's
reports.
Physical assault was the third-most common category, making up 11% of the total incidents across the country. A quarter of
the incidents took place on public streets, while a third of the incidents occurred at businesses.
""I think the (COVID-19) pandemic and, the discrimination that we've seen, has been pouring gasoline on the fire over the
last year,"" Kim said. ""It's disturbing and I truly also believe that these numbers do not reflect the totality of what is going

COVID-19's impact
Asian history experts say the issue of harassment is nothing new for the Asian community, as a majority have dealt with
discrimination for decades. But there have been several high-profile incidents, such as the recent shootings in Atlanta-area
spas on March 16, in which six of the eight victims were Asian women, that have played a large part in highlighting the
issue.
Last March, a New York City man attacked a 65-year-old Asian American woman in broad daylight and hurled anti-Asian
insults at her as she walked down a midtown Manhattan street, according to New York City police.
The woman was later hospitalized with serious injuries after the attacker punched, kicked and stomped on her as staff and
bystanders did not intervene the incident. NYPD called the incident ""a hate crime assault,"" which later prompted a large
outcry amongst the Asian community for justice and change.
Earlier this month, Jonathan Russo, 27, was charged with multiple counts of assault and harassment, both as a hate crime,
in connection with pushing a 64-year-old Asian American woman on a sidewalk and knocking her down in New York,
assaulting a 32-year-old Asian American woman by grabbing her hair, and shoving a 77-year-old Asian American man to the
ground.
Richard Chen, 40, a web producer and a board member for the Asian American Action Fund, said anti-Asian discrimination is
nothing new across the tristate area, saying that even though he would often see people staring at him when the pandemic
first started, he believes many others have had it far worse in years past.

""Discrimination toward (Asians) has always been there, especially in New York,"" said Chen, a resident from Branchburg in
Somerset County. ""Sure, we usually get those typical stares because of where the virus started, but those who have been
harassed or assaulted because of it is completely unacceptable and is likely going to continue to be honest.""
Jennifer Ho, a professor of Asian American studies at University Colorado of Boulder and the director of Humanities and Arts,
said this topic is the story of the moment, and that the pandemic has only given people another reason to attack this
community.
Ho emphasized the recent violent attacks at Asian American seniors and women throughout the first few months of this year,
specifically videos that have surfaced across the mainstream media, has likely led to the increase of reports recorded by the
Stop AAPI Hate nonprofit organization.
""I want to say that with the violence we're seeing now and with all the racism and the videos that came out last year against
African Americans, the reports are increasing because of the national attention it is receiving,"" Ho said. ""Prior to this year,
when was the last time you honestly saw this much attention on racism against Asian Americans?""
Additionally, the report released by the AAPI anti-hate organization also showed that Asian women made up 68% of the total
incidents, compared with men, who made up 29% of all incidents recorded.
In the Stop AAPI Hate report, victims of anti-Asian harassment sent in their stories to the organization, which included one
Filipino American woman reporting that while in a Washington, D.C., metro station with her boyfriend, an unknown man
shouted at her ""Chinese b----,"" then proceeded to cough at the couple and physically threaten them.
It didn't begin with the pandemic
In 1871 in Los Angeles, around 500 white and Hispanic people murdered 19 Chinese residents in the so-called Chinese
massacre — a buildup of a growing anti-Asian culture that played a part in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, which banned
the immigration of Chinese laborers. It was the nation's first set of immigration laws to ban individuals based on race.
Japan's bombing on Pearl Harbor in 1941 resulted in the internment of most Japanese Americans across the West Coast to
barracks and camps in remote areas during World War II, with the federal government deeming them a possibly disloyal
security risk. Over 127,000 Japanese Americans were placed in camps in the United States during the war and over 1,800
died in the camps.
Jason Oliver-Chang, a professor at the University of Connecticut whose research focuses on Asian American studies and
American immigration history, said Asian Americans were used as a racial wedge after World War II and the Vietnam War.
""Japanese Americans were used as a racial wedge in the '40s and '50s, as with an American allied victory in World War II,
there was then a need to claim victory at home as well,"" Oliver-Chang said. ""People at this time were arguing to fight
fascism abroad and fascism at home and in some respects, people looked to the recovery of Japanese Americans from the
incarceration experience during World War II, as evidence of the United States overcoming the color line.""
Oliver-Chang said even though the Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s played a major step in overcoming the racial barriers
in the United States, Asian American voices still did not receive as much attention.
""I think it helps to explain some of the absence of Asian American voices during these time periods because Asian Americans
were drawing from the harsh treatment and atrocities happening in Japan, Vietnam and in Southeast Asia, to inform others
of their own treatment in the United States,"" Oliver-Chang said.
Congressman Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, said he has also had his fair share of experiences with racism and
discrimination, but is more concerned about how much longer this issue will continue.
""There are a number of instances that really stick out, but I think what Asian Americans often feel is just this perpetual and
constant and rhythmic erosion of belonging that takes its toll,"" Kim said. ""I think it worries me and others, not just about
how we get through this moment and are we safe, but where are we heading as a country in this direction.""
What's being done
Experts and advocates agree the rise in Asian American attacks in 2020 became more prevalent after President Donald
Trump began to routinely refer to the COVID-19 pandemic as the ""China virus.""

As the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the state and the country last year, the number of anti-Asian bias incidents —
which includes shunning, racial slurs and physical attacks — went up by nearly 75% within the past year, data released by
the New Jersey State Police show.
COVID-19's origin in Wuhan, China, has caused a significant backlash against Asian Americans across the United States for
the past year and New Jersey has seen its fair share of discrimination toward Asian Americans, said U.S. Rep. Andy Kim,
an Asian American Democrat representing New Jersey's 3rd Congressional District.
Experts say the COVID-19 pandemic did not start this new trend of discrimination toward the Asian American community,
but rather gave people an ""excuse"" to target them and highlights the long history of bigotry against them.
""I believe those statistics are being under-reported and that discrimination against Asian Americans in our country existed
far before COVID-19 and it will last after COVID-19,"" Kim said.

Anti-Asian bias reports, which involve Asian or Pacific Islander individuals, jumped 74%, from 39 in 2019 to 68 in 2020
across the state, according to preliminary data compiled from the New Jersey State Police. However, these statistics are
based off what is only reported to police, as experts and officials believe there are more cases that go underreported.
""I am terrified,"" said Nina Gao, president of the Asian American Alliance of South Jersey and a Shanghai native who lives in
Cherry Hill. ""I think a lot of my friends feel the same way, you know, is this safe anymore? Yes, a lot of these attacks you
see happening in the city, but if it doesn't stop, is it going to happen tomorrow or a year down the road in the suburbs?""
Here is a breakdown of reported bias incidents against Asian Americans by county across New Jersey:
Bergen: 14
Burlington: 1
Camden: 2
Essex: 1
Gloucester: 1
Hudson: 4
Mercer: 7
Middlesex: 14
Monmouth: 10
Morris: 1
Passaic: 2
Somerset: 5
Sussex: 1
Union: 3
Warren: 1
Atlantic, Cape May, Cumberland, Hunterdon, Ocean, and Salem counties did not see any incidents of bias against Asian
Americans over the past year, according to New Jersey State Police. The report did not specify type of incident by county.
Asian Americans reside in all 21 counties and in every part of the state. There are approximately 960,000 Asian American
residents, or 10% of the total New Jersey population.
The number of reported incidents seem to track by population: In Middlesex County, about 25% of the total county
population is Asian American as of 2019, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Bergen has an Asian population of 16%,
while Hudson, Somerset, Mercer and Monmouth have populations of more than 10%.
Across New Jersey, bias incidents among all groups — not just Asian American and Pacific Islanders — involving aggravated
assault rose by 18% from 2019 to 2020. Incidents involving a tactic of intimidation rose by 7.5%, while terroristic threats
skyrocketed by more than 103% from 32 reports in 2019 to 65 made in 2020.
The State Police report also detailed an increase in incidents targeting Black, Latino and LGBTQ communities, showing that
incidents of harassment and discrimination rose for the second straight year. In 2020, New Jersey recorded 1,441 bias
incidents, which was the highest total ever recorded and a 45% increase from 2019's total.
But nothing stood out more than incidents involving harassment, as New Jersey saw an increase of more than 72% in this
category — 421 in 2019 and then up to 726 incidents in 2020. Additionally, ""other"" forms of bias incidents, which includes
desecration of venerated objects, significantly rose by more than 278%, from 34 to 129 this past year.
For all race groups across New Jersey, simple assaults fell by about 4%, while bias incidents involving destruction, damage
or vandalism to one's property fell by 3.5%, according to the annual report.

Stop Asian American Pacific Islander Hate (Stop AAPI Hate), a nonprofit organization in California, recorded 3,795 incidents
of anti-Asian discrimination across the United States — a 26% increase from the prior year's 2,808 incidents. Some 42% of
the incidents were reported by Chinese Americans.
New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania were all in the top 10 for most reported incidents, the group's data showed.
Between March 19, 2020, through Feb. 28 of this year, shows that more than 500 incidents took place so far.
Below is a breakdown of the top 10 states with highest number of bias incidents against Asian Americans over the past
year, according to Stop AAPI Hate's report:
California: 1,691
New York: 517
Washington: 158
Texas: 103
Pennsylvania: 97
Massachusetts: 96
Illinois: 92
Florida: 59
New Jersey: 59
Maryland: 51
The most common types of discrimination involved harassment and shunning, which made up 68% and 20.5% of the
group's reports.
Physical assault was the third-most common category, making up 11% of the total incidents across the country. A quarter
of the incidents took place on public streets, while a third of the incidents occurred at businesses.
""I think the (COVID-19) pandemic and, the discrimination that we've seen, has been pouring gasoline on the fire over the
last year,"" Kim said. ""It's disturbing and I truly also believe that these numbers do not reflect the totality of what is going
on.""

A Louisiana pastor prays as his parishioners die, first from cancer and now from COVID-19. An Indigenous community in New Mexico lacks adequate health care as the death toll mounts. A
sick hospital worker in New Jersey frets about infecting others in her heavily populated neighborhood.
As the country cries out for a vaccine and a return to normal, lost in the policy debates is the reality that COVID-19 kills far more people of color than white Americans. This isn't a matter
of coincidence, poor choices or bad luck — it's by design.
A team of USA TODAY reporters explored how the policies of the past and present have made Black, Asian, Hispanic and Indigenous Americans prime targets for COVID-19. They found:
America's education and economic systems are still unequal, disproportionately leaving people of color out of higher-wage jobs. When COVID-19 struck, more people of color were serving
as essential workers directly in the path of the virus.
Decades of discrimination in housing corralled people of color into tightly packed neighborhoods, fueling the virus' spread. Those neighborhoods tend to lie in ""food deserts,"" leading to
diabetes, obesity and heart disease that make people more likely to die from the virus.
Environmental policies designed by white power brokers at the expense of the poor has poisoned the air they breathe, fueling cancers and leaving communities weakened in the path of the
virus. A lack of federal funding left the most vulnerable communities cut off from healthcare at the most critical moment.
Put simply, America's history of racism was itself a preexisting condition.
Of the 10 U.S. counties with the highest death rates from COVID-19, seven have populations where people of color make up the majority, according to data compiled by USA TODAY. Of the
top 50 counties with the highest death rates, 31 are populated mostly by people of color.
""COVID-19 has brought out into the open, with painful clarity, these divisions in our society that have been there for a long time but, for one reason or another, people were able to
overlook them,"" said Philip Landrigan, director of the Global Public Health Program at Boston College.
With nearly 1,000 people a day dying from the virus and scientists scrambling to grasp exactly how the virus spreads and kills, federal and state data has not provided enough demographic
detail to show the full impact on communities of color. The race and ethnicity of people who contract the virus is known in 52% of cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
But study after study has shown clear patterns in whom the virus kills.
Black people are more than twice as likely to die from the virus than white people, and Hispanics and Native Americans are 1.5 times more likely to die, according to The COVID Tracking
Project.
""You can't change the fact that America is so segregated and that people of color tend to live in communities where the environmental conditions are worse, and that can increase your risk
of heart disease or lung disease and diabetes,"" said Richard Besser, former acting director of the CDC and president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the nation’s largest
philanthropy dedicated solely to health care. ""You can't change that in the short run.""
A team of USA TODAY reporters pored over lawsuits challenging housing and health care policies, analyzed demographic data for communities hit hardest by COVID-19 and studied
documents that reveal how government and business leaders worked together to marginalize populations. They interviewed the descendants of enslaved Americans who were denied
homeownership in white neighborhoods and Indigenous Americans who had been funneled into reservations in exchange for federally funded health care that never came. They walked
through Black communities on the fence line of polluting chemical plants, spent time with Latino farmworkers unable to afford the very food they harvested, and entered the homes of Asian
immigrants afraid of being attacked by neighbors if they tested positive for the coronavirus.
Housing policies speed spread of virus
In Essex County, New Jersey, decades of housing policies, laws and unspoken pacts excluded communities of color from spacious suburbs and forced them to cram into poor, often
neglected neighborhoods in the urban core of Newark. Now, Essex has the 12th-highest death rate from COVID-19 in the country, according to data compiled by USA TODAY, fueled in large
part by the high numbers of Black Americans living in segregated, low-income neighborhoods.
That includes Ahou Yao, 40, a respiratory therapist at a local hospital who contracted COVID-19 in April and was forced to self-isolate in her bedroom in the two-bedroom apartment she
shares with her husband and two young boys. She struggled from fever, shortness of breath and body aches and was unable to work for a month. Her husband had to go out for food, run
errands and navigate their crowded neighborhood.
""Now I'm scared,"" she said, ""scared that he has it, too.""
Her husband has since developed a cough and chest pains, prompting a trip to the emergency room. He started self-isolating, passing the responsibility of venturing outside back to his
wife.

In Louisiana, along a stretch of the Mississippi River between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, former slave plantations house massive chemical plants that spew chemicals deemed
dangerous by the Environmental Protection Agency. When the plants were constructed, white homeowners had the means to move away, in time leaving a mostly Black population to
breathe toxic air and suffer from such high rates of cancer that the entire region was dubbed ""Cancer Alley.""
One of those plants, in St. John the Baptist Parish, is the only one in the nation that produces neoprene. The synthetic rubber is used to make wetsuits and laptop cases, and the emissions
from the production process are so harmful that the EPA lists the predominantly Black neighborhood next door to the plant as having the highest risk of cancer in the entire country. In
September, St. John the Baptist Parish had the 27th highest death rate from COVID-19 in the nation, according to a USA TODAY analysis.
The Rev. Lionel Murphy of the Tchoupitoulas Chapel, which sits 2 miles from the chloroprene plant, has counseled many Black families over the years as they’ve come down with diabetes,
respiratory illnesses and rare cancers. Now, he’s seeing his neighbors die from COVID-19. And still, smoke billows from the plant down the road.
""People get sick, people die, you go bury them,"" Murphy said. ""But there’s no fight to erase the problem.""
Health care missing when needed
In McKinley County, New Mexico, many locals struggle to find health care.
Year after year, Congress has failed to allocate enough money to fulfill its legal obligation to provide health care to Indigenous tribes, including the Navajo, Hopi and Zuni people who make
up the majority of McKinley County’s population. A 2018 report from the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights titled ""Broken Promises"" found the federal government spends nearly four times as
much on health per person through government programs than it spends for each Indigenous person.
That helps explain why McKinley County has the nation's sixth-highest death rate from COVID-19, according to USA TODAY data, with more than 240 people dying in the isolated corner of
the state.
Anna Marie Rondon, executive director of the New Mexico Social Justice and Equity Institute in McKinley County (who is Diné, as the Navajo people call themselves), said the ravages of
COVID-19 are not an isolated tragedy but the latest chapter in Indigenous people’s long history of abuse and neglect from the U.S. government.
On the Navajo Nation, inadequate resources have resulted in widespread water poverty, food insecurity and high rates of illness. These daily realities were devastating long before the
pandemic, but they’ve also helped fuel a high COVID-19 death rate.
""It's really an unbelievable chain of oppression – it's still squeezing us, it still has its grip,"" Rondon said. ""And it's still killing us.""
Food deserts make people vulnerable
In California, Imperial Valley is considered the nation’s winter breadbasket, producing 80% of the country’s fresh vegetables during the cold months. But the predominantly Hispanic
workers who pick alfalfa, lettuce, sugar beets and carrots can rarely afford to buy them.
Nearly 75% of adults and 13% of children are obese or overweight for their age, according to state data. On the other end of the spectrum, 31% of kids in Imperial County don't get
enough to eat each day, according to a 2018 report by Feeding America, a national anti-hunger organization based in Washington, D.C.
""If they're already on food stamps, to spend the extra money to get fruits and vegetables, it's expensive,"" said Jessica Solorio, executive director of Spread the Love, a local food bank.
Those figures show why COVID-19 has been so fatal in the county, with 16 deaths per 10,000, nearly three times the national average, according to the USA TODAY analysis.
Cultural barriers complicate response
In San Francisco, community activists are worried that the number of Asian Americans getting COVID-19 is being vastly underreported.
Of the county’s nearly 12,000 positive test results, only 12% are Asian American, yet Asian Americans have made up 38% of the death count. Experts attribute that alarming disconnect to
a number of factors, including the fear of losing a job after a positive test, language barriers, lack of health care, growing anti-Asian hate crimes, and what’s called the ""model-minority
myth"" – an assumption that education and financial successes enjoyed by some Asian Americans applies to all 20-some Asian ethnicities.
Judy Young, executive director of the Southeast Asian Development Center, a nonprofit that helps residents from Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, said her community suffers from an average
household income a quarter of the city’s average, low high school graduation rates and obstacles to health care. Add a COVID-19 testing regime tailored to those proficient in English and
an often fatalistic attitude toward the pandemic in the community, and Young said the virus has been painful to the Asian American community.
""I've asked our clients why they're not getting tested,"" she said. ""Often the reaction I get is, 'I'm going to die anyway, and if I test positive, then I can't go to work.""
'We become invisible'
Ask Beverly Wright, executive director of the Deep South Center for Environmental Justice, why so many people of color across the U.S. are dying from COVID-19 and she goes back 400
years to the arrival of the first enslaved Africans to colonial U.S. shores.
Racism is so entrenched in the American way of life, she said, that it's impossible to separate the high death rates of marginalized communities from the nation’s historic treatment of each
of them. From the broken promises of reparations to the terrible treatment of immigrants, from redlining practices that excluded Black Americans from homeownership to the GI Bill money
that went mostly to white service members returning from World War II, Wright says COVID-19 is once again revealing the precarious position people of color often find themselves in.
But with no national response from the federal government and only limited actions taken by states or localities, Wright said her people are still stuck in the same situation: invisible.
""We have built-in systems that work against Black people moving up the economic ladder,"" Wright said. ""That pattern continues.
""Racism is so entrenched that we become invisible.""

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that an outbreak of the viral disease COVID-19 - first identified in December 2019 in
Wuhan, China - had reached the level of a global pandemic. Citing concerns with the alarming levels of spread and severity, the WHO called for
governments to take urgent and aggressive action to stop the spread of the virus.
International human rights law guarantees everyone the right to the highest attainable standard of health and obligates governments to take steps to
prevent threats to public health and to provide medical care to those who need it. Human rights law also recognizes that in the context of serious public
health threats and public emergencies threatening the life of the nation, restrictions on some rights can be justified when they have a legal basis, are
strictly necessary, based on scientific evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human dignity,
subject to review, and proportionate to achieve the objective.
The scale and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic clearly rises to the level of a public health threat that could justify restrictions on certain rights, such
as those that result from the imposition of quarantine or isolation limiting freedom of movement. At the same time, careful attention to human rights
such as non-discrimination and human rights principles such as transparency and respect for human dignity can foster an effective response amidst the
turmoil and disruption that inevitably results in times of crisis and limit the harms that can come from the imposition of overly broad measures that do
not meet the above criteria.
This document provides an overview of human rights concerns posed by the coronavirus outbreak, drawing on examples of government responses to
date, and recommends ways governments and other actors can respect human rights in their response.

COVID-19
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a new coronavirus first identified in December 2019. Coronaviruses are a family of viruses known to cause
respiratory infections. There is no vaccine yet to prevent COVID-19, and no specific treatment for it, other than managing the symptoms.
By mid-March 2020, more than 150 countries had reported cases of COVID-19, and the WHO reported there were more than 200,000 cases worldwide.
More than 7,000 people had died and the numbers were continuing to rise at an alarming rate.
Applicable International Standards
Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which most countries have adopted, everyone has the right to the highest
attainable standard of physical and mental health. Governments are obligated to take effective steps for the prevention, treatment and control of
epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases.
The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, which monitors state compliance with the covenant, has stated that:
The right to health is closely related to and dependent upon the realization of other human rights, as contained in the International Bill of Rights,
including the rights to food, housing, work, education, human dignity, life, non-discrimination, equality, the prohibition against torture, privacy, access to
information, and the freedoms of association, assembly and movement. These and other rights and freedoms address integral components of the right to
health.
The right to health provides that health facilities, goods, and services should be:
available in sufficient quantity,
accessible to everyone without discrimination, and affordable for all, even marginalized groups;
acceptable, meaning respectful of medical ethics and culturally appropriate; and
scientifically and medically appropriate and of good quality. The Siracusa Principles, adopted by the UN Economic and Social Council in 1984, and UN
Human Rights Committee general comments on states of emergency and freedom of movement provide authoritative guidance on government
responses that restrict human rights for reasons of public health or national emergency. Any measures taken to protect the population that limit people's
rights and freedoms must be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. States of emergency need to be limited in duration and any curtailment of rights
needs to take into consideration the disproportionate impact on specific populations or marginalized groups.
On March 16, 2020, a group of UN human rights experts said that emergency declarations based on the COVID-19 outbreak should not be used as a
basis to target particular groups, minorities, or individuals. It should not function as a cover for repressive action under the guise of protecting health...
and should not be used simply to quash dissent.
The Siracusa Principles specically state that restrictions should, at a minimum, be:
provided for and carried out in accordance with the law;
directed toward a legitimate objective of general interest;
strictly necessary in a democratic society to achieve the objective;
the least intrusive and restrictive available to reach the objective;
based on scientic evidence and neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application; and
of limited duration, respectful of human dignity, and subject to review. Human Rights Concerns
Protect freedom of expression and ensure access to critical information
Under international human rights law, governments have an obligation to protect the right to freedom of expression, including the right to seek, receive,
and impart information of all kinds, regardless of frontiers. Permissible restrictions on freedom of expression for reasons of public health, noted above,
may not put in jeopardy the right itself.

Governments are responsible for providing information necessary for the protection and promotion of rights, including the right to health. The Committee
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights regards as a core obligation providing education and access to information concerning the main health problems
in the community, including methods of preventing and controlling them. A rights-respecting response to COVID-19 needs to ensure that accurate and
up-to-date information about the virus, access to services, service disruptions, and other aspects of the response to the outbreak is readily available and
accessible to all.
In a number of countries, governments have failed to uphold the right to freedom of expression, taking actions against journalists and healthcare
workers. This ultimately limited effective communication about the onset of the disease and undermined trust in government actions:
China's government initially withheld basic information about the coronavirus from the public, underreported cases of infection, downplayed the severity
of the infection, and dismissed the likelihood of transmission between humans. Authorities detained people for reporting on the epidemic on social media
and internet users for rumor-mongering, censored online discussions of the epidemic, and curbed media reporting. In early January, Li Wenliang, a
doctor at a hospital in Wuhan where infected patients were being treated, was summoned by police for spreading rumors after he warned of the new
virus in an online chatroom. He died in early February from the virus.
In Iran, the outbreak emerged after authorities had severely damaged public trust by brutally repressing widespread anti-government protests and lying
about shooting down a civilian airliner. As a result, Iranian authorities have struggled to assure the public that government decision-making around the
COVID-19 outbreak has been in the public's best interests. The unusually high rate of reported cases of government officials contracting the virus, as
well as the inconsistency in figures announced by officials and domestic media sources, have heightened concerns that the data is either being
deliberately underreported or poorly collected and analyzed.
In Thailand, whistleblowers in the public health sector and online journalists have faced retaliatory lawsuits and intimidation from authorities after they
criticized government responses to the outbreak, raised concerns about a possible cover-up, and reported alleged corruption related to the hoarding and
profiteering of surgical masks and other supplies. Some medical personnel were also threatened with disciplinary action - including termination of
employment contracts and revocation of their licenses - for speaking out about the severe shortage of essential supplies in hospitals across the country.
A few countries prioritized open communication and transparent reporting on the number of cases:
Taiwan took swift steps to combat the virus, including promptly making credible information widely available to the public. Daily press briefings by health
officials and public service announcements aim to counter misinformation and have helped to calm panic, restore public confidence, and encourage
people's assistance in the crisis.
Singapore's government published and regularly updated detailed statistics on the number and rate of infections and recoveries.
South Korea's government also published health data and health officials gave two daily briefings to establish public confidence and promote citizen
vigilance.
In Italy, inconsistent messages from public officials, including for domestic political reasons, may initially have diluted the impact of public service
announcements about proper hygiene and social distancing. The government has held daily news conferences to share data and implemented an
aggressive public campaign about better practices to protect oneself and others from spreading the virus.
Recommendations:
Governments should fully respect the rights to freedom of expression and access to information, and only restrict them as international standards
permit.
Governments should ensure that the information they provide to the public regarding COVID-19 is accurate, timely, and consistent with human rights
principles. This is important for addressing false and misleading information.
All information about COVID-19 should be accessible and available in multiple languages, including for those with low or no literacy. This should include
qualified sign language interpretation for televised announcements, as Taiwan has done; websites that are accessible to people with vision, hearing,
learning, and other disabilities; and telephone-based services that have text capabilities for people who are deaf or hard of hearing. Communications
should utilize plain language to maximize understanding. Age appropriate information should be provided to children to help them take steps to protect
themselves.
Health data is particularly sensitive, and the publication of information online can pose a significant risk to affected persons and in particular people who
are already in positions of vulnerability or marginalization in society. Rights-based legal safeguards should govern the appropriate use and handling of
personal health data.
Reliable and unfettered access to the internet should be maintained and steps should be taken to ensure internet access be available to people with low
incomes. The US Federal Communications Commission's Keep Americans Connected pledge commits participating companies not to terminate service to
customers who are unable to pay their bills due to the disruptions caused by the coronavirus pandemic, to waive any late fees, and to open Wi-Fi
hotspots to any American who needs them. Further steps could be taken to lift data caps, upgrade speeds, and eliminate eligibility requirements for any
low-income targeted plans during the pandemic.
Ensure quarantines, lockdowns, and travel bans comply with rights norms
International human rights law, notably the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), requires that restrictions on rights for reasons of
public health or national emergency be lawful, necessary, and proportionate. Restrictions such as mandatory quarantine or isolation of symptomatic
people must, at a minimum, be carried out in accordance with the law. They must be strictly necessary to achieve a legitimate objective, based on
scientific evidence, proportionate to achieve that objective, neither arbitrary nor discriminatory in application, of limited duration, respectful of human
dignity, and subject to review.

Broad quarantines and lockdowns of indeterminate length rarely meet these criteria and are often imposed precipitously, without ensuring the protection
of those under quarantine - especially at-risk populations. Because such quarantines and lockdowns are difficult to impose and enforce uniformly, they
are often arbitrary or discriminatory in application.
Freedom of movement under international human rights law protects, in principle, the right of everyone to leave any country, to enter their own country
of nationality, and the right of everyone lawfully in a country to move freely in the whole territory of the country. Restrictions on these rights can only be
imposed when lawful, for a legitimate purpose, and when the restrictions are proportionate, including in considering their impact. Travel bans and
restrictions on freedom of movement may not be discriminatory nor have the effect of denying people the right to seek asylum or of violating the
absolute ban on being returned to where they face persecution or torture.
Governments have broad authority under international law to ban visitors and migrants from other countries. However, domestic and international travel
bans historically have often had limited effectiveness in preventing transmission, and may in fact accelerate disease spread if people flee from quarantine
zones prior to their imposition.
In China, the government imposed an overly broad quarantine with little respect for rights:
In mid-January, authorities in China quarantined close to 60 million people in two days in an effort to limit transmission from the city of Wuhan in Hubei
province, where the virus was first reported, even though by the time the quarantine started, 5 million of Wuhan's 11 million residents had left the city.
Many residents in cities under quarantine expressed difficulties obtaining medical care and other life necessities, and chilling stories have emerged of
deaths and illnesses: A boy with cerebral palsy died because no one took care of him after his father was taken to be quarantined. A woman with
leukemia died after being turned away by several hospitals because of concerns about cross-infection. A mother desperately pleaded to the police to let
her daughter with leukemia through a checkpoint at a bridge to get chemotherapy. A man with kidney disease jumped to his death from his apartment
balcony after he couldn't get access to health facilities for dialysis. Authorities have also reportedly used various intrusive containment measures:
barricading shut the doors of suspected infected families with metal poles, arresting people for refusing to wear masks, and flying drones with
loudspeakers to scold people who went outside without masks. The authorities did little to combat discrimination against people from Wuhan or Hubei
province who traveled elsewhere in China.
In Italy the government has imposed a lockdown but with greater protections for individual rights. The Italian government adopted progressively
restrictive measures since the first major outbreak of COVID-19 cases in the country in late February. Authorities initially placed ten towns in Lombardy
and one in Veneto under strict quarantine, prohibiting residents from leaving the areas. At the same time, they closed schools in affected regions. Citing
a surge in cases and an increasingly unsustainable burden on the public healthcare system, the government on March 8 imposed a slew of new
measures on much of the country's north that put in place much more severe restrictions on movement and basic freedoms. The next day, the measures
were applied across the country. Further measures imposed included restrictions on travel except for essential work or health reasons (upon self-
certification), closure of all cultural centers (cinemas, museums), and cancellation of sports events and public gatherings. On March 11 the government
closed all bars, restaurants, and stores except food markets and pharmacies (and a few other exceptions) across the country. People who disobey the
travel restrictions without a valid reason can be fined up to 206 euros and face a three-month prison term. All schools and universities were closed
throughout the country. People have been allowed out to shop for essential items, exercise, work (if unable to perform work from home), and for health
reasons (including care for a sick relative).
Other governments, such as those in South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore have responded to the outbreak without enacting sweeping
restrictions on personal liberty, but have reduced the number of travelers from other countries with significant outbreaks. In South Korea, the
government adopted proactive and ramped-up testing for COVID-19. It focused on identifying infection hotspots, conducting a large number of tests on
at-risk people without charge, disinfecting streets in areas with high numbers of infections, setting up drive-through testing centers, and promoting
social distancing. In Hong Kong, there have been concerted efforts to promote social distancing, handwashing, and mask-wearing. Taiwan proactively
identified patients who sought health care for symptoms of respiratory illness and had some tested for COVID-19. It also set up a system that alerts the
authorities based on travel history and symptoms during clinical visits to aid in case identification and monitoring. Singapore adopted a contact-tracing
program for those confirmed to have the virus, among other measures. However, the government's decision to deport four foreign workers for violating a
mandatory 14-day leave of absence from work and ban them from working in the country raises concern of disproportionate penalties.
Recommendations:
Governments should avoid sweeping and overly broad restrictions on movement and personal liberty, and only move towards mandatory restrictions
when scientifically warranted and necessary and when mechanisms for support of those affected can be ensured. A letter from more than 800 public
health and legal experts in the US stated, Voluntary self-isolation measures [combined with education, widespread screening, and universal access to
treatment] are more likely to induce cooperation and protect public trust than coercive measures and are more likely to prevent attempts to avoid
contact with the healthcare system.
When quarantines or lockdowns are imposed, governments are obligated to ensure access to food, water, health care, and care-giving support. Many
older people and people with disabilities rely on uninterrupted home and community services and support. Ensuring continuity of these services and
operations means that public agencies, community organizations, health care providers, and other essential service providers are able to continue
performing essential functions to meet the needs of older people and people with disabilities. Government strategies should minimize disruption in
services and develop contingent sources of comparable services. Disruption of community-based services can result in the institutionalization of persons
with disabilities and older people, which can lead to negative health outcomes, including death, as discussed below.
Protect people in custody and in institutions
COVID-19, like other infectious diseases, poses a higher risk to populations that live in close proximity to each other. And it disproportionately affects
older people and individuals with underlying illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and hypertension. Eighty
percent of the people who have died of COVID-19 in China were over the age of 60.

This risk is particularly acute in places of detention, such as prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers, as well as residential institutions for people
with disabilities and nursing facilities for older people, where the virus can spread rapidly, especially if access to health care is already poor. States have
an obligation to ensure medical care for those in their custody at least equivalent to that available to the general population, and must not deny or limit
detainees, including asylum seekers or undocumented migrants, equal access to preventive, curative or palliative health care. Asylum seekers, refugees
living in camps, and people experiencing homelessness may also be at increased risk because of their lack of access to adequate water and hygiene
facilities.
In nursing facilities and other settings with large numbers of older people, visitor policies should balance the protection of older and at-risk residents
with their need for family and connection. The US Department of Veterans Affairs announced a no visitors policy at its 134 nursing homes around the
country in response to the risk of COVID-19. While the risk to older people is serious, blanket policies do not take into account public health guidance or
the needs of older people.
People in prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers frequently do not receive adequate health care under normal circumstances, even in
economically developed countries. Severely substandard health care has contributed to recent deaths of immigrants in the custody of US Immigration
and Customs Enforcement. Populations in custody often include older people and people with serious chronic health conditions, meaning they are at
greater risk for illness from COVID-19.
Many people in US jails have not been convicted of a crime but are locked up simply because they cannot afford to pay the bail set in their case. Older
men and women are the fastest growing group in US prisons due to lengthy sentences, and prison officials already have difficulty providing them
appropriate medical care. As a response, in one county in the US state of Ohio, the courts expedited review of people in jail, releasing some and
transferring others to prisons. The American Civil Liberties Union has filed a lawsuit that seeks to challenge ongoing immigrant detention in the context
of the virus.
Prisoners in Iran have reportedly tested positive for the coronavirus, including in Evin prison in Tehran and in the cities of Euromieh and Rasht. In an
open letter in February, families of 25 prisoners detained for peaceful activism sought their at least temporary release amid the outbreak and lack of
sufficient prison medical care. In March, the Iranian judiciary ¼Դ¾ÅҴ! ¡ÒÃÍéҧÍԧ¡ÒÃàª×èÍÁâ§ËÅÒÂÁԵÔäÁè¶١µéͧ  about 85,000 prisoners for the Persian
New Year (Nowruz), a substantially greater number than normal for the holiday, apparently because of health concerns surrounding the coronavirus
outbreak. However, dozens of human rights defenders and others held on vaguely defined national security crimes remained in prison.
On March 12, Bahrain's King Hamad bin Isa Al-Khalifa reportedly pardoned 901 detainees for humanitarian reasons, in the backdrop of the current
circumstances, likely in reference to the coronavirus outbreak. The Ministry of Interior announced that another 585 detainees would be released and
granted non-custodial sentences.
In Italy, prisoners in over 40 prisons have protested over fears of contagion in overcrowded facilities and against bans on family visits and supervised
release during the coronavirus pandemic. In response, authorities have authorized for the first time the use of email and Skype for contact between
prisoners and their families and for educational purposes and announced a plan to release and place under house arrest prisoners with less than 18
months on their sentence. The main prisoner rights organization in Italy, Antigone, estimated this could benefit at most 3,000 prisoners, while the
penitentiary system is at around 14,000 over capacity. The organization called for broader measures to ensure the release of a greater number of
detainees, including in particular older detainees and those with at-risk health profiles, among other measures. Civil society organizations have also
called for alternatives to detention for all people currently detained in immigration detention centers in Italy due to the increased risk of infection and no
prospect for deportation.
Recommendations:
Government agencies with authority over people housed in prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers should consider reducing their populations
through appropriate supervised or early release of low-risk category of detainees including for example, those whose scheduled release may be soon,
those who are in pre-trial detention for non-violent and lesser offenses, or whose continued detention is similarly unnecessary or not justified. Detained
individuals at high risk of suffering serious effects from the virus, such as older people and people with underlying health conditions, should also be
considered for similar release with regard to whether the detention facility has the capacity to protect their health, including guaranteed access to
treatment, and taking into consideration factors such as the gravity of the crime committed and time served.
If safe and legal deportations are suspended due to the virus, the legal justification for detaining people pending deportation may no longer exist. In
these cases, authorities should release detainees and institute alternatives to detention.
Authorities that operate prisons, jails, and immigration detention centers should publicly disclose their plans of action to reduce the risk of coronavirus
infection in their facilities and the steps they will take to contain the infection and protect prisoners, prison staff, and visitors, if cases of the virus or
exposure to it are present. Persons in any form of detention have the same right to health as the non-incarcerated population and are entitled to the
same standards of prevention and treatment. The detained population and the general population have a compelling interest to know in advance what
plans authorities have put in place for handling COVID-19.
Authorities should take steps to ensure they are appropriately coordinating with public health departments and communicating openly with staff and
people in custody. They should also screen and test for COVID-19 according to the most recent recommendations of health authorities. They should
provide appropriate hygiene training and supplies and ensure that all areas susceptible to harboring the virus and accessible to prisoners, prison staff,
and visitors, are disinfected regularly, consistent with accepted best practices. They should develop plans for housing people exposed to or infected with
the virus. They should ensure that individuals released or put on supervised leave have access to appropriate accommodations and health care. Any
plans for lockdowns or isolation should be limited in scope and duration based on the best science available, and they should not be or seem punitive, as
fear of being placed in lockdowns or isolation could delay people notifying medical staff if they experience symptoms of infection. Detention centers
should consider alternative strategies such as video conferencing for individuals to be able to connect with family or legal counsel.
Governments seeking to contain the spread of the virus should evaluate and modify as necessary during the time of the outbreak measures used to
enforce immigration laws, including court hearings and check-ins with authorities as alternatives to detention. Authorities should provide public notice
6/24/2021
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
https://www-proquest-com.falcon.lib.csub.edu/printviewfile?accountid=10345
6/11
that there will be no negative repercussions for missed court dates or check-ins during the time of the outbreak. Authorities should stop arbitrary
detentions of migrants, seek alternatives to detention for people currently in immigration detention, and opt for release where possible, particularly for
those in high-risk categories if infected and for people who are being held with no prospect for imminent, safe, and legal deportation.
In the absence of adequate state support, the United Nations and other inter-governmental agencies should urgently press for access to formal and
informal detention facilities to provide detainees with life-saving assistance.
Governments housing refugees and asylum seekers should ensure their response to COVID-19 includes prevention and treatment measures, with
particular attention to measures to alleviate overcrowding in detention centers and camps, improve sanitation and access to health care, and resort to
time-bound quarantines and isolation only as necessary.
Ensure protection of health workers
As part of the right to health, the ICESCR provides that governments should create conditions that would assure to all medical service and medical
attention in the event of sickness.
Governments have an obligation to minimize the risk of occupational accidents and diseases including by ensuring workers have health information and
adequate protective clothing and equipment. This means providing health workers and others involved in the COVID-19 response with appropriate
training in infection control and with appropriate protective gear.
Combating the spread of COVID-19 requires that health facilities have adequate water, sanitation, hygiene, healthcare waste management, and cleaning.
A 2019 baseline report by WHO and the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) found that [a]n estimated 896 million people use health care facilities with no
water service and 1.5 billion use facilities with no sanitation service.
Human Rights Watch research into hospital-acquired infections in Hungary suggests the nation's mismanaged, underfunded, and understaffed public
healthcare system is poorly equipped to handle a COVID-19 outbreak. Patients and medical experts described a lack of basic hygiene protocol, lack of
isolation rooms, and a shortage of health professionals, doctors and nurses, and medical supplies in general. One doctor said it was nearly impossible to
get essential items like disinfectant and respirator masks, which are critical to protect against viruses.
In Venezuela, Human Rights Watch has documented a health system in utter collapse. Hospitals have closed or are operating at a fraction of their
capacity, many without regular access to electricity or water. Vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles and diphtheria have returned long before the
pandemic hit.
Broad sanctions imposed by the US on Iran have drastically constrained the ability of the country to finance humanitarian imports, including medicines.
This has caused serious hardships for ordinary Iranians. Concerned governments should support Iran's efforts to combat the COVID-19, including by
providing access to medical devices and testing kits.
In Thailand, public health capacity has been diminished by corruption. Medical personnel lack surgical masks and local supplies have been diverted and
shipped to China and other markets in part due to corruption.
The Health Ministry in Egypt in February sent doctors and medical teams to a quarantine facility without informing them that their transfer was part of
the COVID-19 response or of the risks entailed. Medical staff said they were tricked into the assignment.
In Lebanon, the spokesperson for the country's medical supply importers told Human Rights Watch that the country had run out of gloves, masks,
gowns, and other supplies necessary to deal with the coronavirus outbreak due to the financial crisis that had prevented them from importing needed
goods. She added that medical supply importers have brought in just US$10 million of the $120 million in goods they have sought since October and
nearly all transactions have been frozen since February due to the country's ongoing economic crisis. The head of the Syndicate of Private Hospitals said
that the government owes private hospitals more than $1.3 billion, compromising their ability to pay staff and purchase medical equipment. Yet the
Lebanese government has not put in place any measures to address the economic crisis threatening access to medical care, medicine, and medical
equipment.
Recommendations:
Governments should take measures so that health care is available to all, accessible without discrimination, affordable, respectful of medical ethics,
culturally appropriate, and of good quality.
Governments should ensure that health workers have access to appropriate protective equipment and that social protection programs are in place for the
families of workers who die or become ill as a result of their work, and ensure such programs include informal workers, who represent a large share of
the caregiving sector.
In past epidemics, fear of exposure has led to attacks on health workers. Governments should monitor for such attacks to deter them, and ensure that
they can quickly, adequately, and appropriately respond if attacks occur.
Fulfill the right to education-even if schools are temporarily closed
Many countries have closed schools since the COVID-19 outbreak, disrupting the learning and education of hundreds of millions of students. In times of
crises, schools provide children with a sense of stability and normalcy and ensure children have a routine and are emotionally supported to cope with a
changing situation. Schools also provide important spaces for children and their families to learn about hygiene, appropriate handwashing techniques,
and coping with situations that will break routines. Without access to schools, this prime responsibility falls on parents, guardians, and caregivers. When
schools are closed, government agencies should step in to provide clear and accurate public health information through appropriate media.

To ensure education systems respond adequately, UNESCO has recommended that states adopt a variety of hi-tech, low-tech and no tech solutions to
assure the continuity of learning. In many countries, teachers already use online learning platforms to complement normal contact hours in classrooms
for homework, classroom exercises, and research, and many students have access to technological equipment at home. However, not all countries,
communities, families, or social groups have adequate internet access, and many children live in places with frequent government-led internet
shutdowns.
Recommendations:
Online learning should be used to mitigate the immediate impact of lost normal school time. Schools deploying educational technology for online learning
should ensure the tools protect child rights and privacy. Governments should attempt to recover missed in-person class time once schools reopen.
Governments should adopt measures to mitigate the disproportionate effects on children who already experience barriers to education, or who are
marginalized for various reasons - including girls, those with disabilities, those affected by their location, their family situation, and other inequalities.
Governments should focus on adopting strategies that support all students through closures - for example, monitoring students most at risk and
ensuring students receive printed or online materials on time, with particular attention provided to students with disabilities who may require adapted,
accessible material.
Governments should adopt mitigation strategies, for example by working with teachers, school officials, and teachers' unions and associations to factor
in plans to recover teaching or contact hours lost, adjusting school calendars and exam schedules, and ensuring fair compensation for teachers and
school personnel who are working additional hours.
In countries with high numbers of out-of-school children, school closures may jeopardize efforts to increase school enrollments and retention, particularly
at the secondary level. Governments should place additional measures to monitor compliance with compulsory education - and ensure government
education officials monitor school returns once schools reopen. Education officials should focus attention on areas with high incidence of child labor or
child marriage and ensure all children return to school. Officials should also ensure that schools with refugee students adopt outreach measures to
ensure refugee children return to school, including by working with refugee parent groups and community leaders.
Sudden school closures may also leave low-income families struggling to make ends meet and provide necessities. Governments should guarantee
continued meal provision during school closures for children in low-income families who will miss subsidized meals.
Address disproportionate impacts on women and girls
Outbreaks of disease often have gendered impacts. Human Rights Watch found that the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak and the 2015-2016 outbreak
of the mosquito-borne Zika virus in Brazil had particularly harmful impacts on women and girls and reinforced longstanding gender inequity. News
reports and public health analysis suggest that COVID-19 is disproportionately affecting women in a number of ways.
Though risks specific to pregnant women exposed to COVID-19 are not yet clear, the outbreak could negatively affect sexual and reproductive health and
rights. Overloaded health systems, reallocation of resources, shortages of medical supplies, and disruptions of global supply chains could harm women's
access to contraception and pre- and post-natal and birth care. Although the risk of infection through breastfeeding is not known, the UN Population
Fund has recommended that breastfeeding mothers who become ill should not be separated from their infants. Past epidemics, such as the Ebola
outbreak in Sierra Leone, have impacted the availability of routine prenatal and maternity care, leaving women more at risk to preventable maternal
deaths or morbidities.
In China, press reports suggest an increase in domestic violence under quarantine. Crises - and lockdowns - can trigger greater incidence of domestic
violence for reasons including increased stress, cramped and difficult living conditions, and breakdowns in community support mechanisms. Crises can
often further limit women's ability to get away from abuse, and place victims in an environment without appropriate access to services, such as safe
shelter away from abusers and accountability for abuse.
Women globally do almost 2.5 times as much unpaid care and domestic work as men, and they are more likely than men to face additional care giving
responsibilities when schools close, making it harder to maintain paid employment. Japan responded to the potential for a disproportionate impact on
families with young children by offering to offset costs to businesses for workers taking paid leave to care for children during school closures, though the
amount offered was low. Italy was considering measures to mitigate the effects of the lockdown on families with children. These could include
emergency paid parental leave or vouchers for families with children up to 12 years old (or children with disabilities without any age limit) who need to
pay for childcare amid the prolonged school closures.
Up to 95 percent of female workers in some regions work in the informal sector where there is no job security, and no safety net if a crisis like COVID-19
destroys their earnings. Informal work includes many occupations most likely to be harmed by a quarantine, social distancing, and economic slowdown,
such as street vendors, goods traders, and seasonal workers. Women are also over-represented in service industries that have been among the hardest
hit by the response to COVID-19.
Worldwide, 70 percent of health and social service providers are women - meaning women are at the front lines of containing the spread of COVID-19
and may be heavily exposed to the virus through work in the health sector. Fear in communities about the exposure that health workers face may lead
women in this sector to be shunned or face stigma, adding an extra burden to the challenge of trying to protect their and their families' health. This may
manifest itself, for example, in trying to access or secure childcare while they work on the front lines.
Some female care workers are migrant domestic workers. They can be vulnerable to abusive employment conditions in normal times, and are at
heightened risk of abuse, losing employment, being frontline caregivers without adequate protections, and of being trapped and unable to reach their
homes during a crisis. They may also face barriers to protecting their own health.
Moves toward telecommuting - for school and work - as a means of social distancing can disproportionately harm women and girls. Women are up to 31
percent less likely to have internet access than men in some countries, and worldwide about 327 million fewer women than men have a smartphone.

Even when women have access to the internet, gender disparities may make them less able to use it for reasons including cost, socialization, and family
pressures. When multiple members of a household need access to limited computing resources within the home, gender inequality may mean women
and girls have less access.
Recommendations:
Authorities should take steps to mitigate gendered impacts and ensure that responses do not perpetuate gender inequity.
When education is moved online, governments and education providers should monitor participation and retention of students in online courses for a
gendered impact and respond quickly with strategies to retain and reengage women and girls if their participation falls off. They should also address the
particular risks of job losses to women who may take on additional caregiving during school closures.
Measures designed to assist workers affected by the pandemic should ensure the assistance of workers in informal work and service industries, who are
predominantly women.
Governments should ensure public awareness campaigns address how victims of domestic violence can access services, and should ensure that services
are available to all victims of domestic violence, including those living in areas under movement restrictions or under quarantine and those infected with
COVID-19.
Governments should support frontline health and social service care workers with the recognition that these workers are mostly women. Support should
include consideration of their needs as caregivers within their own families and the impact of stigma on them and their families.
Both source and destination countries for migrant domestic workers should adopt special measures to locate and assist migrant domestic workers to
prevent abusive labor conditions and provide assistance relating to managing COVID-19.
Governments and international bodies should closely monitor the impact of COVID-19 on pregnant women and act to mitigate the impact of the
pandemic on the right of women and girls to access sexual and reproductive health services.
Root out discrimination and stigma, protect patient confidentiality
During previous public health crises, people with infection or disease and their families have often faced discrimination and stigma. For example, Human
Rights Watch found that people living with HIV in Kenya, South Africa, the Philippines, and the US faced discrimination and stigma due to their HIV
status and have been prevented from accessing health care, getting jobs, and attending school. Public health research has shown that survivors of Ebola
in West Africa have faced harmful stigma that, in some cases, has led to eviction, loss of employment, abandonment, violence, and other consequences.
Since the coronavirus outbreak, news reports from a number of countries have documented bias, racism, xenophobia, and discrimination against people
of Asian descent. Incidents include physical attacks and beatings, violent bullying in schools, angry threats, discrimination at school or in workplaces,
and the use of derogatory language in news reports and on social media platforms, among others. Since January, media have reported alarming
incidents of hate crimes in the United Kingdom, the US, Spain, and Italy, among other countries, targeting people of Asian descent, apparently linked to
COVID-19. Senior US government officials, including President Donald Trump, have stoked anti-Chinese sentiment by referring to the coronavirus as the
Chinese Virus, and in one incident reported by a White House correspondent, the Kung Flu. Anti-immigrant leaders like Victor Orban in Hungary and
Matteo Salvini in Italy have seized on the pandemic to stoke xenophobic sentiment.
South Korean authorities believe 63 percent of the then more than 7,300 confirmed cases in the country attended services held by the Shincheonji
Church of Jesus in the city of Daegu or had contact with attendees. In a statement, the church reported 4,000 cases of injustice against congregants
since the outbreak, including termination of employment, workplace bullying, domestic persecution, labeling, and slandering, and said the church was
being blamed as the main culprit of the COVID-19 outbreak.
Reporting by the BBC in South Korea found that public health alerts around the virus may not have adequately protected the privacy of individuals with
the virus.
Governments should take swift action to protect from attack individuals and communities who may be targeted as bearing responsibility for COVID-19,
thoroughly investigate all reported incidents, and hold perpetrators accountable.
Governments should ensure that response measures to COVID-19 do not target or discriminate against particular religious or ethnic groups, and that
responses are inclusive of and respect the rights of marginalized groups, including people with disabilities and older people. Governments should ensure
equal access to emergency services to people with disabilities and older people.
Governments should work to combat stigma and discrimination by training health workers on COVID-19, using mass media and school networks to
expand public awareness of human rights, and recognizing that the virus knows no boundaries and recognizes no distinctions of race, ethnicity, religion,
or nationality.
Governments should ensure that patient confidentiality is protected even as authorities take steps to identify those who may have been exposed to the
virus.
Ensure marginalized populations can access health care without discrimination
The UN high commissioner for human rights, Michelle Bachelet, a pediatrician by training, has said that [t]o effectively combat the outbreak means
ensuring everyone has access to treatment, and is not denied health care because they cannot pay for it or because of stigma.
In many countries, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people face discrimination in accessing health care. Human Rights Watch has
documented health care discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in countries including the US, Tanzania, Japan, Indonesia,

9/11
Bangladesh, Russia, and Lebanon. Because some LGBT people, including men who have sex with men and transgender people, are at particularly high
risk of acquiring or transmitting HIV and may be less likely to have access to testing and treatment than other populations, they may have compromised
immunities and be particularly at risk of suffering serious illness or death as a result of COVID-19.
Governments should ensure that all healthcare services related to COVID-19 are provided without stigma and discrimination of any kind, including on
the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity, and should make clear through public messaging campaigns that everyone has the right to access
health care.
Governments should take steps to create firewalls between healthcare providers and undocumented migrants to reassure vulnerable populations that
they do not risk reprisal or deportation if they access lifesaving care, especially in the context of seeking testing or treatment for COVID-19.
Governments should also ensure that financial barriers do not prevent people from accessing testing, preventative care, and treatment for COVID-19. In
the US, 28 million people do not have medical insurance and nearly a third of the country have difficulty affording payments for treatment even though
they are insured. Many people in the US report avoiding medical care or buying prescription medication because of cost, resulting in their condition
worsening. In an epidemic, avoidance of medical care not only harms those with the illness but also could lead to increased spread of coronavirus.
All governments have an obligation to ensure that a serious public health crisis does not also become a human rights crisis because people are unable to
access adequate medical care. Governments need to take steps to ensure everyone has affordable and accessible medical care and treatment options.
Protect community and civil society organizations
In many countries, civil society organizations are doing critical work to support efforts to stem the spread of the virus and ensure that those with COVID-
19 - or those living in isolation or under quarantine - have access to needed protection, care, and social services. Governments should protect and
support civil society organizations doing this work, as well as those reporting on the impacts of the outbreak.
During the 2014 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, nongovernmental groups, local newspapers, and community radio played a key role in public health
education.
In Hong Kong, ordinary people have organized themselves to create and distribute masks and hand sanitizers to the most vulnerable to fill policy gaps.
But the Chinese government has long maintained a stranglehold on nongovernmental organizations and some groups are struggling with reduced
funding during the outbreak.
In Italy, authorities have subjected nongovernment sea rescue organizations assisting migrants and asylum seekers to quarantines at dock despite crew
members and passengers testing negative for the virus. In a context in which civilian rescue missions have been consistently undermined, blocked, and
even criminalized, potentially unnecessary quarantines might be used to deter rescue at sea.
Governments should not exploit the coronavirus pandemic to criminalize or obstruct the work of civil society organizations.
Promote the rights to water and sanitation
The rights to water and to sanitation are part of the right to an adequate standard of living. The UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
has reaffirmed that the rights to water and sanitation are an essential component of the right to an adequate standard of living, and integrally related,
among other Covenant rights, to the right to health.
Billions of people around the world do not have access to safe drinking water. Yet, as the WHO has noted the provision of safe water, sanitation, and
hygienic conditions is essential to protecting human health during the COVID-19 outbreak. Prevention of human-to-human transmission of the COVID-19
virus may be supported by promotion of the rights to water and sanitation, and supporting water and wastewater infrastructure and technicians to
ensure good and consistently applied water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) and waste management practices in communities, homes, schools,
marketplaces, and healthcare facilities. More research is needed to understand the risk of contaminated drinking water, environmental transmission, and
how to ensure wastewater operators are trained and supported throughout the crisis.
Lack of potable water and sanitation at home, school, or in healthcare settings will make preventative measures difficult. In some cases, without
adequate water and sanitation these settings themselves may be a locus for the spread of the disease.
Venezuela's healthcare infrastructure is so weak that the most basic recommendation -handwashing - is difficult even for healthcare providers, who work
under difficult conditions. The Venezuelan doctors and nurses Human Rights Watch interviewed over the past few months said that soap and
disinfectants were virtually nonexistent in their clinics and hospitals. As inflation has risen and salaries have been devalued, it has become impossible for
them to bring in their own supplies. Public hospitals in Caracas, the capital, are also suffering regular water shortages. In remote hospitals, the
shortages have lasted weeks to months. Patients and personnel have been required to bring their own water for drinking and sometimes for flushing
toilets.
Governments should immediately suspend any water shutoffs for failure to pay. Discontinuing water services for failure to pay in any context is
incompatible with human rights and can be particularly harmful in the context of public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic.
Ensure humanitarian aid continues
According to the United Nations, a number of the many countries affected by COVID-19 are already facing crises due to conflicts, natural disasters, or
climate change. Many people in those crisis-hit countries rely on humanitarian aid to survive.
Governments should ensure that support for vital humanitarian operations carried out by the UN and other aid agencies does not suffer as a result of
COVID-19.

Jeannie Mai never thought the Bay Area in California, where she grew up, was racist. ""The Real"" host just
thought it was a case of a few bad apples.
She remembers when her aunts and uncles left Vietnam and came to stay with her family, racist words were
spray-painted on their car and on the side of her family's home. But overall, the neighborhood was peaceful.
""It felt like we all coexisted,"" Mai, 42, says of her predominantly Hispanic and Black neighborhood. ""There just
might have been a few individuals that didn't understand our culture and why we were there.""
Flash forward to today, and there has been a rise in Asian-American attacks in the U.S. – including in the Bay
Area.
Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus Chairperson Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif. and other lawmakers at a
virtual press conference last week said the attacks are part of a rise in anti-Asian American bias and xenophobia
amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
""What started as dirty looks and verbal assaults"" at the beginning of the pandemic ""escalated to physical attacks
and violence against innocent Asian Americans,"" Chu said. ""Just as many Asian Americans were preparing for
the Lunar New Year over the past few weeks, we saw a surge in anti-Asian violence.""
Chu cited several attacks against Asian Americans, including the killing of 84-year-old Thai American Vicha
Ratanapakdee, and a recent increase in violence against senior citizens in Oakland, California's, Chinatown.
""I'm sickened to my stomach and filled with so much anger and pain, just when we're already aware of racist
attacks and our systemic racism that spawns across the world and especially in our country for our Black
brothers and sisters,"" Mai says. ""What have we not learned from 2020? And now why are we attacking our most

vulnerable that are already trying every day just to survive COVID?""
'Gran Torino' star Bee Vang speaks out: Vang criticizes film's racial slurs, 'mainstreamed anti-Asian racism'
Mai is using her platform – via her talk show, social media presence and media interviews – to speak out against
these attacks. The TV personality has 2.4 million followers on Instagram, 632,000 subscribers to her YouTube
channel ""Hello Hunnay with Jeannie Mai"" and nearly 260,000 followers on Twitter.
People may be following her for her outfits or YouTube content, but they'll also be getting a dose of hard news.
""This is something that should be everybody's business,"" Mai says.
Other celebrities are raising awareness, too.
Earlier this month, actors Daniel Dae Kim and Daniel Wu offered a $25,000 reward for information that
ultimately led to an arrest in the case of an Oakland assault.
Mai is proud of her ""Asian brothers and sisters"" for making their voices heard.
She emphasizes that racism doesn't just impact the Asian community, but Asians should be included in
conversations about curbing racist behaviors.
""For everybody, not just the Asian community, racism and hate are pandemics that we have to fight to
eradicate,"" she says. ""But it starts with listening to our communities of color, planning and organizing to
support, speaking out about the problems and being active about the solution. You can't stand for (Black Lives
Matter), and then sit there sedentary about Asian attacks.""
Important: Here's why 'Minari' is truly an American story, even if the Golden Globes disagree
She doesn't think white Americans are educated enough about Asian history or culture – but she doesn't think
she's educated enough about Black history or culture either
""I don't think our school system is catered around educating us what we really need to know,"" she says.
She does, however, believe that racism can be unlearned. ""I believe racism is taught,"" she says. ""And it may not
be your parents sitting you down telling you specifically like, 'Don't trust those Asians. Don't be friends with
Black people.' No, I think it's in every grain of your upbringing.""
Mai's parents immigrated to the U.S. from Vietnam and escaped communism to come to a safer place.
""I've always been taught to just stay quiet, don't be the one to cause issues,"" she says.
She wants her community to know that they have a voice and need to protect one another, even if they don't
speak each other's languages. Beyond that, they should stand up for all their neighbors, too.
Mai is pleased that more Asian Americans have been appearing on television in series like ""Bling Empire"" on
Netflix and ""House of Ho"" on HBO Max. But she also wants to see programming that breaks away from the plot
points that fueled the mega hit movie ""Crazy Rich Asians.""
""Hollywood has this way of taking a stereotype and then marketing it down to the ground,"" she says. ""I would
just hope to see also a diverse depiction of what Asian Americans can look like, because not all of them are
crazy or rich.""

The fatal assault in San Francisco on a defenseless older man was the latest terrifying episode for Asian-
Americans, many of whom have endured racist taunts, rants and worse during the pandemic.
SAN FRANCISCO -- Weary of being cooped inside during the pandemic, Vicha Ratanapakdee was impatient for
his regular morning walk. He washed his face, put on a baseball cap and face mask and told his wife he would
have the coffee she had prepared for him when he returned. Then, on a brisk and misty Northern California
winter morning last month, he stepped outside.
About an hour later, Mr. Vicha, an 84-year-old retired auditor from Thailand, was violently slammed to the
ground by a man who charged into him at full speed. It was the type of forceful body blow that might have
knocked unconscious a young football player in full protective pads. For Mr. Vicha, who stood 5 feet 6 inches and
weighed 113 pounds, the attack was fatal. He died of a brain hemorrhage in a San Francisco hospital two days
later.
Captured on a neighbor's security camera, the video of the attack was watched with horror around the world.

Among Asian-Americans, many of whom have endured racist taunts, rants and worse during the coronavirus
pandemic, the killing of a defenseless older man became a rallying cry.
In the past year, researchers and activist groups have tallied thousands of racist incidents against Asian-
Americans, a surge in hate that they link to former President Donald J. Trump repeatedly referring to the
coronavirus as the ""Chinese virus."" Mr. Vicha's family described his killing as racially motivated, and it spurred a
campaign to raise awareness by many prominent Asian-Americans, who used the online hashtags
#JusticeForVicha and #StopAsianHate.
""The killing of Vicha was so plain as day,"" said Will Lex Ham, a New York-based actor, who after watching the
video flew from New York to San Francisco to help lead protests and safety patrols in Asian neighborhoods.
""There was no longer any way to ignore the violence that was happening to people who look like us.""
Antoine Watson, a 19-year-old resident of neighboring Daly City, was arrested two days after the attack and
charged with murder and elder abuse. He has pleaded not guilty but his lawyer admits that his client had an
""outburst of rage.""
Chesa Boudin, the San Francisco district attorney, says Mr. Vicha's death was heinous. But he says there is no
evidence to suggest it was motivated by racial animus.
Still, at a time when demands for racial justice have rocked a demographically evolving nation, the killing of Mr.
Vicha was notable for the galvanizing anger it brought to a diverse group that encompasses people of Chinese,
Japanese, Korean, South Asian and Southeast Asian heritage. The killing of a Thai man in America has given
voice to a united community under the umbrella of an Asian-American identity.
In the weeks since it happened, Mr. Vicha's death has become a symbol for the vulnerability that many in the
Asian-American community feel in this moment.
For his family, the death has been devastating both in California and abroad. In Thailand, the killing was front-
page news and described as barbaric, a life cut short in a family where siblings typically live into their late 90s,
relatives say.
Since his retirement in 1996 from Kasikornbank, one of Thailand's largest financial institutions, Mr. Vicha had
traveled between San Francisco, where his eldest daughter lives, and Thailand, where his youngest does.
For months Mr. Vicha had been pining to return to Thailand but was unable to because of the pandemic. He
disliked the chilly and wet San Francisco winter and missed his favorite southern Thai dishes and his extended
family and friends.
His brother, Surachai Ratanapakdee, 89, now the only surviving sibling of eight children, remembered Mr. Vicha
as studious and curious about the world outside the rice paddies, watermelon fields and orchards of the family
farm.
""Vicha was one of only a few people in the village who spoke English well,"" Mr. Surachai said.
Mr. Vicha went on to study at Thammasat University in Bangkok, one of the country's most prestigious
institutions.
His older daughter, Monthanus, described her father as a devoted Buddhist. She remains puzzled why on the
morning of the attack he left without his Buddhist amulet, a talisman of protection that he always wore around
his neck.
When Ms. Monthanus expressed her desire to go to graduate school two decades ago, Mr. Vicha supported her
decision to enroll in business school at the University of California, Berkeley. After her graduation, when Ms.
Firefox

Monthanus married and decided to stay in San Francisco, Mr. Vicha and his wife came to help raise their
grandchildren.
At the time of the attack, Mr. Vicha was only months away from being able to return to Thailand. On Jan. 15,
he received the first shot of the Moderna vaccine.
""We said, 'Dad, we are going to go back soon!""' Ms. Monthanus recalled.
Mr. Vicha's second shot was scheduled for Feb. 12, an appointment he would not live to make.
His killing came at a time when other disturbing images and reports were emerging from across the San
Francisco Bay. Three days later an attacker shoved a 91-year-old man in Oakland's Chinatown to the ground,
another video that rocketed around the internet.
That older victim has been wrongly described in many news accounts as Asian. Court documents give the
victim's name as Gilbert Diaz, and Carl Chan, a community leader and president of the Oakland Chinatown
Chamber of Commerce, said the victim was Latino. But Mr. Chan says he has tallied more than two dozen
assaults against Asian-American victims in Chinatown, including two other people shoved by the assailant
who knocked down Mr. Diaz.
Crime data from the district attorney offices in San Francisco County and Alameda County, which includes
Oakland, show that people of Asian descent were less likely last year to be victims of crimes than other ethnic
groups. In San Francisco, where 36 percent of the population is of Asian descent, 16 percent of crime victims
of known ethnicity were Asian, a similar situation to Alameda County.
But leaders of the Bay Area Asian community say crime statistics are misleading because Asian-American
residents, especially immigrants, often do not report assaults or robberies out of mistrust of the system or
language barriers. What is incontrovertible, say leaders of the Asian-American community nationwide, is that
the pandemic created a climate of fear and a feeling of insecurity from New York to California. In the past
week the California Legislature approved $1.4 million in funding to track and research racist incidents against
Asian-Americans.
""Our seniors are afraid to walk their own streets,"" Mr. Chan said.
Last year Ms. Monthanus, Mr. Vicha's daughter, was twice accosted on the street by people who told her to
leave the country because, the attackers said, Asians had caused the coronavirus.
Mr. Watson's lawyer, Sliman Nawabi, a public defender, said his client would not have been able to identify Mr.
Vicha's ethnicity through his face mask, cap and winter clothing. Mr. Nawabi described Mr. Watson as
someone who had struggled with anger.
In the hours before the attack, Mr. Watson had a string of setbacks. He left his home because of a family
dispute and got in a traffic accident in San Francisco at 2 a.m. He was cited by the San Francisco police for
running a stop sign and reckless driving and then slept that night in his car.
On that morning a number of security cameras in the area captured Mr. Watson banging a car with his hand,
according to Mr. Boudin, the district attorney.
""It appears that the defendant was in some sort of a temper tantrum,"" Mr. Boudin said.
It was then that Mr. Vicha walked up Anzavista Avenue, a street with views of skyscrapers in the city's
financial district.
A witness told police officers that Mr. Watson said something to the effect of ""What are you looking at?"" A
